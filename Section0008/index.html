<tr><td>The Dhamma and Vinaya impinge in such detail on so many areas of one’s life that no new bhikkhu can be expected to master them in a short time. For this reason, the Buddha arranged for a period of apprenticeship—called <em>nissaya</em>, or dependence—in which every newly ordained bhikkhu must train under the guidance of an experienced bhikkhu for at least five years before he can be considered competent to look after himself.</td>
<td>法與律對一個人生活的許多方面都有非常詳細的影響，以至於不可能指望新比丘能在短時間內掌握它們。因此，佛陀安排了一段學徒期，稱為“<em>nissaya</em>”或“依止”，每一位新出家的比丘必須在有經驗的比丘的指導下修行至少五年，才可以被認為有能力照顧自己。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This apprenticeship has formed the human context in which the practice of the Buddha’s teachings has been passed down for the past 2,600 years. To overlook it is to miss one of the basic parameters of the life of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus we will discuss it here first, before going on to the individual training rules of the Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>這種學徒期讓佛陀教法薪傳至今已將近二千六百年之久。忽視它就是錯過法與律之生活的基本要素之一。因此，我們先在這裡討論它，然後再討論《波羅提木叉》的個別學處。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Dependence is of two sorts: dependence on one’s preceptor (<em>upajjhāya</em>) and dependence on a teacher (<em>ācariya</em>). The relationships are similar—and in many details, identical—so the following discussion will use the word <em>mentor</em> to cover both preceptor and teacher wherever the pattern applies to both, and will distinguish them only where the patterns differ.</td>
<td>依止有兩種：對戒師的依止（<em>upajjhāya</em>，古譯為<em>和尚</em>）和對教授師的依止（<em>ācariya</em>，古譯為<em>阿闍梨</em>）。這些關係是相似的，並且在許多細節上是相同的，因此下面的討論，遇到二者通用相同的模式時，將使用<em>依止師</em>一詞來涵蓋戒師和教授師，並且僅在模式不同的地方區分戒師與教授師。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Choosing a mentor</strong></td>
<td><strong>選擇依止師</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Before ordination, one must choose a bhikkhu to act as one’s preceptor. The Mahāvagga (I.36-37) gives a long list of qualifications a bhikkhu must meet before he can act as a preceptor, while the Commentary divides the list into two levels: ideal and minimal qualifications. A bhikkhu who lacks the minimal qualifications incurs a dukkaṭa if he acts as a preceptor; a bhikkhu who meets the minimal but lacks the ideal qualifications is not an ideal person to give guidance, but he incurs no penalty in doing so.</td>
<td>在受具足戒之前，必須選擇一位比丘作為自己的戒師。<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0082a01">《大品》（一.36-37）</a>給出了比丘在能成為戒師之前必須滿足的一長串資格，而《義註》則將該列表分為兩個層次：理想資格和最低資格。缺乏最低資格的比丘，如果他擔任戒師，犯《突吉羅》。達到最低資格但缺乏理想資格的比丘不是給予指導的理想人選，但他擔任戒師不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The ideal qualifications:</em> The preceptor should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release; and should be able to train another person to the same level of attainment. He should have faith, a sense of shame, a sense of compunction (in the American sense of the term, i.e., an reluctance to do wrong for fear of its consequences), persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness (according to the Sub-commentary, this means that he is constantly mindful of whatever mental object is before the mind). He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and be possessed of right view. (This last point, the Commentary says, means that he does not adhere to the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism.) He should be competent to tend to a sick pupil or to find someone who will tend to him, and to dispel dissatisfaction in a pupil who wants to leave the celibate life.</td>
<td><em>理想資格：</em>戒師應有阿羅漢的戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見；並且應該能夠訓練他人達到相同的成就。他應該有信心、慚、愧（此詞在美式意義為因害怕後果而不願做錯事）、精進、不失正念（根據《複註》，這意味著他持續地正念於心面前的任何心理對象）。他應不違犯輕重諸戒，並且具足正見。（《義註》說，此處的正見意指不執著常見或斷見這二種極端。）他應該有能力照顧生病的弟子或找到願意照顧他的人，並且在弟子想離開梵行生活而還俗時，消除弟子的不滿。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Mahāvagga does not say outright that these are ideal, as opposed to minimal, qualifications, but the Commentary offers as proof the fact that one of a pupil’s duties is to try to allay any dissatisfaction that may arise in his preceptor. If all preceptors were arahants, no case of this sort would ever arise and there would be no need to mention it. Thus the Commentary concludes that arahantship, although ideal in a preceptor, is not necessary.</td>
<td>《大品》並沒有直截了當地說，相對於最低資格，這些是理想資格，但《義註》提供了這樣一個事實作為證據：弟子的職責之一是盡力減輕他的戒師可能產生的任何不滿。如果所有比丘都是阿羅漢，這種事就不會發生，也不用提及。因此，《義註》的結論是，阿羅漢果雖然對戒師來說是理想的，但並不是必要的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The minimal qualifications:</em> The preceptor must be learned and competent. According to the Commentary, this means that he knows enough of the Dhamma and Vinaya to govern a following and is competent enough to know what is and is not an offense. He must also be competent enough to allay, in line with the Dhamma, any anxiety that has arisen in his pupil; must know what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. He must have detailed knowledge of both Pāṭimokkhas (the one for the bhikkhus and the one for the bhikkhunīs) and be able to train the pupil in the bhikkhus’ customs (Com.: this means that he knows the Khandhakas), in the basic rules of the chaste life (Sub-com.: he knows both Vibhaṅgas), the higher Dhamma, and the higher Vinaya. He must be able, in line with the Dhamma, to pry his pupil away from a wrong view or to find someone who will help pry him away. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for ten years or more.</td>
<td><em>最低資格：</em>依止師必須博學且有能力。根據《義註》，這意味著他對法與律有足夠的了解來管理追隨者，並且有足夠的能力知道什麼是犯戒和不是犯戒。他還必須有足夠的能力，按照法，減輕弟子中出現的任何焦慮；必須知道什麼是犯戒，什麼是不犯戒，什麼是輕罪，什麼是重罪，以及懺罪的方法。他必須詳細了解兩部《波羅提木叉》（比丘的一部和比丘尼的一部），並且能夠訓練弟子遵循比丘的習俗（《義註》：這意味著他了解《犍度》），遵循梵行生活的基本戒條（《複註》：他知道兩部《經分別》），更高的法和更高的律。他必須能夠按照法，使弟子遠離邪見，或找到能幫助他脫離邪見的人。而且──最基本的要求──他必須出家為比丘十年或以上。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, for some reason, the new bhikkhu lives in a separate monastery from his preceptor, he must take dependence under a teacher, whose qualifications are precisely the same as those for a preceptor. Because the Mahāvagga (I.72.1) gives a dukkaṭa for taking dependence under an unconscientious bhikkhu, the new bhikkhu is allowed four to five days to observe his potential teacher’s conduct before taking dependence under him (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html#Mv.I.72">Mv.I.72.2</a>).</td>
<td>如果因為某些原因，新比丘與戒師住在不同的寺院，他就必須依止一位教授師，而教授師的資格與戒師的資格完全相同。因為<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0114a10">《大品》（一.72.1）</a>提到，依止一個不負責任的比丘，犯《突吉羅》，所以新比丘在依止之前可以有四到五天的時間來觀察他潛在的教授師的行為（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0114a14">《大品》.一.72.2</a>）。</td>

<tr><td><em>1. Attending to the mentor’s personal needs.</em> The Mahāvagga goes into great detail on this topic, giving precise instructions dealing with every conceivable way a pupil can be of service to his mentor. The Vinaya-mukha tries to reduce these duties to a few general principles, but this misses much of what the Mahāvagga has to offer, for the details are what show fine examples of mindfulness in action—the best way to fold a robe, clean a dwelling, and so forth—as well as indications of how one can use this aspect of one’s training to develop sensitivity to the needs of others. Still, the detailed instructions are so extensive that they would overburden the discussion in this chapter, so I have saved them for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixX">Appendix X</a>. Here I will simply give them in outline form. The pupil should:</td>
<td><em>1. 關注依止師的個人需求。</em> 《大品》對這個主題進行了非常詳細的闡述，對於弟子為依止師服務的每一種可能的方式都給出了精確的指示。《戒律入口》試圖將這些職責簡化為一些一般原則，但這錯過了《大品》所提供的大部分內容，因為細節是正念在行動中的典範——折疊袈裟、打掃住所等的最佳方法——以及如何利用訓練的這一方面來培養對他人需求的敏感度的指示。儘管如此，詳細的說明是如此廣泛，以至於它們會使本章的討論負擔過重，因此我將它們保存在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixX">附錄十</a>中。在這裡，我將簡單地以概要形式給出它們。弟子應該：<!-- TODO FIXME: replace link to 附錄十 -->

<tr><td>g. Study the Dhamma and Vinaya from him when he is prepared to teach. (The Mahāvagga describes this as “recitation” and “interrogation.” Recitation, according to the Commentary, means learning to memorize passages; interrogation, learning to investigate their meaning.)</td>
<td>g. 當依止師擬給予教導時，弟子應聽受研學法與律。（《大品》將其描述為「誦」和「問」。根據《義註》，「誦」的意思是學習記憶段落；「問」是學習探究其意義。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>h. Clean his dwelling and other parts of his dwelling complex, such as the restroom and storage rooms, when they get dirty.</td>

<tr><td><em>2. Assisting the mentor in any problems he may have with regard to the Dhamma and Vinaya.</em> The Mahāvagga lists the following examples:</td>
<td><em>2. 協助依止師解決有關法與律的任何問題。</em>《大品》列出了以下例子：</td>

<tr><td>b. If the preceptor begins to feel anxiety over his conduct with regard to the rules, the pupil should try to dispel that anxiety or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.</td>
<td>b. 如果戒師開始對自己遵守戒律的行為感到焦慮，弟子應該設法消除其焦慮，或者找其他可以消除其焦慮的人，或者給予他法的開示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>c. If the preceptor begins to hold to wrong views, the pupil should try to pry him away from those views or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.</td>

<tr><td>d. If the preceptor has committed a saṅghādisesa offense, the pupil should—to the best of his ability—help with the arrangements for penance, probation, and rehabilitation, or find someone else who can.</td>
<td>d. 如果戒師犯了《僧殘》罪，弟子應該盡其所能幫助安排別住（parivāsa）、摩那埵(mānatta)、與出罪(abbhāna)，或找其他可以幫助的人。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>e. If the Community is going to carry out a transaction against the mentor, the pupil should try to dissuade them from it. According to the Commentary, this means that he should go to the various members of the Community individually before the meeting and try to dissuade them from going through with the transaction. If he can’t dissuade them, he should try to get them to lessen its severity (say, from banishment to censure). If they are justified in carrying out the transaction, though, he should not object while the meeting is in progress. Once they have carried out the transaction, he should concentrate on helping his mentor behave so that they will rescind the transaction as quickly as possible.</td>
<td>e. 如果僧團要對依止師施行羯磨，弟子應該盡力勸阻他們。根據《義註》，這意味著他應該在僧團集會之前單獨去找僧團的各個成員，並試圖勸阻他們施行羯磨。如果他無法勸阻他們，他應該設法讓他們減輕其嚴重程度（例如，從驅出羯磨減為呵責羯磨）。不過，如果他們有正當理由施行羯磨，他不應該在僧團集會進行中提出反對。一旦羯磨完成，他就應該專注於幫助他的依止師遵從僧團決議守規矩，以便他們盡快解除羯磨。</td>

<tr><td><em>3. Washing, making, and dyeing the mentor’s robes.</em></td>

<tr><td>a. The pupil should neither give nor receive gifts, nor give or receive services to/from others without first obtaining the mentor’s permission. According to the Commentary, <em>others</em> here means people who are on bad terms with the mentor.</td>
<td>a. 未得到依止師的允許之前，弟子不應贈送物品給他人，或接受他人贈送的物品，亦不應奉事他人或接受他人的奉事。根據《義註》，這裡的「他人」意指：與依止師關係不睦的人。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>b. The pupil should obtain his mentor’s permission before entering a village, going to a cemetery (to meditate, says, the Commentary), or leaving the district in which they live. The Commentary notes, though, that if the mentor refuses one’s request the first time, one should ask up to two more times, presenting one’s reasons as best one can. If the mentor still refuses, the pupil should reflect on his situation. If staying with the mentor is not helping his education and meditation, and if the mentor seems to want him to stay simply to have someone to look after his (the mentor’s) needs, the pupil is justified in leaving and taking dependence with a new mentor in his new residence.</td>
<td>b. 弟子必須得到依止師的允許之後，才能入村莊、入墓地（《義註》說：去修行）或離開共住的區域。然而，《義註》指出：如果依止師拒絕弟子第一次的請求，弟子應當再請求最多兩次，並儘可能地陳述自己的理由。如果依止師仍然拒絕，弟子應反思自己的情況，如果繼續與依止師共住對自己的教育與修行沒有幫助，而依止師要弟子留下似乎只是因為需要人奉事，如此，弟子有正當理由離開，並在新住處依止新的依止師。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, a pupil is freed from these duties when he is ill. Otherwise, he should observe all the above duties to his preceptor as long as he is in dependence on him. It adds that the duties in sections 1-3 are incumbent on the pupil even after he is released from dependence, as long as both he and the preceptor are alive and still ordained, although not every Community follows the Commentary on this point.</td>
<td>根據《義註》，弟子生病時可以免除這些職責。否則，只要他依止戒師，他就應該履行對戒師的所有上述職責。它補充說，即使在弟子免除依止之後，只要他和戒師都活著並且仍然是比丘身分，第 1-3 節中的職責也是弟子必須履行的，儘管並非每個僧團都在這一點上遵循《義註》。</td>

<tr><td>As for the duties to one’s teacher, the Commentary lists four types of teachers: the going-forth teacher (the one who gives one the ten precepts during one’s ordination ceremony); the acceptance teacher (the one who chants the motion and proclamations during the ceremony); the Dhamma teacher (the one who teaches one the Pali language and Canon); and the dependence teacher (the one with whom one lives in dependence). With the dependence teacher and Dhamma teacher, one must observe all the above duties only as long as one is living in dependence on him. As for the other two, the Commentary adds that one should observe sections 1-3 as long as both parties are alive and still ordained—although, again, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point.</td>
<td>至於對教授師的職責，《義註》列舉了四種教授師：出家教授師（受具足戒儀式中，授與十戒者）；羯磨教授師（受具足戒儀式中，宣讀白四羯磨文者）；佛法教授師（教授巴利語和《聖典》者）；以及依止教授師（依止共住者）。對於依止教授師和佛法教授師，只有當弟子依止共住時，才必須履行所有上述職責。至於另外兩者，《義註》補充說，只要雙方都活著並且仍然是比丘身分，就應該履行第 1-3 節——儘管並非所有僧團都在這一點上遵循《義註》。<!-- https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E9%97%8D%E9%BB%8E

（五）依止阿闍梨，與出家僧人共居，指導其起居之師，出家僧人僅依止一宿，共同起居時的老師，即可稱之。又稱依止阿闍梨、依止師，也可稱為和尚[1]。

三師七證

三師與七證師之並稱。指比丘受具足戒時，戒場中必須具足之戒師人數。又作十師、十僧。三師即：(一)戒和尚，指正授戒律之和尚。乃比丘得戒之根本及其歸投處，故必至誠三請之。凡擔任戒和尚者，其戒臘須在十年以上，並嚴守戒法，具足智慧，堪能教授弟子。(二)羯磨師，即讀羯磨文之阿闍梨，主持白四羯磨授戒儀式。羯磨師為諸比丘受戒之正緣，若無羯磨師秉承聖法，則法界善法無從生起。擔任此職者，其戒臘須在五年以上。(三)教授師，即教授威儀作法，為眾人引導開解者。其戒臘亦須在五年以上。七證師則指證明受戒之七位蒞會比丘。凡此十師均須於受戒前恭請之。
在印度、中國，佛教較盛行而人口較稠密的「中國」地區，因其僧眾極多，故有十師之規定，至於「邊國」地區則僅須有三師二證等五師即可，此稱為「中十邊五」。然據雲雨鈔載，日本雖為海東之邊國，卻行「中國」之十師受戒之法。故日本之東大寺及唐招提寺戒壇，自古即行十師受戒之法。又受五戒時僅須和尚一人，受十戒時則須和尚、羯磨師二人即可。此外，湛然之授菩薩戒儀舉出，大乘菩薩戒之請師法，則異於上述四分律所說。即以釋迦如來為和尚，文殊為羯磨師，彌勒為教授師，一切如來為尊證師，一切菩薩為同學等侶；事實上擔任教授者，唯有傳教師一人。〔毘尼母經卷一、四分律卷三十一、五分律卷十七、摩訶僧祇律卷二十四〕（參閱「中國」1023） p595 -->

<tr><td>A bhikkhu on a journey is said to have no mentor available if no qualified senior bhikkhu is traveling with him. In other words, the fact that he happens to pass by a monastery containing a qualified mentor does not mean that a mentor is available, and he is allowed to continue traveling without taking dependence. If, however, he spends the night in a place where he has taken dependence before, he should take dependence on the day of his arrival. If he reaches a place where he has never been before and plans to spend only two or three days, he need not take dependence; but if he plans to spend a week, he must. If the senior bhikkhu he requests dependence from says, “What’s the use of taking dependence for only a week?” that exempts him from this requirement.</td>
<td>比丘在旅途中，如果沒有合格的長老比丘與之同行，稱為沒有依止師。換句話說，他碰巧經過有一位合格的依止師的寺院，這並不意味著有依止師，他可以繼續旅行而無需依止。然而，如果他在以前已經依止的地方過夜，他應該在到達的那天開始依止。如果他到了一個從未去過的地方，只打算待兩三天，就不必依止；但如果他打算待一周，他就必須依止。如果他請求依止的長老比丘說：“只依止一周有什麼用呢？” 這使他免除依止的要求。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the bhikkhu living alone in the wilderness, the Commentary says that “meditating comfortably” means that his tranquility and insight meditation are going smoothly. For some reason, though, it says that this allowance applies only to bhikkhus whose meditation is at a tender stage and might deteriorate if they were to leave the wilderness; if a bhikkhu has attained any of the noble attainments—beginning with stream-entry—he may not make use of this allowance. Why the Commentary limits the allowance in this way, it doesn’t say.</td>
<td>對於獨居森林的比丘，《義註》說，「修行得很安穩」是指他的止觀禪修進行得順利。然而，出於某種原因，它說這項開緣只適用於禪修處於幼嫩階段的比丘，如果離開森林，禪修可能會惡化。如果比丘已經證得任何聖果－從入流開始－他就不能使用這項開緣。《義註》並沒有說為何如此限制開緣的理由。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, once the month before the Rains-residence (<em>vassa</em>) arrives and no suitable mentor appears, the junior bhikkhu must leave his wilderness abode and look for a place with a suitable mentor under whom he can take dependence for the Rains.</td>
<td>無論如何，一旦到了雨安居（<em>vassa</em>）前的那一個月，沒有合適的依止師出現，低戒臘比丘就必須離開他的森林住所，尋找一個有合適依止師的地方，他可以在雨安居時依止之。</td>

<tr><td>According to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html#Mv.I.53.4">Mv.I.53.4</a>, a bhikkhu may be released from dependence after he has been ordained for five years, on the condition that he be experienced and competent. If he is not yet experienced and competent, he must remain under dependency until he is. If he never becomes experienced and competent, he must remain in dependence for his entire life as a bhikkhu. The Commentary adds that, in the last case, if he cannot find a competent experienced bhikkhu who is senior to him, he must take dependence with a competent, experienced bhikkhu who is his junior.</td>
<td>根據<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0100a02">《大品》.一.53.4</a>，受具足戒五年後，比丘可以解除依止，條件是他必須賢能通達。如果他還沒有賢能通達，他就必須保持依止，直到他賢能通達。如果他一直無法變得賢能通達，他作為比丘的一生就必須保持依止。《義註》補充說，必須終身依止的比丘，如果找不到賢能通達的上座比丘，他就必須依止賢能通達的下座比丘。</td>

<tr><td>To be considered competent and experienced enough to deserve release from dependence, a bhikkhu must meet many of the same general qualifications as those for a mentor, except that he need not possess the competence to look after a pupil, and the minimum number of years he needs as a bhikkhu is five. None of the texts divide the qualifications here into ideal and minimal qualifications, as they do for the mentor, but it seems reasonable that the same division would apply here as well. This would give us the following list:</td>
<td>為了被認為有足夠的賢能通達，得以解除依止，比丘必須滿足許多與依止師相同的一般資格，除了他不需要具備照顧弟子的能力，以及做為比丘最少五年。沒有任何文本像依止師一樣，將這裡的資格分為理想資格和最低資格，但同樣的劃分也適用於這裡似乎是合理的。於是我們得以條列如下文：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The ideal qualifications:</em> The bhikkhu should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release. He should have faith, a sense of shame, compunction, persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness. He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and possess right view.</td>
<td><em>理想資格：</em>比丘應具備阿羅漢的戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見。他應該有信心、慚、愧、精進、不失正念。他應無重、輕諸罪，並且具足正見。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The minimal qualifications:</em> The bhikkhu must be learned and intelligent, knowing both Pāṭimokkhas in detail, understanding what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for at least five years (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html#Mv.I.53.5-9">Mv.I.53.5-13</a>).</td>
<td><em>最低資格：</em>比庫必須博學且聰慧，嫻熟通達二部《波羅提木叉》，了解什麼是犯戒，什麼是不犯戒，什麼是輕罪，什麼是重罪，以及如何懺罪。而且──最基本的要求──他必須受具足戒為比丘至少五年（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0100a06">《大品》.一.53.5-13</a>）。</td>
