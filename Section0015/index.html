Using the Great Standards, the Council of Elders in Thailand has recently decided that stainless steel bowls are allowable—because, after all, they are steel—but aluminum bowls not, because they share some of the dangers of tin.

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga contains a discussion of three proper sizes for a bowl—the medium size containing twice the volume of the small, and the large twice the volume of the medium—but they are based on measurements that are not known with any precision at present. The author of the Vinaya-mukha reports having experimented with various sizes of bowls based on a passage in the story of Meṇḍaka in the Dhammapada Commentary. His conclusion: A small bowl is just a little larger than a human skull, and a medium bowl approximately 27 1/2 English inches (70 cm.) in circumference, or about 8.75 inches (22.5 cm.) in diameter. He did not try making a large bowl. Any size larger than the large size or smaller than the small is inappropriate; any size between them falls under this rule.</td>

Because stainless steel does not rust it need not be fired, but a popular practice is to find some way to make it gray—either by painting it on the outside or firing the whole bowl with leaves that will give it a smoky color—so that it will not stand out.</td>
<td>《義註》指出，黏土缽（陶缽）必須燒製兩次才能決意，以確保其適當硬化；鐵缽五次，防止生鏽。因為不銹鋼不會生鏽，所以不需要燒製，但一種流行的做法是找到某種方法使其變灰色——若非在外面塗漆，不然就是用葉子燒製整個缽，使其呈現煙燻色——這樣它就不會顯眼突出。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to the following rule says that a bhikkhu may ask for a new bowl if his current bowl has five mends or more, the space for a mend (§) being two inches (fingerbreadths). The Commentary explains this first by saying that a bowl with five mends or more is damaged beyond repair, and thus loses its determination as a bowl. It then expands on the Vibhaṅga’s statements as follows: A clay bowl is damaged beyond repair if it has at least ten inches of cracks in it, the smallest of the cracks being at least two inches long. Cracks less than two inches long are said not to merit mending—this is the meaning of the Vibhaṅga’s phrase, “space for a mend”—and so do not count. As the K/Commentary notes, whether the cracks are actually mended is not an issue here. If a bowl has fewer cracks than that, they should be mended either with tin wire, sap (but for some reason not pure pine sap), or a mixture of sugar cane syrup and powdered stone. Other materials not to be used for repair are beeswax and sealing wax. If the total length of countable cracks equals ten inches or more, the bowl becomes a non-bowl, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one.</td>
<td>下一條戒條的《經分別》指出，如果比丘目前的缽有五處修補或更多，則比丘可以要求一個新缽，而修補的空間（§）為兩英寸（指寬）。《義註》首先解釋說，缽修補五次以上，就已經損壞到無法修復的程度，從而失去了其決意為缽。然後，它對《經分別》的敘述進行了如下擴展：如果一個粘土缽（陶缽）上有至少十英寸的裂縫，其中最小的裂縫至少有兩英寸長，那麼它就被損壞到無法修復的程度。小於兩英寸長的裂縫據說不值得修補——這就是《經分別》的措辭「用來修補的空間」的含義——所以不算數。正如 K/《義註》所指出的，裂縫是否真正得到修補在此並不是問題。如果缽的裂縫比那少，則應使用錫絲、樹液（但由於某種原因不是純松樹液）或甘蔗糖漿和石粉的混合物來修補。其他不能用於修復的材料是蜂蠟和密封蠟。如果可數裂縫的總長度等於或超過十英寸，則該缽就不再是缽，主人有權要求換一個新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for iron and steel bowls, a hole in the bowl large enough to let a millet grain pass through is enough to make the determination lapse, but not enough to make the bowl a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should plug the hole—or have a blacksmith plug it—with powdered metal or a tiny metal plug polished smooth with the surface of the bowl and then re-determine the bowl for use.</td>
<td>對於鐵缽、不銹鋼缽來說，缽上有一個足以讓一粒小米粒通過的孔，足以使決意失效，但不足以使該缽成為非缽。比丘應該用金屬粉末或與缽表面打磨光滑的小金屬塞塞住這個洞，或者請鐵匠塞住，然後重新決意缽來使用。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the hole is small enough to be plugged in this way, then no matter how many such holes there are in the bowl they do not make it a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should mend it and continue using it. If, however, there is even one hole so large that the metal used to plug it cannot be polished smooth with the surface of the rest of the bowl, the tiny crevices in the patch will collect food. This makes it unfit for use, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one to replace it.</td>
<td>如果這個洞夠小，可以用這種方式堵住，那麼無論缽裡有多少個這樣的洞，都不會使它成為一個非缽。比丘應該修補它並繼續使用它。然而，即使只有一個孔太大，以至於用於堵塞它的金屬無法與缽其餘部分的表面拋光光滑，修補片上的微小縫隙就會積聚食物。這將導致其不適合使用，所有者有權要求更換新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>An extra alms bowl, according to the Vibhaṅga, is any that has not yet been determined for use or placed under shared ownership. Because a bhikkhu may have only one bowl determined for use at any one time, he should place any additional bowls he receives under shared ownership if he plans to keep them on hand. (The procedures for placing bowls under determination and shared ownership, and for rescinding their determination and shared ownership, are given in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">Appendices IV</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">V</a>.)</td>
<td>根據《經分別》，額外的缽是指尚未決意使用或置於共享所有權之下的任何缽。因為比丘在任何時候只可以有一個缽決意使用，所以如果他打算將收到的任何額外的缽放在手邊，他應該將它們置於共享所有權之下。（將缽決意和置於共享所有權之下以及撤銷其決意和共享所有權的程序參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">附錄四</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">五</a>。）</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, once a bowl belonging to a bhikkhu fulfills all the requirements for a determinable bowl, he is responsible for it even if he has not yet received it into his keeping—in other words, the countdown on the time span begins. For example, if a blacksmith promises to make him a bowl and to send word when it is finished, the bhikkhu is responsible for the bowl as soon as he hears word from the blacksmith’s messenger that the bowl is ready, even if he has yet to receive it. If the blacksmith, prior to making the bowl, promises to send it when it is done, then the bhikkhu is not responsible for it until the blacksmith’s messenger brings it to him. (All of this assumes that the bowl is already fully paid for.)</td>
<td>根據《義註》，一旦比丘擁有的缽滿足了可決意缽的所有要求，即使他還沒有收到它，他也要對它負責——換句話說，時間跨度開始倒數。例如，如果鐵匠答應為他製作一個缽，並在完成後通知他，一旦比丘聽到鐵匠的使者說缽已準備好，他就要對缽負責，即使他還沒有收到它。如果鐵匠在製作缽之前承諾完成後將其送出，那麼在鐵匠的使者將缽帶給比丘之前，比丘不對此負責。（所有這些都假設缽已經全額付款。）</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if within ten days after receiving a new bowl a bhikkhu does not determine it for use, place it under shared ownership, abandon it (give it or throw it away); and if the bowl is not lost, snatched away, damaged beyond repair, or taken on trust, then on the tenth dawnrise after receiving it he incurs the full penalty under this rule. If he then uses the bowl without having forfeited it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《經分別》規定，如果比丘在收到新缽後十天內不決意它來使用，置於共享所有權之下，放棄它（給予或扔掉）；而且如果缽沒有遺失、被搶走、損壞到無法修復或被基於信任拿走，那麼在收到缽後的第十天黎明時，根據本戒條他將承擔全部懲罰。如果他隨後使用了缽而沒有捨出它，則懲罰是《突吉羅》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Perception is not a mitigating factor here. Even if the bhikkhu thinks that ten days have not passed when they have, or if he thinks that the bowl is damaged beyond repair or placed under shared ownership, etc., when it isn’t, he incurs the penalty all the same.</td>
<td>在這裡，感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素。即使比丘認為十天還沒過，但實際上已經過十天了，或認為缽已損壞無法修復或置於共享所有權之下，但事實並非如此，他仍然會受到懲罰。</td>

As with all Community officials, the bowl exchanger must be free of the four types of bias: based on desire, based on aversion, based on delusion, based on fear. He must also know when a bowl is properly exchanged and when it’s not. His duty, once authorized, is to take the forfeited bowl and show it to the most senior bhikkhu, who is to choose whichever of the two bowls pleases him more—his own or the new one. If the new bowl is preferable to his own and yet he does not take it out of sympathy for the offender, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The K/Commentary and Sub-commentary add that if he does not prefer the new bowl, there is no offense in not taking it. The Commentary states that if he does prefer the new bowl but, out of a desire to develop the virtue of contentment with what he has, decides not to take it, there is also no offense.</td>

<td>繼續講《經分別》：一旦戒臘最高的比丘做出了選擇，剩下的缽就會呈給戒臘第二高的比丘，重複這個過程，依此類推，依次遞給戒臘最低的比丘。然後，缽交換者將最後一位比丘選擇的剩餘缽——屬於比丘同伴們最不合意的缽——交給犯戒者，告訴他決意來使用並盡其所能地照料它，直到它不可用為止。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td><em>Fresh butter</em> must be made from the milk of any animal whose flesh is allowable. None of the Vinaya texts go into detail on how fresh butter is made, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN126.html">MN 126</a> describes the process as “having sprinkled curds in a pot, one twirls them with a churn.” Fresh butter of this sort is still made in India today by taking a small churn—looking like an orange with alternate sections removed, attached to a small stick—and twirling it in curds, all the while sprinkling them with water. The fresh butter—mostly milk fat—coagulates on the churn, and when the fresh butter is removed, what is left in the pot is diluted buttermilk. Fresh butter, unlike creamery butter made by churning cream, may be stored unrefrigerated in bottles for several days even in the heat of India without going rancid.</td>
<td>新鮮奶油必須由任何允許食用其肉的動物的奶製成。律藏文獻中沒有詳細介紹如何製作新鮮奶油，但<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/126.html">《中部》126經</a>將這一過程描述為「將凝乳撒在鍋中，然後用攪拌器旋轉它們」。如今，這種新鮮奶油在印度仍然是通過取一個小攪拌器（看起來像一個被去除了交替部分的橙子，連接到一根小棍子上）並將其與凝乳一起旋轉，同時在凝乳中撒上水來製作的。新鮮奶油（主要是乳脂）在攪拌器上凝固，當新鮮奶油被取出時，鍋中剩下的就是稀釋的酪乳。與攪拌奶油製成的乳清奶油不同，新鮮奶油即使在印度炎熱的天氣下也可以在不冷藏的情況下在瓶子中保存幾天而不會變質。</td>

Apparently, cheese—curds heated to evaporate their liquid content and then cured with or without mold—was unknown in those days, but there seems every reason, using the Great Standards, to include it under one of the five. The question is which one. Some have argued that it should come under fresh butter, but the argument for classifying it under curds seems stronger, as it is closer to curds in composition and is generally regarded as more of a substantial food. Different Communities, however, have differing opinions on this matter.</td>

<tr><td><em>Oil</em>, according to the Vibhaṅga, includes sesame oil, mustard seed oil, “honey tree” oil, castor oil, and oil from tallow. The Commentary adds that oil made from any plants not listed in the Vibhaṅga carries a dukkaṭa if kept more than seven days, although it would seem preferable to use the Great Standards and simply apply the full offense under this rule to all plant oils that can be used as food; and to class as medicines (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#BMC2chapter5">BMC2, Chapter 5</a>) any aromatic plant oils—such as tea-tree oil or peppermint oil—made from leaves or resins that qualify as medicines that can be kept for life.</td>

Because human flesh, if eaten, carries a thullaccaya, oil from human fat is not allowed.</td>

(The PTS and Thai editions of the Canon use the word <em>saṁsaṭṭha</em> here, which usually means “mixed together”; the Sri Lankan edition reads <em>saṁsatta</em>, or “hung together.” Whichever the reading, the Commentary states that the meaning here is “filtered,” which best fits the context.) According to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/Mv/MvVI.html#pts2_2">Mv.VI.2.2</a>, if the tallow has been received, rendered, or filtered after noon, the act of consuming the resulting oil carries a dukkaṭa for each of the three activities that took place after noon. For example, if the tallow was received before noon but rendered and filtered after noon, there are two dukkaṭas for consuming the resulting oil.</td>

<tr><td>Whether the Great Standards can be used to include gelatin under the category of “oil” here is a controversial topic. The argument for including it is that, like oil from tallow, it is rendered from a part of an animal’s body that the Commentary would include under “flesh,” and—on its own—it does not serve as substantial food. Different Communities, however, have differing opinions on this matter.</td>
<td>是否可以依照《四大教示》將<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E8%86%A0">明膠</a>納入「油」範疇，這是一個有爭議的議題。支持將其包括在內的論點是，就像來自動物脂中的油一樣，它是從動物身體的一部分提煉出來的，《義註》將其納入「肉」中，並且它本身並不能作為大量的食物。然而，不同的僧團對此問題有不同的看法。</td>

<tr><td><em>Honey</em> means the honey of bees, although the Commentary lists two species of bee—<em>cirika</em>, long and with wings, and <em>tumbala</em>, large, black and with hard wings—whose honey it says is very viscous and ranks as a medicine, not as one of the five tonics.</td>
<td>蜂蜜的意思是蜜蜂的蜂蜜，儘管《義註》列出了兩種蜜蜂—— <em>cirika</em> ，長且有翅膀，和 <em>tumbala</em> ，大，黑色，翅膀堅硬——它說它們的蜂蜜非常黏稠，可以作為藥物，而不是作為五種補品之一。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Sugar/molasses</em> the Vibhaṅga defines simply as what is extracted from sugar cane. The Commentary interprets this as meaning not only sugar and molasses, but also fresh sugar cane juice, but this contradicts <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.35.6">Mv.VI.35.6</a>, which classes fresh sugar cane juice as a juice drink, not a tonic. The Commentary also says that sugar or molasses made from any fruit classed as a food—such as coconut or date palm—ranks as a food and not as a tonic, but it is hard to guess at its reasoning here, as sugar cane itself is also classed as a food. The Vinaya-mukha seems more correct in using the Great Standards to say that all forms of sugar and molasses, no matter what the source, would be included here. Thus maple syrup and beet-sugar would come under this rule.</td>
<td><em>糖/糖蜜</em>，《經分別》僅將其定義為從甘蔗中提取的物質。《義註》將其解釋為不僅指糖和糖蜜，還指新鮮甘蔗汁，但這與<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0323a01">《大品》.六.35.6</a>相矛盾，後者將新鮮甘蔗汁歸類為果汁飲料，而不是補品。《義註》還說，由任何被歸類為食物的水果（例如椰子或椰棗）製成的糖或糖蜜都屬於食物，而不是補品，但很難猜測其原因，因為甘蔗本身就是也被歸類為食物。《戒律入口》似乎更正確地使用《四大教示》來說所有形式的糖和糖蜜，無論來源是什麼，都包括在這裡。因此，楓糖漿和甜菜糖算在本戒條之下。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha—arguing from the parallel between sugar cane juice, which is a juice drink, and sugar, which is made by boiling sugar cane juice—maintains that boiled juice would fit under sugar here. This opinion, however, is not accepted in all Communities.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》——從甘蔗汁（一種果汁飲料）和糖（通過煮沸甘蔗汁製成）之間的相似性出發——認為煮沸的果汁可以算在此處的糖之下。然而，這項意見並未被所有僧團接受。</td>

<tr><td>According to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.16.1">Mv.VI.16.1</a>, even if the sugar has a little flour mixed in with it simply to make it firmer—as sometimes happens in sugar cubes and blocks of palm sugar—it is still classed as a tonic as long as it is still regarded simply as “sugar.” If the mixture is regarded as something else—candy, for instance—it counts as a food and may not be eaten after noon of the day on which it is received.</td>
<td>根據<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0279a10">《大品》.六.16.1</a>，即使糖中混有少量麵粉，只是為了使其更堅硬（有時會發生在方糖和棕櫚糖塊中），只要它仍然僅被視為「糖」，它仍然被歸類為補品。如果混合物被視為其他東西（例如糖果），則它被視為食物，並且在接受的當天中午之後不得食用。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Sugar substitutes that have no food value would apparently not be classed as a food or a tonic, and thus would come under the category of life-long medicines.</td>
