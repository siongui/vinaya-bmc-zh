Using the Great Standards, the Council of Elders in Thailand has recently decided that stainless steel bowls are allowable—because, after all, they are steel—but aluminum bowls not, because they share some of the dangers of tin.

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga contains a discussion of three proper sizes for a bowl—the medium size containing twice the volume of the small, and the large twice the volume of the medium—but they are based on measurements that are not known with any precision at present. The author of the Vinaya-mukha reports having experimented with various sizes of bowls based on a passage in the story of Meṇḍaka in the Dhammapada Commentary. His conclusion: A small bowl is just a little larger than a human skull, and a medium bowl approximately 27 1/2 English inches (70 cm.) in circumference, or about 8.75 inches (22.5 cm.) in diameter. He did not try making a large bowl. Any size larger than the large size or smaller than the small is inappropriate; any size between them falls under this rule.</td>

Because stainless steel does not rust it need not be fired, but a popular practice is to find some way to make it gray—either by painting it on the outside or firing the whole bowl with leaves that will give it a smoky color—so that it will not stand out.</td>
<td>《義註》指出，黏土缽（陶缽）必須燒製兩次才能決意，以確保其適當硬化；鐵缽五次，防止生鏽。因為不銹鋼不會生鏽，所以不需要燒製，但一種流行的做法是找到某種方法使其變灰色——若非在外面塗漆，不然就是用葉子燒製整個缽，使其呈現煙燻色——這樣它就不會顯眼突出。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to the following rule says that a bhikkhu may ask for a new bowl if his current bowl has five mends or more, the space for a mend (§) being two inches (fingerbreadths). The Commentary explains this first by saying that a bowl with five mends or more is damaged beyond repair, and thus loses its determination as a bowl. It then expands on the Vibhaṅga’s statements as follows: A clay bowl is damaged beyond repair if it has at least ten inches of cracks in it, the smallest of the cracks being at least two inches long. Cracks less than two inches long are said not to merit mending—this is the meaning of the Vibhaṅga’s phrase, “space for a mend”—and so do not count. As the K/Commentary notes, whether the cracks are actually mended is not an issue here. If a bowl has fewer cracks than that, they should be mended either with tin wire, sap (but for some reason not pure pine sap), or a mixture of sugar cane syrup and powdered stone. Other materials not to be used for repair are beeswax and sealing wax. If the total length of countable cracks equals ten inches or more, the bowl becomes a non-bowl, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one.</td>
<td>下一條戒條的《經分別》指出，如果比丘目前的缽有五處修補或更多，則比丘可以要求一個新缽，而修補的空間（§）為兩英寸（指寬）。《義註》首先解釋說，缽修補五次以上，就已經損壞到無法修復的程度，從而失去了其決意為缽。然後，它對《經分別》的敘述進行了如下擴展：如果一個粘土缽（陶缽）上有至少十英寸的裂縫，其中最小的裂縫至少有兩英寸長，那麼它就被損壞到無法修復的程度。小於兩英寸長的裂縫據說不值得修補——這就是《經分別》的措辭「用來修補的空間」的含義——所以不算數。正如 K/《義註》所指出的，裂縫是否真正得到修補在此並不是問題。如果缽的裂縫比那少，則應使用錫絲、樹液（但由於某種原因不是純松樹液）或甘蔗糖漿和石粉的混合物來修補。其他不能用於修復的材料是蜂蠟和密封蠟。如果可數裂縫的總長度等於或超過十英寸，則該缽就不再是缽，主人有權要求換一個新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for iron and steel bowls, a hole in the bowl large enough to let a millet grain pass through is enough to make the determination lapse, but not enough to make the bowl a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should plug the hole—or have a blacksmith plug it—with powdered metal or a tiny metal plug polished smooth with the surface of the bowl and then re-determine the bowl for use.</td>
<td>對於鐵缽、不銹鋼缽來說，缽上有一個足以讓一粒小米粒通過的孔，足以使決意失效，但不足以使該缽成為非缽。比丘應該用金屬粉末或與缽表面打磨光滑的小金屬塞塞住這個洞，或者請鐵匠塞住，然後重新決意缽來使用。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the hole is small enough to be plugged in this way, then no matter how many such holes there are in the bowl they do not make it a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should mend it and continue using it. If, however, there is even one hole so large that the metal used to plug it cannot be polished smooth with the surface of the rest of the bowl, the tiny crevices in the patch will collect food. This makes it unfit for use, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one to replace it.</td>
<td>如果這個洞夠小，可以用這種方式堵住，那麼無論缽裡有多少個這樣的洞，都不會使它成為一個非缽。比丘應該修補它並繼續使用它。然而，即使只有一個孔太大，以至於用於堵塞它的金屬無法與缽其餘部分的表面拋光光滑，修補片上的微小縫隙就會積聚食物。這將導致其不適合使用，所有者有權要求更換新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>An extra alms bowl, according to the Vibhaṅga, is any that has not yet been determined for use or placed under shared ownership. Because a bhikkhu may have only one bowl determined for use at any one time, he should place any additional bowls he receives under shared ownership if he plans to keep them on hand. (The procedures for placing bowls under determination and shared ownership, and for rescinding their determination and shared ownership, are given in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">Appendices IV</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">V</a>.)</td>
<td>根據《經分別》，額外的缽是指尚未決意使用或置於共享所有權之下的任何缽。因為比丘在任何時候只可以有一個缽決意使用，所以如果他打算將收到的任何額外的缽放在手邊，他應該將它們置於共享所有權之下。（將缽決意和置於共享所有權之下以及撤銷其決意和共享所有權的程序參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">附錄四</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">五</a>。）</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, once a bowl belonging to a bhikkhu fulfills all the requirements for a determinable bowl, he is responsible for it even if he has not yet received it into his keeping—in other words, the countdown on the time span begins. For example, if a blacksmith promises to make him a bowl and to send word when it is finished, the bhikkhu is responsible for the bowl as soon as he hears word from the blacksmith’s messenger that the bowl is ready, even if he has yet to receive it. If the blacksmith, prior to making the bowl, promises to send it when it is done, then the bhikkhu is not responsible for it until the blacksmith’s messenger brings it to him. (All of this assumes that the bowl is already fully paid for.)</td>
<td>根據《義註》，一旦比丘擁有的缽滿足了可決意缽的所有要求，即使他還沒有收到它，他也要對它負責——換句話說，時間跨度開始倒數。例如，如果鐵匠答應為他製作一個缽，並在完成後通知他，一旦比丘聽到鐵匠的使者說缽已準備好，他就要對缽負責，即使他還沒有收到它。如果鐵匠在製作缽之前承諾完成後將其送出，那麼在鐵匠的使者將缽帶給比丘之前，比丘不對此負責。（所有這些都假設缽已經全額付款。）</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if within ten days after receiving a new bowl a bhikkhu does not determine it for use, place it under shared ownership, abandon it (give it or throw it away); and if the bowl is not lost, snatched away, damaged beyond repair, or taken on trust, then on the tenth dawnrise after receiving it he incurs the full penalty under this rule. If he then uses the bowl without having forfeited it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《經分別》規定，如果比丘在收到新缽後十天內不決意它來使用，置於共享所有權之下，放棄它（給予或扔掉）；而且如果缽沒有遺失、被搶走、損壞到無法修復或被基於信任拿走，那麼在收到缽後的第十天黎明時，根據本戒條他將承擔全部懲罰。如果他隨後使用了缽而沒有捨出它，則懲罰是《突吉羅》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Perception is not a mitigating factor here. Even if the bhikkhu thinks that ten days have not passed when they have, or if he thinks that the bowl is damaged beyond repair or placed under shared ownership, etc., when it isn’t, he incurs the penalty all the same.</td>
<td>在這裡，感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素。即使比丘認為十天還沒過，但實際上已經過十天了，或認為缽已損壞無法修復或置於共享所有權之下，但事實並非如此，他仍然會受到懲罰。</td>

As with all Community officials, the bowl exchanger must be free of the four types of bias: based on desire, based on aversion, based on delusion, based on fear. He must also know when a bowl is properly exchanged and when it’s not. His duty, once authorized, is to take the forfeited bowl and show it to the most senior bhikkhu, who is to choose whichever of the two bowls pleases him more—his own or the new one. If the new bowl is preferable to his own and yet he does not take it out of sympathy for the offender, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The K/Commentary and Sub-commentary add that if he does not prefer the new bowl, there is no offense in not taking it. The Commentary states that if he does prefer the new bowl but, out of a desire to develop the virtue of contentment with what he has, decides not to take it, there is also no offense.</td>

<tr><td><em>Fresh butter</em> must be made from the milk of any animal whose flesh is allowable. None of the Vinaya texts go into detail on how fresh butter is made, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN126.html">MN 126</a> describes the process as “having sprinkled curds in a pot, one twirls them with a churn.” Fresh butter of this sort is still made in India today by taking a small churn—looking like an orange with alternate sections removed, attached to a small stick—and twirling it in curds, all the while sprinkling them with water. The fresh butter—mostly milk fat—coagulates on the churn, and when the fresh butter is removed, what is left in the pot is diluted buttermilk. Fresh butter, unlike creamery butter made by churning cream, may be stored unrefrigerated in bottles for several days even in the heat of India without going rancid.</td>
<td>新鮮奶油必須由任何允許食用其肉的動物的奶製成。律藏文獻中沒有詳細介紹如何製作新鮮奶油，但<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/126.html">《中部》126經</a>將這一過程描述為「將凝乳撒在鍋中，然後用攪拌器旋轉它們」。如今，這種新鮮奶油在印度仍然是通過取一個小攪拌器（看起來像一個被去除了交替部分的橙子，連接到一根小棍子上）並將其與凝乳一起旋轉，同時在凝乳中撒上水來製作的。新鮮奶油（主要是乳脂）在攪拌器上凝固，當新鮮奶油被取出時，鍋中剩下的就是稀釋的酪乳。與攪拌奶油製成的乳清奶油不同，新鮮奶油即使在印度炎熱的天氣下也可以在不冷藏的情況下在瓶子中保存幾天而不會變質。</td>

Apparently, cheese—curds heated to evaporate their liquid content and then cured with or without mold—was unknown in those days, but there seems every reason, using the Great Standards, to include it under one of the five. The question is which one. Some have argued that it should come under fresh butter, but the argument for classifying it under curds seems stronger, as it is closer to curds in composition and is generally regarded as more of a substantial food.

(The PTS and Thai editions of the Canon use the word <em>saṁsaṭṭha</em> here, which usually means “mixed together”; the Sri Lankan edition reads <em>saṁsatta</em>, or “hung together.” Whichever the reading, the Commentary states that the meaning here is “filtered,” which best fits the context.) According to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/Mv/MvVI.html#pts2_2">Mv.VI.2.2</a>, if the tallow has been received, rendered, or filtered after noon, the act of consuming the resulting oil carries a dukkaṭa for each of the three activities that took place after noon.

<tr><td>Whether the Great Standards can be used to include gelatin under the category of “oil” here is a controversial topic.

The Commentary also says that sugar or molasses made from any fruit classed as a food—such as coconut or date palm—ranks as a food and not as a tonic, but it is hard to guess at its reasoning here, as sugar cane itself is also classed as a food. The Vinaya-mukha seems more correct in using the Great Standards to say that all forms of sugar and molasses, no matter what the source, would be included here. Thus maple syrup and beet-sugar would come under this rule.</td>
<td><em>糖/糖蜜</em>，《經分別》僅將其定義為從甘蔗中提取的物質。《義註》將其解釋為不僅指糖和糖蜜，還指新鮮甘蔗汁，但這與<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0323a01">《大品》.六.35.6</a>相矛盾，後者將新鮮甘蔗汁歸類為果汁飲料，而不是補品。《義註》還說，由任何被歸類為食物的水果（例如椰子或椰棗）製成的糖或糖蜜都屬於食物，而不是補品，但很難猜測其原因，因為甘蔗本身就是也被歸類為食物。《戒律入口》似乎更正確地使用《四大教示》來說所有形式的糖和糖蜜，無論來源是什麼，都包括在這裡。因此，楓糖漿和甜菜糖算在本戒條之下。</td>

2) Unlike the other rules dealing with robe-cloth or bowls kept <em>x</em> number of days, the non-offense clauses here do not include exemptions for tonics placed under shared ownership, but the Commentary discusses <em>abandons it</em> as if it read “places it under shared ownership.” Its verdict: Any tonic placed under shared ownership may be kept for more than seven days without incurring a penalty as long as the owners do not divide up their shares, but after the seventh day they may not use it for internal purposes. The Sub-commentary adds that any tonic placed under shared ownership may not be used at all until the arrangement is rescinded.</div>

3) The Commentary reports a controversy between two Vinaya experts on the meaning of the last exemption in the list—i.e., “having given it away to an unordained person, abandoning possession of it in his mind, he receives it in return and makes use of it.” Ven. Mahā Sumanatthera states that the phrase, “if within seven days” applies here as well: If within seven days the bhikkhu gives the tonic to an unordained person, having abandoned possession of it in his mind, he may then keep it and consume it for another seven days if the unordained person happens to return it to him.</div>
</td>
<td><div class="mx-2 first last docutils container">
3）《義註》記述了兩位戒律專家之間關於列表中最後一項豁免的含義的爭議，即「將它給予未受具足戒的人，在心中放棄了對它的擁有，他收到它作為回報並使用它」。摩訶Sumanatthera尊者指出，該措辭「若在七日內」也適用於此：如果在七日內，比丘將補品給予一位未受具足戒的人，並在心中放棄了對它的擁有，如果未受具足戒的人碰巧將其歸還給他，那麼他可以保留它並繼續食用七天。</div>

Mahā Padumatthera disagrees, saying that the exemption <em>abandons it</em> already covers such a case, and that the exemption here refers to the situation where a bhikkhu has kept a tonic past seven days, has forfeited it and received it in return, and then gives it up to an unordained person. If the unordained person then returns the tonic to him, he may use it to rub on his body.</td>
<td>摩訶Padumatthera尊者不同意，他說，<em>放棄它</em>的豁免已經涵蓋了這種情況，這裡的豁免是指比丘保留補品超過七天，已經捨出並收到它作為回報，然後給予一位未受具足戒的人的情況。如果未受具足戒者隨後將補品歸還給他，他可以用它來塗抹身體。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary agrees with the latter position, but this creates some problems, both textual and practical. To begin with, the phrase, “if within seven days,” modifies every one of the other non-offense clauses under this rule, and there is nothing to indicate that it does not modify this one, too. Second, every one of the other exemptions refers directly to ways of avoiding the full offense and not to ways of dealing with the forfeited article after it is returned, and again there is nothing to indicate that the last exemption breaks this pattern.</td>
<td>K/《義註》同意後一種觀點，但這造成了一些問題，包括文字和實際問題。首先，「如果在七天之內」這句話修改了本戒條下的所有其他不犯條款，並且沒有任何跡象表明它不會修改這條。其次，其他每項豁免都直接提到了避免完全違犯的方式，而不是提到歸還捨出物品後的處理方式，而且沒有任何跡象表明最後一項豁免打破了這種模式。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>On the practical side, if the exemption <em>abandons it</em> covers cases where a bhikkhu may give up the tonic to anyone at all and then receive it in return to use for another seven days, bhikkhus could spend their time trading hoards of tonics among themselves indefinitely, and the rule would become meaningless. But as the origin story shows, it was precisely to prevent them from amassing such hoards that the rule was formulated in the first place.</td>
<td>從實際角度來看，如果<em>放棄它</em>的豁免涵蓋了比丘可以將補品給予任何人，然後再收到補藥以供使用七天的情況，比丘們可以無限期地花時間在他們之間交易補品，那麼本戒條就變得毫無意義了。但正如<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0354a14">起源故事</a>所示，最初制定本戒條正是為了防止他們累積如此多的東西。</td>

In this case, it says that the rains-bathing cloth—having been sought for during the fourth month and worn during the last two weeks of the hot season—is to be washed and then put aside. When the proper season arrives, it may be brought out for use (§).</td>
<td>《經分別》接著提到了陰曆中偶爾發生的情況：四個月的炎熱季節結束了，但雨安居又推遲了一個陰曆週期，因為在炎熱季節結束或者雨季的開始時又增加了第十三個陰曆月，使得陰曆年與陽曆年重新保持一致。在這種情況下，它說，在炎熱季節的第四個月尋求並在最後兩週穿著的雨浴衣需要清洗然後放在一邊。當適當的季節到來時，就可以拿出來使用（§）。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that there is no need to determine the cloth in this period until the day the Rains-residence officially starts, but it doesn’t say when the proper season for using it begins. Having made use of the two-week allowance for using the undetermined bathing cloth at the end of the hot season, is one granted another two-week allowance prior to the Rains-residence, or can one begin using it only when the Rains-residence begins? None of the texts say. It would make sense to allow the bhikkhu to begin using the cloth two weeks before the Rains-residence, but this is simply my own opinion.</td>
<td>《義註》補充道，直到雨安居正式開始的那一天為止，不需要決這段時期的衣物，但沒有說明使用它的適當季節從何時開始。在炎熱季節結束時，已經使用了兩週開緣的未決意浴衣，在雨安居之前，是否還獲得另外兩週的開緣，或者只能在雨安居時開始時才能開始使用？沒有任何文獻提及。允許比丘在雨安居前兩週開始使用衣物算是合理的，但這只是我個人的看法。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga then adds three more exemptions: There is no offense for a “snatched-away-robe” bhikkhu, a “destroyed-robe” bhikkhu, or when there are dangers. Strangely enough, the Commentary and the K/Commentary—although both were composed by Buddhaghosa—give conflicting interpretations of these exemptions. The Commentary interprets “robe” here as meaning rains-bathing cloth, and says that these exemptions apply to the dukkaṭa offense for bathing naked in the rain. A bhikkhu whose rains-bathing cloth has been snatched away or destroyed may bathe naked in the rain without incurring a penalty, as may a bhikkhu with an expensive bathing cloth who would rather bathe naked because of his fear of cloth thieves.</td>
<td>然後，《經分別》又增加了三種豁免：「被奪走袈裟」的比丘、「被毀壞袈裟」的比丘，或當有危險時，則不犯戒。奇怪的是，儘管《義註》和 K/《義註》都是由<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>編纂的，但對這些豁免的解釋卻相互矛盾。《義註》將這裡的「袈裟」解釋為雨浴衣，並表示這些豁免適用於在雨中裸浴的《突吉羅》罪。比丘的雨浴衣被搶走或毀壞，可以在雨中裸體沐浴而不受懲罰；如果比丘有一件昂貴的浴衣，但是由於害怕盜衣賊，他寧願裸體沐浴，那麼他也可以不受懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary, however, makes the Vibhaṅga’s exemptions refer also to the full offense. If a bhikkhu’s other robes have been snatched away or destroyed, he may wear his rains-bathing cloth out of season. The same holds true when, in the words of the K/Commentary, “naked thieves are plundering,” and a bhikkhu decides to wear his rains-bathing cloth out-of-season in order to protect either it or his other robes from being snatched away.</td>
<td>然而，K/《義註》使《經分別》的豁免也涉及完全違犯。如果比丘的其他袈裟被奪走或毀壞，他可以在非時季節穿著雨浴衣。同樣的情況也適用於，用 K/《義註》的話來說，「赤身裸體的盜賊正在掠奪」，而比丘決定在非時季節穿他的雨浴衣，以保護它或其他袈裟不被搶走。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because the non-offense clauses usually apply primarily to the full offense, it seems appropriate to follow the K/Commentary here.</td>
<td>由於不犯條款通常主要適用於完全違犯，因此遵循此處的 K/《義註》似乎是適當的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At present, much of this discussion is purely academic, inasmuch as most bhikkhus—if they use a bathing cloth—tend to determine it for use as a “requisite cloth” so as to avoid any possible offense under this rule.</td>

For these reasons, the compilers of the Commentary felt called upon to clarify the references and fill in the blanks even more than is normally the case.

<tr><td>Thread or yarn of the six allowable types for robe-cloth that a bhikkhu has himself requested from others. Because the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clauses give an exemption “to sew a robe,” the Commentary is apparently right in stating that, to fulfill this factor, the thread or yarn has to have been requested for the purpose of making robe-cloth. And because the non-offense clauses also state, “from relatives or people who have invited one to ask,” the Commentary also seems right in stating that thread requested from these two types of people would not fulfill this factor. However, none of the texts explicitly assign a penalty for requesting thread that would not fall under the exemptions. Perhaps it would entail a dukkaṭa under the catch-all rule against misbehavior (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Cv.V.36">Cv.V.36</a>).</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that there is a dukkaṭa in the effort of getting the weavers to weave the robe-cloth, which the Commentary explains by saying that the first dukkaṭa is incurred with the weavers’ first effort toward actually making the cloth, with additional dukkaṭas incurred for each additional effort they make. In other words, the dukkaṭa is for <em>successfully</em> getting the weavers to act on one’s request. It may seem strange not to allot a dukkaṭa for the request itself, but the Vibhaṅga to the following rule clearly states that the bhikkhu, in a similar case, incurs a dukkaṭa only when the weavers act on his request to improve a robe. The Vibhaṅga for this rule simply uses the causative—the form of verb describing the act of getting someone else to do something—which is ambiguous, for it could mean either trying to get the weavers to weave the cloth or successfully getting the weavers to weave the cloth. To clear up the ambiguity, the Commentary seems justified in applying the pattern from the following rule here. However, it seems excessive to impose multiple dukkaṭas on the bhikkhu for what, from his point of view, was a single action. There are many rules—such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">Pc 10</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc20">Pc 20</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc56">Pc 56</a>—where a single request carries only one offense even if the person requested does the action many times.</td>
<td>《經分別》中說，在讓織匠織造袈裟布的努力，會犯一次《突吉羅》，而《義註》則解釋說，第一次《突吉羅》是在織匠第一次努力實際織造布料時發生的，而額外的《突吉羅》則發生在他們每一次額外的努力。換句話說，《突吉羅》是針對<em>成功地</em>讓織匠按照自己的要求採取行動。請求本身不犯《突吉羅》似乎很奇怪，但以下戒條的《經分別》明確指出，在類似情況下，只有當織匠根據他的要求改善袈裟時，比丘才會犯《突吉羅》。本戒條的《經分別》僅使用使役動詞——描述讓別人做某事的行為的動詞形式——這是模棱兩可的，因為它可能意味著試圖讓織匠織布，也可能意味著成功地讓織匠織布。為了消除歧義，《義註》似乎有理由在此套用以下戒條的模式。然而，從比丘的角度來看，對於一個單一的行動而犯多次《突吉羅》似乎太過度了。有許多戒條（例如<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">《波逸提》十</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc20">《波逸提》二十</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc56">《波逸提》五六</a>），其中單次要求只會構成一次犯戒，即使被要求的人多次執行該行動。</td>

<tr><td>None of the texts discuss this point further, but the Commentary’s interpretation of the causative verb here apparently holds for other rules as well in which the Vibhaṅga imposes a penalty on a bhikkhu for improperly getting someone else to make an item for him, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP11">NP 11-15</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc86">Pc 86-92</a>: no offense for the request itself, but a dukkaṭa if the request successfully persuades the other person to act in line with it.

<tr><td>One obtains the cloth. According to the Commentary, the cloth counts as “obtained” when the weavers have completed weaving four by eight fingerbreadths of cloth. It also states that there is an extra NP offense for each added four-by-eight-fingerbreadths section they complete. Neither of these explanations has a precedent anywhere in the Canon. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0041.html#Mv.V.13.13">Mv.V.13.13</a> states clearly that the countdown on the time span of robe-cloth begins only when it is delivered to one’s hand, and the same principle would surely apply here: The full offense is incurred when the robe-cloth is delivered to one’s hand. As for the second explanation, the Vibhaṅga assigns only one full offense for receiving the cloth, which means that a larger piece of cloth would not carry more offenses than a smaller one.</td>
<td>得到了布料。根據《義註》，當織匠織完四乘八指寬的布料時，布料就算「獲得」。它還規定，他們每完成一個額外的四乘八指寬的部分，就會被犯一次額外的《捨墮》。這兩種解釋在《聖典》中都沒有任何先例。<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_005#0263a11">《大品》.五.13.13</a>明確指出，袈裟布的時間跨度倒數計時只有當它被送到手中時才開始，同樣的原則肯定也適用於這裡：當袈裟布被送到手中時，就會完全違犯。至於第二種解釋，《經分別》規定接受布料時只完全違犯一次，這意味著一塊大布料不會比一塊小布料犯更多次戒。</td>

<tr><td>Perception is not a factor here. The Vibhaṅga states if the cloth was woven as a result of one’s request, then even if one perceives it as not having been woven at one’s request or if one is in doubt about the matter, one incurs the full offense. If, on the other hand, the cloth was not woven at one’s request and yet one perceives it as having been woven at one’s request—or one is in doubt about the matter—the penalty on obtaining it is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>在此處，感知不是一個因素。《經分別》規定，如果這塊布是應自己的要求而織成的，那麼即使認為它不是應自己的要求而織成的，或者對該事情有懷疑，也會完全違犯。另一方面，如果這塊布不是應自己的要求而織成的，而卻認為它是應自己的要求而織成的——或者對此事有懷疑——那麼對獲得它的懲罰就是《突吉羅》。</td>

<td>《義註》將第一項豁免解釋為適用於本戒條中提到的第一個行動，這意味著向任何人索取線或紗線來縫製袈裟都沒有犯戒。這似乎是正確的，因為豁免的語法形式對於不犯條款來說是不尋常的，而且如果豁免是為了讓織匠縫製袈裟，並不遵循《經分別》所採用的模式。。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also states that the exemptions for a knee strap and the other small items also apply to the first action. In other words, one may request thread or yarn from anyone to make these items, but may not get weavers to weave them. This explanation seems designed to support the Commentary’s position that a piece of cloth measuring four by eight fingerbreadths would be grounds for a full offense under this rule. Here, however, the grammatical form of the relevant exemptions does <em>not</em> support the Commentary’s assertion, for it follows a pattern typical throughout the Vibhaṅga for non-offenses related to the main action covered by a rule. Thus there would be no offense in providing weavers with thread with which to make small items of this sort. Because these articles can be quickly woven, this may have been a common courtesy that weavers extended to contemplatives in the Buddha’s time.</td>
<td>《義註》也指出，膝帶和其他小件物品的豁免也適用於第一個行動。換句話說，可以向任何人要求線或紗來製作這些物品，但不能讓織匠來編織它們。這個解釋似乎是設計來支持《義註》的觀點，即一塊尺寸為四指乘以八指寬的布料將構成本戒條規定的完全違犯行為的理由。然而，這裡相關豁免的語法形式並<em>不</em>支持《義註》的斷言，因為它遵循了整個《經分別》中關於與戒條涵蓋的主要行為相關的不犯的典型模式。因此，向織匠提供用於製作此類小物件的線並不犯戒。由於這些物品可以快速編織完成，這可能是佛陀時代織匠對沙門的常見禮遇。</td>

<tr><td>If the cloth is obtained by means of one’s own resources—i.e., one arranges to pay for the thread and hire the weavers—the Commentary states that one is responsible for the cloth as soon as it is finished and fully paid for, regardless of whether it is delivered into one’s possession. One must therefore determine it for use within 10 days of that date so as not to commit an offense under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP1">NP 1</a>. (Alternatively, the Commentary suggests, one may avoid this difficulty by not giving full payment for the cloth until it is delivered.) If, after one has given full payment for the cloth, the weavers promise to send word when the cloth is done, one’s responsibility starts when one receives word from their messenger; if they have promised to send the cloth when done, one’s responsibility begins when their messenger delivers it. At any rate, as with its explanation of “obtaining cloth” under this rule, the Commentary’s statements here conflict with the principle in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0041.html#Mv.V.13.13">Mv.V.13.13</a>, in which the countdown on the time span of the cloth begins only when it is delivered to one’s hand.</td>
<td>如果布料是透過自己的資源獲得的——即自己安排支付線的費用並僱用織匠——《義註》指出，只要布料完成並全額付款，就應對布料負責，無論它是否已被交付到手中。因此，必須在該日期後的十天內決意使用，以免違反<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0013/#NP1">《捨墮》一</a>。（或者，《義註》建議，可以透過在布料交付之前不支付全額款項來避免這種困難。）如果在支付了布料的全部款項之後，織匠承諾在布料完成後捎來消息，那麼責任就從他收到信使的消息時開始；如果他們承諾完成後會把布料送來，那麼當信使送達時，責任就開始了。無論如何，正如對本戒條下「獲得布料」的解釋一樣，《義註》中的陳述與<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_005#0263a11">《大品》.五.13.13</a>中的原則相衝突，在該原則中，布料時間跨度的倒數計時僅在布料交付到手中才開始。</td>

<tr><td>One approaches the weavers and gets them to improve the cloth in any of the seven ways mentioned in the rule. Although the rule seems to indicate that the factor of effort is completed only when the weavers receive the promised reward, the Vibhaṅga says simply that it is completed when, as a result of one’s statement, the weavers improve the cloth as requested. In addition, the non-offense clauses give no exemption for a bhikkhu who does not give the promised reward. Thus, the bhikkhu does not have to give the reward for this factor to be fulfilled. The commentaries follow the Vibhaṅga on this point, and add that the bhikkhu’s statement need not even include a promise of a reward. As the Commentary puts it, the bhikkhu’s words quoted in the rule are meant simply as an example of any way in which one might get them to add more thread to the cloth. The Sub-commentary, however, notes that of the seven ways of improving the cloth, only the first three involve added thread. Its implied conclusion is that any statement that succeeds in getting the weavers to improve the cloth in any of these seven ways would fulfill the factor of effort here, regardless of whether the improvement involves adding more thread.</td>
<td>聯繫織匠並讓他們按照戒條中提到的七種方法中的任何一種方法來改進布料。雖然戒條似乎表明，只有當織匠收到承諾的獎勵時，努力的因素才算完成，但《經分別》僅說，當織匠根據陳述，按照要求改進布料時，努力的因素就完成。此外，不犯條款並未給予沒有承諾獎勵的比丘任何豁免。因此，比丘不必給予獎勵就滿足這個因素。註釋書在這一點上遵循了《經分別》，並補充說，比丘的陳述甚至不需要包括獎勵的承諾。正如《義註》中所說，戒條中引用的比丘的話只是為了舉例說明如何讓他們在布上添加更多的線。然而，《複註》指出，在七種改良布料的方法中，只有前三種需要添加線。其隱含的結論是，任何成功地讓織匠以這七種方式中的任何一種來改進布料的陳述都可以滿足這裡的努力因素，不管這種改進是否涉及添加更多的線。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the promised reward, the Vibhaṅga defines <em>almsfood</em> as covering anything of even the slightest material value—food, a lump of powder, tooth wood, unwoven thread, or even a phrase of Dhamma. (For example, the bhikkhu might try to get the weavers to improve the cloth by promising to describe the merit they will gain by doing so.) Note, however, that almsfood is defined as the minimal amount of reward. There is no maximum on what might be promised. Thus, even if the bhikkhu promises to pay in full for any added materials or time that the weavers might devote to the robe, he does not escape fulfilling this factor of the offense. (Some have objected that it should be all right for the bhikkhu to pay in full for the improvements in the robe, but remember that to do so would be an insult to the donors.)</td>
<td>至於承諾的獎勵，《經分別》將缽食定義為任何具有最微小物質價值的東西，如食物、一塊粉末、牙木、未編織的線、甚至一句佛法。（例如，比丘可能會試圖讓織匠改善布料，並承諾描述他們這樣做將獲得的功德。）但請注意，缽食被定義為最低限度的獎勵。對於承諾之物沒有上限。因此，即使比丘承諾全額支付織匠為製作袈裟所花費的任何額外材料或時間，他仍然逃脫不了滿足本戒的此因素。（有些人反對，認為比丘全額支付改善袈裟的費用是可以的，但請記住，這樣做是對施主的侮辱。）</td>
