<tr><td>This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.</td>
<td>根據《附隨》，這個術語源自於一個動詞，意思是「失去」或「被擊敗」。比丘若犯下列四條戒中的任何一種，就已經屈服於自己的心理煩惱，以致他違背了自己成為比丘的初衷。《經分別》中用許多比喻說明了這種擊敗的不可挽回的性質：「就像一個人的頭被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的葉子脫離了莖……就像一塊被碎成兩半的扁平石頭無法再拼湊起來……就像一棵被砍掉樹冠的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B3%96%E6%A3%95">糖棕</a>無法進一步生長一樣。” 犯下任何這些戒的比丘不可挽回地從僧團生活中斷絕，並且不再被視為比丘。</td>

His motives, by worldly standards, were relatively noble: He was complying with his parents’ desire that he provide them with an heir.

<p>“Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu living in the Great Wood at Vesālī, having befriended a monkey with food (§), engaged in sexual intercourse with it.

A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§). The thought occurred to the bhikkhus, ‘Undoubtedly this bhikkhu is engaging in sexual intercourse with this monkey.’ So they hid off to one side.</p>

<tr><td>The term <em>sexual intercourse</em> refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (<em>passāva-magga</em>)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (<em>vacca-magga</em>); or the mouth (<em>mukha</em>). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using <em>magga</em> (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and <em>amagga</em> (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.</td>
<td><em>性交</em>一詞是指所有類型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（<em>passāva-magga</em>），即女性的陰道或男性的陰莖）；肛門（<em>vacca-magga</em>）；或嘴（<em>mukha</em>）。《經分別》總結了這些孔穴的各種可能的組合，並得出結論：除了口對口的插入（在下面的衍生違犯中處理）之外，所有這些孔穴都滿足了這裡的努力因素。不幸的是，《經分別》的總結是用技術術語表達的，使用 <em>magga</em> （道）來表示生殖器或肛門，使用 <em>amagga</em> （非道）來表示嘴。《義註》在討論總結時，錯誤地將嘴也歸類為道，因此必須為「非道」發明一個不同的意義：與三道之一接壤的傷口。由於《義註》對這一點的討論是基於誤解，因此無需進一步追究。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，當在該戒條涵蓋的任何可能的組合中，一個器官進入另一個器官時，即使只是達到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表發生了性交。這意味著比丘進行性交、口交或肛交時，無論他扮演什麼角色，都隸屬於這條戒條。器官之間是否有覆蓋物（例如保險套）的問題不相干，比丘是主動參與還是被動參與，以及參與的任何一方是否達到性高潮的問題都是不相干的。</td>

<tr><td>For sexual intercourse to count as an offense, the bhikkhu must know that it is happening and give his consent. Thus if he is sexually assaulted while asleep or otherwise unconscious and remains oblivious to what is happening, he incurs no penalty. If, however, he becomes conscious during the assault or was conscious right from the start, then whether he incurs a penalty depends on whether he gives his consent during any part of the act.</td>
<td>將性交算做犯戒，比丘必須知道它正在發生並給予他的同意。因此，如果他在睡覺或失去知覺時遭到性侵犯，並且對發生的事情渾然不覺，他不會受到懲罰。然而，如果他在襲擊過程中變得清醒，或者從一開始就清醒了，那麼他是否受到懲罰取決於他在行為的任何部分是否表示同意。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Strangely enough, neither the Canon nor the Commentary discusses the factor of consent in any detail, except to mention by way of passing that it can apply to the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out. From the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, it would appear that consent refers to a <em>mental</em> state of acquiescence, together with its physical or verbal expression. Mere physical compliance does not count, as there are cases where bhikkhus forced into intercourse comply physically but without consenting mentally and so are absolved of any offense. However, there is also a case in which a woman invites a bhikkhu to engage in sexual intercourse, saying that she will do all the work while he can avoid an offense by doing nothing. The bhikkhu does as she tells him to, but when the case comes to the Buddha’s attention, the Buddha imposes a pārājika on the act without even asking the bhikkhu whether he consented or not. The assumption is that complying with a request like this indicates consent, regardless of whether one makes any physical or verbal movement at all.</td>
<td>奇怪的是，《聖典》和《義註》都沒有詳細討論同意因素，只是順便提到它可以適用於插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出的階段。從《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的例子來看，同意看來是指一種默許的<em>心理</em>狀態，連同其身體或言語表達。僅僅身體上的順從並不算數，因為在某些情況下，比丘被迫進行性交，但沒有心理上的同意，因此沒有犯任何戒。然而，也有一種情況，女人邀請比丘發生性行為，說她會做所有的工作，他什麼都不做就可以避免犯戒。比丘照她的吩咐去做，但當這件事引起佛陀的注意時，佛陀甚至沒有詢問比丘是否同意，就認定該行為犯《波羅夷》。前提是，遵守這樣的請求就表明同意，無論一個人是否做出任何身體或口頭動作。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Taken together, these cases imply that if one is sexually assaulted, one is completely absolved from an offense only if (1) one does not give one’s mental consent at any time during the act or (2) one does feel mental consent during at least part of the act but puts up a struggle so as not to express that consent physically or verbally in any way. (As the Commentary notes, drawing a general principle from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>, mere mental consent without physical expression is not enough to count as a factor of an offense, for there is no offense simply in the arising of a thought or mental state.) If one puts up no struggle and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out, one incurs the full penalty. This would seem to be the basis for the Commentary’s warning in its discussion of the Vinīta-vatthu case in which a bhikkhu wakes up to find himself being sexually assaulted by a woman, gives her a kick, and sends her rolling. The warning: This is how a bhikkhu still subject to sensual lust should act if he wants to protect his state of mind.</td>
<td>總而言之，這些案例意味著，如果一個人受到性侵犯，只有在以下情況下才可以完全免除犯戒：（1）一個人在行為過程中的任何時候都沒有心理上同意，或者（2）一個人至少在行為過程中的某部份確實感到心理上的同意，但奮力掙扎避免以任何方式透過身體或口頭表達同意。（如《義註》中所指出的，從<a class="reference external" href="#pr2">《波羅夷》二</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中得出一條一般原則，僅在心理上同意而沒有身體表達，不足以算作犯戒的一個因素，因為僅僅在想法或心理狀態中產生並不構成犯戒。）如果一個人沒有做出任何掙扎並感到精神上同意，即使只是在插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出階段短暫地發生，也會受到全額懲罰。這似乎是《義註》在討論《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》的例子時發出警告的基礎，在該案例中，一名比丘醒來，發現自己遭到一名女人的性侵犯，踢了她一腳，然後讓她滾出去。警告：如果一個比丘仍然受制於色欲，他想要保護他的心境，就應該這樣做。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu with “impaired faculties”—one who feels neither pleasure nor pain during intercourse—engages in intercourse under the assumption that his impairment exempts him from the rule. The case is brought to the Buddha, who states, “Whether this worthless man did or didn’t feel [anything], it is a case involving defeat.” From this ruling it can be argued that a bhikkhu indulging in intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty even if he doesn’t feel pleasure in the course of the act.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中記載了一個案例，一位「官能受損」的比丘——在性交時既感覺不到快樂也感覺不到痛苦——認為他的缺陷使他不受戒條約束而進行性交。這個案例被提交給佛陀，佛陀說：“無論這個愚癡人有沒有（任何）感覺，這都是一個《波羅夷》的案例。” 從這個裁決可以看出，一個比丘在密宗儀式中沉溺於性交，即使他在行為過程中沒有感到快樂，也會受到全額懲罰。</td>

<tr><td>Two thullaccaya offenses are directly related to this rule. The first is for mouth-to-mouth penetration— i.e., the act of inserting any part of one’s mouth into the mouth of another person, or consenting to the insertion of another person’s mouth in one’s own—regardless of whether the other person is a man, a woman, or a common animal. When this act occurs under the influence of lust, as in an intense kiss, the thullaccaya here would be incurred in addition to whatever penalty is assigned for lustful bodily contact under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>.</td>
<td>兩種《偷蘭遮》罪與此戒條直接相關。第一種是口對口插入－即將一個人的嘴的任何部分插入另一個人的嘴裡，或同意另一個人的嘴插入自己的嘴裡的行為－無論對方是否是一個男人，女人，或普通的動物。當這種行為在性欲的影響下發生時，例如在激烈的接吻中，除了根據<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>對出於性欲的身體接觸所規定的懲罰之外，還會犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The second thullaccaya is for the unlikely case of a bhikkhu who attempts intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse. To attempt intercourse with any other part of a dead body or with any part of an insentient object, such as an inflatable doll or mannequin, incurs a dukkaṭa. (If this led to an ejaculation, however, the case would be treated under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>.)</td>
<td>第二種《偷蘭遮》是針對一個不太可能發生的情況，即比丘試圖與屍體腐爛的嘴巴、肛門或生殖器性交。試著與屍體的任何其他部分或無知覺物體的任何部位（例如充氣娃娃或人體模型）進行性交，都會犯《突吉羅》。（但是，如果這導致射精，則該情況將根據<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧殘》一</a>進行處理。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a> for intentional ejaculation or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> for lustful bodily contact. As we shall see below, the penalties assigned in the latter case are as follows: if the partner is a woman, a saṅghādisesa; if a <em>paṇḍaka</em> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>), a thullaccaya; if a man or a common animal, a dukkaṭa. We can infer from the Vibhaṅga’s ruling here that if a bhikkhu has an orgasm while attempting intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse, with any other part of a dead body, or with any part of an insentient object, the case would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部位發生性交，這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條－若非<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧殘》一</a>代表故意射精，則為<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>代表出於性欲的身體接觸。正如我們將在下面看到的，後一種情況的懲罰如下：如果對象是女人，《僧殘》；如果是<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/p/pa%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Daka/">黃門</a> <em>paṇḍaka</em> （參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>），《偷蘭遮》；如果是男人或普通動物，《突吉羅》。在此我們可以從《經分別》的裁決中推斷出，如果一個比丘在嘗試與屍體腐爛的嘴、肛門或生殖器，或與屍體的任何其他部分，或與無知覺物體的任何部分性交時獲得性高潮，該情況屬於<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧殘》一</a>。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary disagrees with the Vibhaṅga on these points, however, saying that the derived offenses under this rule can include only dukkaṭa and thullaccaya penalties. In its explanation of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>, it sets forth a system of eleven types of lust in which the lust for the pleasure of bringing about an ejaculation, lust for the pleasure of bodily contact, and lust for the pleasure of intercourse are treated as completely separate things that must be treated under separate rules. Thus, it says, if a bhikkhu aiming at intercourse takes hold of a woman’s body, it is simply a preliminary to intercourse and thus entails only a dukkaṭa, rather than a saṅghādisesa for lustful bodily contact. Similarly, if he has a premature ejaculation before beginning intercourse, there is no offense at all.</td>
<td>然而，《義註》在這些觀點上不同意《經分別》，稱此戒條衍生的違犯只能包括《突吉羅》和《偷蘭遮》懲罰。在對<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧殘》一</a>的解釋中，它提出了十一種性欲的系統，其中對射精快感的性欲，對身體接觸快感的性欲，和對性交快感的性欲被視為完全不同的事情，必須根據不同的戒條處理。因此，它說，如果一個以性交為目的的比丘抓住了一個女人的身體，這只是性交的一個預備行動，因此只犯《突吉羅》，而不是出於性欲身體接觸的《僧殘》。同樣地，如果他在開始性交之前出現早洩，也沒有任何犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>These are fine academic distinctions and are clearly motivated by a desire to draw neat lines between the rules, but they lead to practical problems. As the Commentary itself points out, if a bhikkhu commits an act that falls near the borderline between these rules but cannot later report precisely which type of lust he was feeling in the heat of the moment, there is no way his case can be judged and a penalty assigned. At any rate, though, there is no basis in the Canon for the Commentary’s system, and in fact it contradicts not only the Vibhaṅga’s ruling mentioned above, but also its definition of <em>lustful</em> under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg3">3</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg4">4</a>, which is exactly the same for all three rules and places no limits on the type of lust involved. All of this leads to the conclusion that the Commentary’s neat system for classifying lust is invalid, and that the Vibhaṅga’s judgment holds: If a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a> for intentional ejaculation or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> for lustful bodily contact—rather than here.</td>
<td>這些都是很好的學術區別，顯然是出於希望在戒條之間劃清界線的動機，但它們會導致實際問題。正如《義註》本身指出的那樣，如果比丘所犯下的行為接近這些戒條的邊緣，但後來無法準確地報告他在一時衝動中感受到哪種類型的欲望，那麼他的情況就無法判斷並給予懲罰。但，無論如何，《義註》的系統在《聖典》中是沒有任何依據的，事實上，它不僅與上述《經分別》的裁決相矛盾，而且也與在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg3">三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg4">四</a>中對<em>性欲</em>的定義相矛盾，這個定義在所有三個戒條都是相同的，並且對所涉及的性欲類型沒有限制。這一切都得出這樣的結論：《義註》對性欲進行分類的簡潔工整系統是無效的，而《經分別》的判斷是成立的：如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部分進行交合，那麼這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條的範疇－若非<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧殘》一</a>代表故意射精，則為<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>代表出於性欲的身體接觸－而不是這裡。</td>

<tr><td>In addition to bhikkhus who do not know they are being assaulted or do not give their consent when they do know, the Vibhaṅga states that there are four special categories of bhikkhus exempted from a penalty under this rule: any bhikkhu who is insane, possessed by spirits, delirious with pain, or the first offender(s) (in this case, Ven. Sudinna and the bhikkhu with the monkey) whose actions prompted the Buddha to formulate the rule. The Commentary defines as <em>insane</em> anyone who “goes about in an unseemly way, with deranged perceptions, having cast away all sense of shame and compunction, not knowing whether he has transgressed major or minor training rules.” It recognizes this as a medical condition, which it blames on the bile. A bhikkhu under the influence of a severe psychosis-inducing drug would apparently fall under this exemption, but one under the influence of a more common intoxicant would not. As for spirit possession, the Commentary says that this can happen either when spirits frighten one or when, by distracting one with sensory images, they insert their hands into one’s heart by way of one’s mouth (!). Whatever the cause, it notes that insane and possessed bhikkhus are exempt from penalties they incur only when their perceptions are deranged (“when their mindfulness is entirely forgotten and they don’t know what fire, gold, excrement, and sandalwood are”) and not from any they incur during their lucid moments. As for a bhikkhu delirious with pain, he is exempt from penalties he incurs only during periods when the pain is so great that he does not know what he is doing.</td>
<td>除了不知道自己受到侵犯或明知後不同意的比丘外，《經分別》指出，有四種特殊類別的比丘可免受此戒條的處罰：任何精神錯亂的比丘、被附身、或因痛苦而發狂神智不清，或最初犯戒者（在本例中，是須提那尊者和與猴子在一起的比丘），他們的行為促使佛陀制定了戒條。《義註》將<em>精神錯亂</em>定義為「行為不得體，知覺錯亂，已拋棄所有慚愧感，不知犯大、小學處」的人。它認為這是一種健康狀況，並將其歸咎於膽汁。受到嚴重的誘發精神病藥物影響的比丘顯然屬於這裡的豁免範圍，但受到更常見的麻醉劑影響的比丘則不然。至於附身，《義註》說，這種情況可能發生在靈體嚇唬人的時候，或者當靈體通過感官圖像分散人的注意力，通過人的嘴將手插入人的心臟時（！）。無論出於什麼原因，它指出，精神錯亂和被附身的比丘只有在他們的知覺錯亂時（“當他們的正念完全被遺忘，並且他們不知道火，金，糞便和檀香是什麼時”）才可以免受懲罰，在清醒時所發生則不能豁免。至於因痛苦而發狂神智不清的比丘，只有當疼痛劇烈到他不知道自己在做什麼時，他才可以免於懲罰。<!-- https://deerpark.app/reader/X0709/2

The Commentary, in some of its examples, includes items given up for lost under “abandoned,” but this interpretation has to be heavily qualified. If the owner retains a sense of ownership for the lost item, it would fall under the term <em>claimed</em>, and thus would still count as not given.

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if people are guarding an object as the property of a location—for example, an offering to a Buddha image, cetiya, or other sacred place—the object would also qualify as “not given” under this rule.

Nevertheless, the Commentary’s judgment on this point reflects a custom that had become widespread by its time, that of giving valuable items to a cetiya (this includes Buddha images) and dedicating them not to the Saṅgha but to the cetiya. Some medieval Indian Buddhist inscriptions express the idea that the cetiya or the Buddha relics (if any) within the cetiya actually own such objects, but the Commentary states that these objects have an owner simply in the sense that human beings are watching over them for the purpose of the cetiya. The jewels decorating the reliquary of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy or the offerings to the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok, for example, would fall under this category. According to the Commentary, the Saṅgha is duty-bound to care for such items but has no rights of ownership over them. In its discussion both of this rule and of Pv.XIX, it states that items given to the Saṅgha may be used for the purpose of the cetiya—for example, to contribute to its decoration or upkeep—but items given to the cetiya may not be used for the purpose of the Saṅgha.</td>

If it contains just thread, and he returns it to its place, he commits no offense. If, however, the bhikkhu takes the sack thinking, “I’ll steal whatever is in the sack,” the Commentary maintains that he is not guilty of stealing until he finds out what the sack contains and then picks it up again, but this case does not really fit under this category, as the bhikkhu has actually placed no condition on the article and so stole it when he first picked it up.</td>
<td>《義註》討論了帶有條件意圖<em>（parikappāvahāra）</em>拿取物品的兩種情況：對物品設定條件，以及對地點設定條件。它用一個比丘的例子來說明第一個情況，他進入一個黑暗的儲藏室，拿起一袋裝滿物品的袋子，心想：「如果袋子裡有布，我就偷它；如果它只包含線，我不偷。」在這種情況下，如果袋子裡確實裝有布，那麼當比丘把袋子從原來的位置移開時，它就被偷了（見下文）。如果裡面只有線，他把它放回原處，他就沒有犯戒。然而，如果比丘拿起袋子時心裡想：「我要偷袋子裡的東西」，《義註》認為，在他發現袋子裡裝著什麼，然後再把它拿起來之前，他並沒有犯偷竊，但這個情況並不真正屬於這一類，因為比丘實際上沒有對這個物品設定任何條件，所以當他第一次拿起它時就偷走了它。</td>

<tr><td><em>Placing a condition on the place</em> means thinking, “If I can take this item past such-and-such a place (such as a gateway), I’ll steal it; if anyone sees me beforehand, I’ll pretend that I’m just looking at it and will return it to its place.” Because one has not definitely decided to steal it when first picking it up, the theft is committed only when one takes the item past the determined place.</td>
<td><em>對地點設定條件</em>意味著心想：「如果我可以帶著這個物品通過某某地點（例如出入口），我就會偷它；如果有人先看到我，我會假裝我只是在看它，把它放回原處。」由於第一次拿起物品時並沒有明確決定要偷竊，只有當拿物品通過了決意的地點時才算偷竊。</td>

<tr><td><em>Moving the object from one part of one’s body to another:</em> an object that one is already carrying before deciding to steal it.

The Commentary notes that this definition applies only to cases where the owners have not asked one to carry the article for them. Neither the Commentary nor the Sub-commentary explains this condition, but a possible reason might be that if they have asked a bhikkhu to carry the article for them, without their intending for him to give it to someone else, it would count as guarded by him or deposited with him for safe keeping, and thus would fall under another category. If, on the other hand, they asked him to carry the object to give to someone else and he decided to take it for himself, the case would come under Deceit, discussed below.</td>

If the animal is lying down, simply getting it to get up on its feet counts as taking it. In the case of helping a slave to escape from slavery, if the slave follows one’s order or advice to escape, one is guilty of taking; but if one simply informs the slave of good ways to reach freedom or offers food or protection along the way, one incurs no offense.</td>

<tr><td>The discussion in the Commentary and Sub-commentary indicates that the two categories of “objects a bhikkhu has been asked to guard,” and “objects deposited with a bhikkhu for safe keeping” differ in that in the latter case the object has been handed to the bhikkhu, whereas in the former it hasn’t. This, however, does not fit with the Vibhaṅga, which in defining “deposited” uses the word <em>upanikkhitaṁ</em>, which in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">NP 18</a> means “placed down next to.” A way to distinguish the two categories more closely in line with the Vibhaṅga would be to say that, in the latter case, the object is in such a location that the owner, in order to retrieve it, would have to ask the bhikkhu’s permission to do so, whereas in the former he/she wouldn’t. For example, an item placed in the bhikkhu’s hut or a monastery storeroom would count as deposited with the bhikkhu—regardless of whether it had been handed to him—whereas an item set by the side of a public road—with the bhikkhu simply asked to watch over it for a short period of time—would count as an object he has been asked to guard.</td>
<td>《義註》和《複註》中的討論表明，「比丘被要求看守的物品」和「存放給比丘妥善保管的物品」這兩類的不同之處在於，在後一種情況下，該物品已被交給比丘，而前者卻沒有。然而，這與《經分別》不符，《經分別》在定義「存放」時使用了「<em>upanikkhitaṁ</em>」一詞，在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">《捨墮》一八</a>中意思是「放置在旁邊」。一種更符合《經分別》的區分這兩個類別的方法是，在後一種情況下，物品所在的位置使得所有者為了取回它，必須徵求比丘的許可取回，而在前者中他/她不必。例如，放置在比丘小屋（孤邸）或寺院儲藏室中的物品將被視為存放在比丘那裡——無論它是否已交給他——而放置在公共道路旁的物品——比丘只被要求短時間看管——就算是被要求看守的物品。<!-- TODO FIXME: replace link to 《捨墮》一八 -->

The Vinaya-mukha notes that this contradicts the preceding definition of how one takes a piece of land, as the owner might not even know that the marker had been moved, and would not necessarily give up ownership even if he/she saw a bhikkhu moving it. The Sub-commentary tries to explain the discrepancy by maintaining that shifting a boundary marker fulfills the factor of effort here only if the act of shifting the marker, in and of itself, induces the owner to give up any efforts to reclaim the land, but that would make this category superfluous. A better explanation would be that this definition of taking applies to attempts to lay claim to Saṅgha land, for otherwise—if land can be stolen only when the owner abandons ownership—then Saṅgha land could not be stolen, because there is no one acting for the Saṅgha of the Four Directions who could renounce once and for all any efforts to reclaim the land.</td>
<td><em>移動界碑：</em>一塊土地。《戒律入口》指出，這與前面關於如何「拿取」一塊土地的定義相矛盾，因為所有者甚至可能不知道界碑已被移動，即使他/她看到比丘移動，也不一定會放棄所有權。《複註》試圖解釋這種差異，認為只有當移動界碑的行為本身導致所有者放棄任何收回土地的努力時，移動界碑才滿足此處的努力因素，但這將使這個類別變得多餘。更好的解釋是，這種「拿取」的定義適用於試圖聲稱擁有僧伽土地所有權，否則——如果土地只有在所有者放棄所有權時才能被盜——那麼僧伽土地就不可能被盜，因為沒有人可以代表四方僧伽一勞永逸地放棄任何收回土地的努力。</td>

<tr><td>Of these various ways of taking, the Commentary devotes the most space to the first, “moving the object from its place.” Its discussion is at odds with the Canon on many points, most notably in striking out the separate categories for taking large objects from a container (removing it entirely from the mouth of a container) and boats (causing them to move a hair-breadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water), and simply subsuming them under this category. Although it may have regarded these separate categories as arbitrary, it introduces many arbitrary distinctions and inconsistencies of its own. Apparently its distinctions come from the ancient commentaries, for even Buddhaghosa expresses despair at trying to commit them all to writing. Here we will stick with the Canon’s scheme for defining the act of taking, and focus on the parts of the Commentary’s discussion that accord with the Canon. As for those that deviate from the Canon, only important deviations will be noted.</td>
<td>在這些不同的「拿取」方式中，《義註》用了最多的篇幅來描述第一種，「將物品從原來的位置移動」。它的討論在許多方面與《聖典》不一致，最值得注意的是，刪除了從容器中拿取大型物體（將其完全從容器口取出）和船隻（導致它們向上游、下游或穿過水體移動毫髮寬度）的單獨類別，並單純地將它們歸入此類別。儘管它可能認為這些單獨的類別是隨意的，但它自己卻引入了許多隨意的區分和不一致。顯然，它的區分來自古代註釋，因為即使是<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>也對試圖將它們全部寫入文字表示絕望。這裡我們將堅持《聖典》定義「拿取」行為的方案，並著重在《義註》中符合《聖典》的部分。至於那些偏離《聖典》的內容，只會指出重要的偏差。</td>

<tr><td>In general, the Commentary defines an object’s place in terms of the directions in which it can be moved: up, down (as when an object sitting on sand can be pushed down into the sand), left, right, forward (toward the person taking it), and away. With reference to the last five of these actions, the place of the object is defined in three-dimensional terms: the space it occupies. Thus to take an object in any of these directions, one must push or pull it entirely outside of the coordinates of the space it initially occupied. However, with reference to lifting the object up, the place is defined in two-dimensional terms: the area of contact between the object and its support, whether that support is another object or the ground. Thus to take an object by lifting it, one only need lift it a hairbreadth from its support.</td>
<td>總體來說，《義註》根據物體可以被移動的方向來定義物體的位置：上、下（如當坐在沙上的物體可以被推入沙子時）、左、右、前進（朝向拿取者），和遠離。關於這些動作中的最後五個，物體的位置是用三維術語定義的：它所佔據的空間。因此，要沿著這些方向中的任何一個方向拿取物體，必須將其完全推或拉到其最初佔據的空間座標之外。然而，關於舉起物體，該位置是用二維術語定義的：物體與其支撐物之間的接觸面積，無論該支撐物是另一個物體還是地面。因此，要舉起一個物體來拿取，只需將其從支撐物上舉起毫髮寬度即可。</td>

<tr><td>Because objects in the air have no support, the Commentary defines their space in three-dimensional terms no matter which direction they are moved. For instance, if one catches a piece of cloth being blown by the wind, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment one catches it. If one stops a flying peacock without touching it, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment it stops to hover. In either case, the object is taken when displaced any direction outside the coordinates of that space. In the case of the cloth, this could be done simply by dropping it. In the case of the peacock, it could be done by waving one’s hands and getting it to fly in the desired direction. If the peacock happens to land on one’s arm, it is taken when one moves it to another part of one’s body or puts it down.</td>
<td>由於空氣中的物體沒有支撐，因此無論它們被向哪個方向移動，《義註》都以三維術語定義它們的空間。比如說，如果你抓住一塊被風吹動的布，它所在的位置就是一個人在抓住它的那一刻所佔據的三維空間。如果一個人停止一隻飛翔的孔雀而不觸碰它，那麼它所在的位置就是它停止盤旋那一刻所佔據的三維空間。在任何一種情況下，當物體被移位到在該空間的座標之外的任何方向時，就算被拿取。就布料而言，只需將其掉落就算完成拿取。就孔雀而言，只需揮動雙手，讓它朝著想要的方向飛去就算完成拿取。如果孔雀剛好落在一個人的手臂上，當一個人將它移到身體的另一個部位或將它放下時，就算被拿取。</td>

<td>活人身上的物體（例如人手臂上的手鐲）以人的身體作為其位置。因此，如果在試圖取下手鐲時，將其在手臂上下拉動，則手鐲尚未被拿取。只有當一個人將手鐲完全從手中拿開時，才算被拿取。如果有人偷了某人的衣服，只有當衣服從他/她身上脫下來時才算被拿取。如果被剝去衣服的人仍然抓著衣服，只有從他/她的手中拉出衣服時，衣服才算被拿取。</td>

<tr><td>For some objects, the Commentary defines <em>place</em> in terms that seem rather arbitrary. For instance, a robe on a line is taken when it is lifted a hairbreadth off the line, but for some reason if it is moved along the line it is not taken until it is ten or twelve fingerbreadths away from the area it originally occupied on the line. An object leaning against a wall has two places: the spot where it sits on the ground and the spot it touches on the wall. A vehicle’s place is defined two-dimensionally: the spots where its wheels touch the ground (perhaps this is defined on analogy with the feet of an animal). An object tied to a post has that connection as an extra part of its place. Thus a pot tied by a chain to a post is not taken until it is removed from the area it occupied under the general definition above <em>and</em> either the chain is cut or the post pulled up. Although there is a certain logic to each of these cases, the added distinctions seem unnecessary complications added to an already complicated issue. For simplicity’s sake there would seem every reason to stick with the general definition of place even in these special cases, although there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove or disprove the Commentary here.</td>
<td>對於某些物體，《義註》對<em>位置</em>的定義似乎相當隨意。例如，當一條線上的袈裟被提高離該線一毫髮寬度時，它就算被拿取，但由於某種原因，如果它沿著該線被移動，直到它距離它在該線上原來佔據的區域十或十二個手指寬度時，它才算被拿取。靠在牆上的物體有兩個位置：它位於地面上的位置和它接觸牆壁的位置。車輛的位置是二維定義的：車輪接觸地面的點（也許這是透過類比動物的腳來定義的）。綁在柱子上的物體將該連接作為其位置的額外部分。因此，用鏈條綁在柱子上的罐子不算被拿取，直到將其從根據上面一般定義的所佔據區域移開<em>並且</em>鏈條被切斷或柱子被拔起為止。儘管每種情況都有一定的邏輯，但增加的差異似乎為本已複雜的問題增添了不必要的複雜性。為了簡單起見，即使在這些特殊情況下，似乎也有充分的理由堅持位置的一般定義，儘管《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明或反駁這裡的《義註》。</td>

<tr><td>However, as noted above, several of the Commentary’s definitions of <em>place</em> clearly contradict the Vibhaṅga. In some cases, the contradiction is simple, as when the Commentary insists that an animal kept in an enclosure—a cow in a pen, a peacock in a garden—is taken not when its feet are moved, but only when removed from the enclosure. In other cases, the contradiction is more complex, in that the Commentary tries to define <em>taking</em> as “moving the object from its place” in cases where the Vibhaṅga defines the act of taking in other terms. For example, with an object sitting in the bottom of a container, it says that the object is taken when lifted a hairbreadth from the bottom, there being no need to remove the object from the container before it is considered taken. In the case of a boat, the Commentary defines the place of the boat in modified three-dimensional terms: the entire space where the boat displaces water. To take it by pushing it down in the water, the top of the boat has to sink lower than the level where the keel originally was; to take it by lifting it up, one need only lift it a hairbreadth above the water, there being no need to lift the keel to a point higher than where the highest point of the boat was. However, because the Vibhaṅga does not define the taking of boats or objects in containers in terms of “moving the object from its place,” the Commentary’s analysis of these possibilities is beside the point.</td>
<td>然而，如上所述，《義註》中對<em>位置</em>的一些定義顯然與《經分別》相矛盾。在某些情況下，矛盾很簡單，例如當《義註》堅持認為飼養在圍起來的區域中的動物（圍欄中的牛，花園中的孔雀）不是在其腳移動時才被拿取，而是只有在從圍起來的區域中移出時才被拿取。在其他情況下，矛盾更為複雜，因為《義註》試圖將「<em>拿取</em>」定義為「將物品從原來的位置移動」，而《經分別》以其他術語定義「拿取」的行為。例如，如果一個物體位於容器的底部，它說該物體從底部抬起一毫髮寬度時就被拿取了，在該物體被視為拿取之前，不需要將其從容器中取出。就船隻的情況而言，《義註》以修改後的三維術語定義了船隻的位置：船排開水的整個空間。為了透過將其推入水中來拿取它，船的頂部必須下沉到低於船的龍骨原來所在的水平；為了透過舉起來拿取它，只需將其舉出水面一毫髮寬度即可，無需將龍骨舉得高於船之前的最高點。然而，由於《經分別》並沒有將拿取船隻或容器中的物體定義為「將物品從原來的位置移動」，因此《義註》對這些可能性的分析是不是重點，與主題無關。</td>

The Vibhaṅga offers no further explanation, but the Commentary states that the taking can be accomplished in various ways. If, after the drawing of the tickets, X puts his ticket in the place of Y’s ticket before picking up Y’s, the taking is accomplished when he picks up Y’s. If he picks up Y’s before putting his own ticket in its place, the taking is accomplished when he lets go of his own. If both tickets don’t appear (they’ve been concealed?) and X gets Y to take X’s portion, the taking is accomplished when he then picks up Y’s portion. The underlying assumption in all this is that Y’s portion belongs to him as soon as he has drawn the ticket for it. The Commentary adds that this exchange counts as theft regardless of whether X’s portion is worth more than Y’s, less than Y’s, or the two portions are of equal value.</td>
<td><em>a. 詐騙：</em>物品以抽籤的方式分發給僧團，一個比丘理應拿取的部份卻到了另一個比丘那裡。《經分別》沒有提供進一步的解釋，但《義註》指出，可以透過多種方式完成拿取。如果在抽籤後，X 在拿取 Y 的籤之前，將自己的籤放在 Y 的籤的位置上，則當他拿取 Y 的籤時，即完成拿取。如果他在將自己的籤放回原來的位置之前拿起 Y 的籤，那麼當他放開自己的籤時，就完成了拿取。如果兩張籤都沒有出現（它們被隱藏了？）並且 X 讓 Y 拿走了 X 的部分，那麼當他拿起 Y 的部分時，拿取就完成了。所有這一切的基本假設是，一旦 Y 抽出籤，Y 的部分就屬於 Y 了。《義註》補充說，無論 X 的部分價值高於 Y 的價值、低於 Y 的價值，還是兩部分價值相等，這種交換都算是竊盜。</td>

<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu states that there is no penalty if the bhikkhu goes through customs not knowing that he has an item subject to import duties among his effects. The relevant cases show that this can mean one of two things: Either he knows that he has the item with him but not that it is subject to import duties; or he does not know that he has the item with him at all. The Commentary adds that if a bhikkhu informs the customs official that he has an item subject to import duties and yet the official decides not to collect the duty, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. It also states that if a bhikkhu goes through customs with a conditional intent—“If they ask to see my belongings, I’ll pay the fee, but if they wave me through I won’t”—then if the officials do wave him through without asking to see his belongings, he incurs no offense. At present, when people entering a country are asked to choose different passageways through a customs area, marked “Goods to declare” and “Nothing to declare,” a bhikkhu with goods to declare who enters the “Nothing to declare” passageway cannot take advantage of this allowance for conditional intent, as he has already indicated an unconditional intent through his choice of a passageway.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if, to avoid paying an import duty at a frontier, one crosses the frontier in such a way as to evade the customs area (§), one incurs only a dukkaṭa. At present, the civil law judges this sort of behavior as more reprehensible than slipping an item through customs, but from the point of view of the Vinaya the lesser penalty still holds. The Commentary says that this allowance applies only in cases when one evades the customs area by a distance of more than two leḍḍupātas—approximately 36 meters. (A leḍḍupāta is a unit of measure that appears frequently in the Canon and is defined as the distance a man of average stature can throw a clod of dirt underarm.)</td>
<td>《經分別》說，如果為了避免在邊境繳納進口關稅，而以逃避關稅區（§）的方式跨越邊境，則只會犯《突吉羅》。目前，民法認為這種行為比偷渡物品更應受到譴責，但從戒律的角度來看，仍應受到較輕的懲罰。《義註》稱，這項開緣僅適用於逃避海關區域距離超過 2 個 leḍḍupāta（約 36 公尺）的情況。（ <em>leḍḍupāta</em> 是一種在《聖典》中經常出現的測量單位，被定義為中等身材的人將一塊泥土用低手丟擲而出的距離。）</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga’s position here is important to understand, for it has implications concerning the extent to which the evasion of other government fees and taxes would fall under this rule. The underlying assumption here seems to be that a dutiable item carried into a customs area is impounded by the king (or government). The payment of the duty is thus an act of recovering full ownership of the item. An item carried across the frontier without entering the customs area would not count as impounded, even though the king would probably claim the right to impound or even confiscate it if his agents apprehended the smuggler. Translated into modern terms, this would indicate that the evasion of other taxes claimed by the government—such as inheritance taxes—would incur the full penalty here only if the item being taxed was impounded on government property, and one evaded the tax by taking the item out of impoundment without paying the required fee. Otherwise, the penalty for tax evasion would be a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>理解《經分別》在此的立場很重要，因為它涉及到逃避其他政府費用和稅收在多大程度上屬於此戒條的範圍。這裡的基本假設似乎是，帶入海關區域的應稅物品被國王（或政府）扣押。因此，繳納關稅是恢復該物品的全部所有權的行為。未進入海關區域而跨越邊境的物品不會被視為被扣押，儘管如果國王的特工逮捕了走私者，國王可能會聲稱有權扣押甚至沒收該物品。用現代術語來說，這表明，逃避政府徵收的其他稅款（例如遺產稅），只有當徵稅物品被扣押在政府財產上，並且在未繳納規定費用的情況下將物品從扣押中取出來逃稅時，才會受到全額懲罰。否則，對逃稅的懲罰是《突吉羅》。</td>

<tr><td>None of the texts discuss the question of contraband, i.e., articles that a customs official would confiscate outright rather than allow into a country after the payment of a fee. Apparently, such goods smuggled through a customs house would fall into this category, although—as even the payment of a fee would not legally get them through customs—their selling value would be the determining factor in calculating the seriousness of the offense.</td>
<td>這些文本都沒有討論違禁品問題，即海關官員在支付費用後會直接沒收而不是允許入境的物品。顯然，透過海關走私，即使支付費用也不能合法地通過海關的貨物屬於這一類，而它們的售價將成為計算犯戒嚴重性的決定性因素。</td>

Ajjuka sees that the nephew has the greater faith and so shows the place of the treasure to him. The nephew awards the Saṅgha with a large donation; the son accuses Ven.

Also, the taking in this case would be accomplished in line with the Vibhaṅga’s standard definition for <em>taking</em> with regard to the objects involved—and not necessarily when the cheated heir gives up trying to reclaim the inheritance—for in Ven.

The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu intends to steal some grass belonging to the Community but ends up setting fire to it instead, thus incurring a dukkaṭa. The Commentary notes that this ruling applies only because the bhikkhu did not move the grass from its place. What this means is that if he had first taken the grass from its place and then destroyed it in any way, the factor of effort under this rule would have been fulfilled and—all other factors of a pārājika offense being present—he would have been guilty of the full offense.</td>

<tr><td>As stated above, any case of stealing counts as an offense, but the gravity of the offense is determined by the value of the object. This is the point of the phrase in the rule reading, “just as when there is the taking of what is not given, kings… would banish him, saying… ‘You are a thief.’” In other words, for a theft to entail a pārājika it must be a criminal case, which in the time of the Buddha meant that the goods involved were worth at least five <em>māsakas</em>, a unit of money used at the time. Goods valued collectively at more than one māsaka but less than five are grounds for a thullaccaya; goods valued collectively at one māsaka or less, grounds for a dukkaṭa. As the Commentary notes, the value of the articles is determined by the price they would have fetched at the time and place of the theft. As stated above, in the case of smuggling the Vibhaṅga measures the value of the object, for the purpose of this rule, as the duty owed on it, not the value of the object itself.</td>
<td>如上所述，任何偷竊行為都被視為犯戒，但犯戒的嚴重程度取決於對象物品的價值。這就是戒條中這句話的要點，「就像當有人拿取未給予的東西時，國王......會驅逐他，說......『你是一個小偷。』」換句話說，竊盜行為涉及《波羅夷》的，一定是刑事犯罪案件，在佛陀時代，這意味著所涉及的貨物至少價值 5 <em>摩沙迦</em>（當時使用的貨幣單位）。總價值超過 1 摩沙迦但低於 5 摩沙迦的商品，犯《偷蘭遮》；總價值為 1 摩沙迦或更低的商品，犯《突吉羅》。正如《義註》指出的那樣，物品的價值取決於它們在被偷的時間和地點的售價。如上所述，在走私的情況下，就本戒條而言，《經分別》是以對其所徵收的關稅作為物品的價值，而不是物品本身的價值。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This leaves us with the question of how a māsaka would translate into current monetary rates. No one can answer this question with any certainty, for the oldest attempt to peg the māsaka to the gold standard dates from the V/Sub-commentary, which sets one māsaka as equal to 4 rice grains’ weight of gold. At this rate, the theft of an item worth 20 rice grains’ (1/24 troy ounce) weight of gold or more would be a pārājika offense.</td>
<td>這給我們留下了一個問題：摩沙迦如何轉換為當前的貨幣利率。沒有人能夠肯定地回答這個問題，因為將摩沙迦與金本位掛鉤的最古老的嘗試可以追溯到V/《複註》，其中將 1 摩沙迦等於 4 粒米重的黃金。按照這個利率，偷竊價值 20 粒米（1/24 <a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E8%A1%A1%E7%9B%8E%E5%8F%B8">金衡盎司</a>）黃金或更高將構成《波羅夷》罪。</td>

<tr><td>One objection to this method of calculation is that some of the items mentioned in the Vinīta-vatthu as grounds for a pārājika when stolen—e.g., a pillow, a bundle of laundry, a raft, a handful of rice during a famine—would seem to be worth much less than 1/24 troy ounce of gold. However, we must remember that many items regarded as commonplace now may have been viewed as expensive luxuries at the time.</td>
<td>對這種計算方法的一個反對意見是，《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中提到的一些被偷時作為《波羅夷》依據的物品——例如，一個枕頭、一捆衣物、一艘木筏、飢荒期間的一把米——其價值似乎遠低於 1/24 金衡盎司黃金。然而，我們必須記住，許多現在被認為司空見慣的物品在當時可能被視為昂貴的奢侈品。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition, there is one very good reason for adopting the standard set by the V/Sub-commentary: It sets a high value for the least article whose theft would result in a pārājika. Thus when a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, there can be no doubt that he has committed the full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be inescapable doubt—and when there is any doubt concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt: He is not expelled. A basic principle operating throughout the texts is that it is better to risk letting an offender go unpunished than to risk punishing an innocent bhikkhu.</td>
<td>此外，採用V/《複註》設定的標準還有一個很好的理由：它為偷竊會導致《波羅夷》的最少物品設定了很高的價值。因此，當比丘偷竊價值 1/24 金衡盎司黃金或更高的物品時，毫無疑問他已經完全違犯此戒。當物品的價值較低時，就會不可避免地產生懷疑——當對《波羅夷》有任何疑問時，戒律的傳統始終給予比丘以懷疑的好處：他不會被驅逐。貫穿整個文本的一個基本原則是，冒著讓犯戒者不受懲罰的風險，比冒著懲罰無辜比丘的風險要好。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is a second advantage to the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation: its precision and clarity. Some people have recommended adopting the standard expressed in the rule itself—that if the theft would result in flogging, imprisonment, or banishment by the authorities in that time and at that place, then the theft would constitute a pārājika—but this standard creates more problems than it would solve. In most countries the sentence is largely at the discretion of the judge or magistrate, and the factor of value is only one among many taken into account when determining the penalty. This opens a whole Pandora’s box of issues, many of which have nothing to do with the bhikkhu or the object he has taken—the judge’s mood, his social philosophy, his religious background, and so forth—issues that the Buddha never allowed to enter into the consideration of how to determine the penalty for a theft.</td>
<td>V/《複註》的計算方法還有第二個優點：精確、清晰。有些人建議採用戒條本身所表達的標準，即如果偷竊行為會導致當時該地點的當局鞭打、監禁或流放，那麼該偷竊行為就構成《波羅夷》，但這一標準產生的問題多於其解決的問題。在大多數國家，刑罰很大程度上由法官或治安官酌情決定，價值因素只是決定刑罰時考慮的眾多因素之一。這就打開了整個潘朵拉魔盒的問題，其中許多問題與比丘或他所拿取的對象物品無關——法官的情緒、他的社會哲學、他的宗教背景等等——佛陀從未允許在對竊盜罪的刑罰如何確定時考慮的問題。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation has the benefits that it is a quick and easy method for determining the boundaries between the different levels of offense in any modern currency; it involves no factors extraneous to the tradition of the Vinaya, and—as noted above—it draws the line at a value above which there can be no doubt that the penalty is a pārājika.</td>
<td>因此，V/《複註》的計算方法的優點是，它是一種快速、簡單的方法，可以確定任何現代貨幣的不同犯戒程度之間的界限；它不涉及與戒律傳統無關的因素，而且——如上所述——它劃定了一個價值，高於這個價值，毫無疑問，懲罰就是《波羅夷》。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, arguing from two cases in the Vinīta-vatthu, states that if a bhikkhu steals several items on different occasions, the values of the different items are added together to determine the severity of the offense <em>only if they were stolen as part of a single plan or intention.</em> If they are stolen as a result of separate intentions, each act of stealing is treated as a separate offense whose severity depends on the value of the individual item(s) stolen in that act.

<tr><td>The commentaries state that when a heavier penalty is incurred in offenses of this sort, only that penalty is counted, and the preceding lighter ones are nullified. They derive this principle from a passage in the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">Sg 10-13</a> and, using the Great Standards, apply it to all the rules. Thus, for example, if a bhikkhu trying to steal a book simply touches it, he incurs a string of dukkaṭas for each step in walking up to the book and taking hold of it. If he budges the book slightly but not so much as to move it completely from its place, the dukkaṭas are nullified and replaced with a thullaccaya. If he actually takes the book, that nullifies the thullaccaya and replaces it with a pārājika.</td>
<td>註釋指出，此類犯戒僅計算受到的較重懲罰，之前較輕的懲罰無效。他們從<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">《僧殘》十到十三</a>的《經分別》中的一段經文中得出這一原則，並使用《四大教示》，將其應用於所有戒條。因此，舉例來說，如果一個比丘試圖偷一本書，僅僅只是觸碰它，那麼他走到這本書並抓住它的每一步，犯一連串《突吉羅》。如果他稍微移動這本書，但又沒有完全移動它的位置，那麼《突吉羅》就會失效，並被《偷蘭遮》取代。如果他真的拿走了這本書，那麼《偷蘭遮》就會失效，並以《波羅夷》取而代之。</td>

<tr><td>There is some question, though, as to whether the compilers of the Canon intended the passage under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">Sg 10-13</a> to be taken as a general principle. They don’t mention it under any of the other saṅghādisesa rules or in the otherwise parallel passage in the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc68">Pc 68</a>. Thus, the principle seems intended only for those four rules. To be on the strict side, it seems best to say that, unless otherwise noted, a bhikkhu who completes an act must make amends for all the offenses incurred in leading up to it. Under the pārājika rules this is a moot point, for once the pārājika is committed the offender is no longer a bhikkhu. But under the lesser rules this principle is still relevant.</td>
<td>然而，關於《聖典》的編撰者是否打算將<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">《僧殘》十到十三</a>中的段落視為一般原則，存在一些疑問。他們沒有在任何其他《僧殘》戒條下或在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc68">《波逸提》六八</a>的《經分別》其他類似的段落中提及它。因此，該原則似乎僅適用於這四個戒條。從嚴格的角度來看，最好的說法是，除非另有說明，完成某一行為的比丘必須彌補在該行為之前所造成的所有罪過。根據《波羅夷》戒條，這是一個有爭議的問題，因為一旦犯了《波羅夷》，犯戒者就不再是比丘了。但在較小的戒條下，這項原則仍然適用。</td>

<tr><td>As for the derived offenses related to the factor of perception, these deal with the situation in which an article does not qualify as not given under this rule—e.g., it has no owner, or the owner has given it up or thrown it away—and yet the bhikkhu perceives it as not given. If he takes it with intent to steal, he incurs a dukkaṭa for each of the three stages of effort. In the case of an object that can be stolen by moving it from its place, these would be: touching the object, making it budge, moving it from its place. A similar set of offenses would apply in the stages appropriate for taking any of the other types of objects listed above.</td>
<td>至於與感知因素有關的衍生違犯，這些涉及的是不符合本戒條規定的物品的情況，例如，該物品沒有所有者，或者所有者已將其放棄或扔掉——然而比丘認為它沒有被給予。如果他出於偷竊的目的而取走它，他會因三個階段中每一階段的努力而犯一次《突吉羅》。如果物品可以透過將其從原來的位置移開而被偷，則這些階段將是：觸摸該物體，使其移動，將其移離原來的位置。類似的犯戒行為將適用於拿取上述任何其他類型物品的適當階段。</td>

<tr><td>If there is any confusion in carrying out the instructions—e.g., if the accomplice, instead of taking the object specified by the instigator, takes something else instead; or if he is told to take it in the afternoon but instead takes it in the morning—the instigator incurs only the penalties for proposing the theft and persuading the accomplice, and not the penalty for the theft itself. The same holds true if the instigator rescinds his order before the theft takes place, but the accomplice goes ahead and takes the object anyway.</td>
<td>如果在執行指示時出現任何混亂，例如，如果共犯沒有拿走教唆者指定的物品，而是拿走了其他東西；或者如果他被告知在下午取走，而在早上取走，則教唆者僅因提出偷竊行為並說服共犯而受到懲罰，而不會因偷竊本身而受到懲罰。如果教唆者在偷竊發生前撤銷命令，但共犯卻繼續拿走物品，情況也是如此。</td>

Conversely, if B takes X, thinking it to be Y, A is guilty of the theft.</td>
<td>《義註》還補充說，偷竊者的感知因素並不影響懲罰。換句話說，如果比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 偷東西 X，而 B 認為 Y 是 X，就拿走了 Y，那麼 A 就免除了偷竊的任何責任。相反，如果 B 拿走了 X，並認為它是 Y，則 A 犯有偷竊罪。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga also notes that if an instigator tells his accomplice to take an item when he (the instigator) makes a sign—such as winking (§) his eye, lifting his eyebrow, or lifting his head—he incurs a dukkaṭa in making this order, a thullaccaya if the accomplice agrees to do as told, and the full offense when the accomplice actually takes the item at the time of the sign. If the accomplice takes the item before or after the sign, though, the instigator incurs no offense. The Sub-commentary, noting that the signs mentioned in the Vibhaṅga are so fleeting that it would be impossible to take the item at the very moment of the sign, interprets this last statement as follows: If the accomplice starts trying to take the item right after the sign, then regardless of how much time that takes, it counts as “at the time of the sign.” Only if he makes an appreciable delay before attempting the theft does it count as “after the sign.”</td>
<td>《經分別》還指出，如果教唆者告訴他的共犯在他（教唆者）做出示意動作時拿走一件物品——例如眨眼（§）、揚起眉毛或抬起頭——他會在做這個命令動作時犯《突吉羅》，如果共犯同意按照指示行事，則為《偷蘭遮》；如果共犯在示意動作時實際拿走了該物品，則構成完全犯戒。不過，如果共犯在示意動作之前或之後拿走物品，教唆者不犯戒。《複註》指出，《經分別》中提到的示意動作是如此短暫，以至於不可能在示意動作出現的那一刻拿走該物品，因此對最後的陳述解釋如下：如果共犯在示意動作之後開始試圖拿走該物品，無論花費多少時間，都算是「示意動作時」。只有當他在嘗試偷竊之前明顯延遲時，才算作「在示意動作之後」。</td>

Once D takes the object as instructed, all four incur the penalty coming from the theft. If there is any confusion in the chain of command—e.g., Bhikkhu B instead of telling C tells D directly—neither A nor C incurs the penalty for the theft itself. Bhikkhu A would incur a dukkaṭa for telling B, whereas C would incur no penalty at all.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，如果存在涉及兩個或更多比丘（不包括教唆者）的指揮鏈——例如，比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 告訴比丘 C 告訴比丘 D 實施偷竊——那麼當 D 同意實施偷竊時，教唆者犯《偷蘭遮》。一旦 D 依照指示取走物品，四人都會因偷竊而受到懲罰。如果指揮鏈中存在任何混亂，例如，比丘 B 沒有告訴 C，而是直接告訴 D，那麼 A 和 C 都不會因為偷竊本身而受到懲罰。比丘 A 會因告訴 B 而犯《突吉羅》，而 C 則不會受到任何懲罰。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes that the instigator in any of these cases incurs the penalty only if he gives an explicit command to take the item (although this statement has to be qualified to include signs meant as commands, as mentioned above). If he simply tells his accomplice that such-and-such an item is located in such-and-such a place and would be easy to steal, he incurs no penalty even if the accomplice actually commits the theft. This point applies to many of the rules in which giving a command to do an action that would break the rule would also fulfill the factor of effort: A statement counts as a command only if it is a clear imperative to do the action. Under the few rules where this is <em>not</em> the case, we will note the exception.</td>
<td>《義註》指出，在任何這些情況下，教唆者只有在明確命令拿走該物品時才會受到懲罰（儘管此陳述也包括意味著命令的示意動作，如上所述）。如果他只是告訴共犯，某某物品位於某某地方，很容易偷竊，即使共犯確實實施了偷竊行為，他也不會受到懲罰。這一點適用於許多戒條，在這些戒條中，發出命令執行違反戒條的行動也將滿足努力因素：只有當明確要求執行某項行動時，該語句才算是命令。在情況<em>並非</em>如此的少數戒條，我們將註明例外情況。</td>

<tr><td>None of the texts mention the scenario in which Bhikkhu A tells Bhikkhu B to take an item for him without letting B know that he is committing a theft—for instance, telling B that the item belongs to him (A), that it is ownerless, or letting B come to either conclusion on his own. Nevertheless, it would appear that if B then actually takes the item as told, all of the factors for an offense would be fulfilled for A: He gives the command to take (the imperative the Vibhaṅga uses in illustrating commands to “steal”—<em>avahara</em>—can also simply mean to “take”), he knows that the item belongs to someone else, he intends to have it taken, and it is taken as a result of his command. As for B, he would not be committing an offense, as his state of mind would not fulfill the factors of perception and intention for a theft.</td>
<td>沒有任何文本提到這樣的場景：比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 為他拿走一件物品，但不讓 B 知道他正在偷竊，例如，告訴 B 該物品屬於他（A），或它是無主的，或者讓 B 自己得出兩者中任一結論。然而，看起來如果 B 實際上按照所告知的那樣拿走了該物品，那麼 A 就滿足了所有犯戒因素：他發出了拿走的命令（《經分別》在解釋「偷竊」命令時使用的祈使語氣—— <em>avahara</em> ——也可以只表示「拿走」），他知道該物品屬於其他人，他打算拿走它，並且由於他的命令而被拿走。至於 B，他不犯戒，因為他的心理狀態不符合偷竊的感知和意圖因素。</td>

According to the Commentary, any bhikkhus who assist a bhikkhu in a fraudulent case also incur the same offense he does: a pārājika if he wins, a thullaccaya if he loses.

Saṅgha property thus counts as “what is not given” as far as individual bhikkhus are concerned, for it has an owner—the Saṅgha of all times and places—and is guarded by the individual Community of bhikkhus.</td>

At most, such items may be taken on loan or exchanged—with the approval of the Community—for other heavy property of equal value. A bhikkhu who gives such items away to anyone—ordained or not—perceiving it as his to give, incurs a thullaccaya no matter what the value of the object (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#Cv.VI.15.2">Cv.VI.15.2</a>—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0046.html#BMC2chapter7">BMC2, Chapter 7</a>).

The Buddha, in judging the case, states that they committed no offense as they were taking the fruit just for their own consumption. This implies that if they were to take the fruit for other purposes—to have it sold, for instance—they would be guilty of an offense. The Commentary adds that visiting bhikkhus have this right only if the resident bhikkhus are not caring for the fruit trees, if the trees had not been donated to provide funds for a particular purpose in the monastery, or if the resident bhikkhus eat from the trees as if they alone were the owners and are not willing to share. In other words, the visiting bhikkhus, as a matter of courtesy, should ask the residents first. If the residents share, one may take what they offer. If they don’t, and the trees are not dedicated to another purpose, one may take just enough for one’s own consumption. The Commentary also adds that if the monastery is vacant, one may go ahead and take the fruit, for it is meant for all bhikkhus who come.</td>

<tr><td><em>Deceit.</em> If a bhikkhu uses a deliberate lie to deceive another person into giving an item to him, the transgression is treated not as a case of stealing—because, after all, the item is given to him—but rather as a case of lying.

In all of these cases, the penalty is a pācittiya for lying under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>.</td>
<td><em>欺詐。</em>如果比丘故意撒謊，欺騙他人給他某樣東西，那麼這種犯戒行為就不會被視為偷竊—因為畢竟該物品是被給予他的—而是被視為撒謊。如果謊言涉及虛假聲稱具有卓越的修行成就，則根據<a class="reference external" href="#pr4">《波羅夷》四</a>進行處理。如果不是，則根據<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>進行處理。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》給出了七個案例：五個案例中，在僧團中分發必需品期間，比丘為不存在的比丘索取額外的一份，並得到了額外的一份；另兩個案例，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0088a04">一位比丘尼接近她老師的在家供養者並索取藥物，並說這些藥物是給她老師的</a>，儘管最終她自己使用了這些藥物。在所有這些案例下，根據<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>，說謊的懲罰是《波逸提》。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, in its discussion of the bhikkhus taking an extra portion for a non-existent bhikkhu, insists that the penalty for lying applies only to cases where donors have already given the requisites to the Community. If, prior to their giving the requisites to the Community, a bhikkhu asks them directly for a portion for a non-existent bhikkhu, the Commentary says that he has committed a theft under this rule. This, however, contradicts the ruling in the two cases involving the bhikkhunī, who asks directly from the donor. Thus it would appear that in any case where a bhikkhu obtains an article from a donor through deceit, the penalty would be the pācittiya for lying.</td>
<td>《義註》在討論比丘為一個不存在的比丘收取額外的份額時，堅持認為撒謊的懲罰只適用於布施者已經向僧團給予必需品的情況。如果在向僧團給予必需品之前，一位比丘直接向他們索取一位不存在的比丘的份額，《義註》說根據這條戒條，他犯了偷竊。然而，這與涉及直接向施主索取的比丘尼的兩起案例的裁決相矛盾。因此，在任何情況下看來，當比丘透過欺詐手段從施主那裡獲得物品時，懲罰是因說謊的《波逸提》。</td>

<tr><td>The question arises, what about a bhikkhu who, given an item to take to someone else, originally plans to take it to the intended recipient but later changes his mind? It does not seem right to impose a heavier penalty on him than on a person who uses deceit to get the item to begin with, so it seems best to impose on him the dukkaṭa for a broken promise (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.III.14.4">Mv.III.14.1-14</a>—see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>).

<tr><td><em>Receiving stolen goods.</em> Accepting a gift of goods or purchasing them very cheaply, knowing that they were stolen, would in Western criminal law result in a penalty similar to stealing itself. However, neither the Canon nor the commentaries mention this case. The closest they come is in the Vinīta-vatthu, where a groundskeeper gives bhikkhus fruit from the orchard under his care, even though it was not his to give, and there was no offense for the bhikkhus. From this it can be inferred that there is no offense for receiving stolen goods, even knowingly, although a bhikkhu who does so would not be exempt from the civil law and the consequent proceedings, in the course of which the Community would probably urge him to disrobe.</td>
<td><em>收受贓物。</em>在西方刑法中，接受商品禮物或以非常便宜的價格購買商品，而且明知這些商品是被偷的，將導致與偷竊本身類似的懲罰。然而，《聖典》和註釋均未提及此種情況。最接近的地方是在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0086a14">園丁從他照管的果園裡給予比丘們水果</a>，儘管這不是他的，卻仍給予比丘們，而比丘們並沒有犯戒。由此可以推斷，收受贓物並不構成犯戒，即使在知情的情況下，儘管這樣做的比丘不能免於民法和隨後的訴訟，在此過程中，僧團可能會敦促他還俗。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Compensation owed.</em> The Commentary introduces the concept of <em>bhaṇḍadeyya</em>, or compensation owed, to cover cases where a bhikkhu is responsible for the loss or destruction of another person’s property. It defines this concept by saying that the bhikkhu must pay the price of the object to the owner or give the owner another object of equal value to the one lost or destroyed; if the bhikkhu does not give compensation, and the owner gives up his/her efforts to receive compensation, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika. The Commentary applies this concept not only to cases where the bhikkhu knowingly and intentionally destroys the object, but also to cases where he borrows or agrees to look after something that then gets lost, stolen, or destroyed through his negligence; or where he takes an item mistakenly thinking that it was discarded or that he was in a position to take it on trust.</td>
<td><em>所欠賠償。</em>《義註》引入了 <em>bhaṇḍadeyya</em> （所欠賠償）的概念，以涵蓋比丘對他人財產的損失或毀壞負責的情況。它定義了這個概念，說比丘必須向所有者支付該物品的價格，或向所有者提供與丟失或毀壞的物品價值相同的另一件物品；如果比丘不給予補償，並且所有者放棄了獲得補償的努力，那麼比丘就會犯《波羅夷》。《義註》不僅將這個概念應用於比丘明知而故意毀壞物品的情況，也適用於他借用或同意看管某物，但由於他的疏忽而丟失、被盜或毀壞的情況；或者他拿走一件物品時，誤認為該物品已被丟棄，或他可以基於信任拿走該物品。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>To cite a few examples: A bhikkhu breaks another person’s jar of oil or places excrement in the oil to spoil it. A bhikkhu charged with guarding the Community storeroom lets a group of other bhikkhus into the storeroom to fetch belongings they have left there; they forget to close the door and, before he remembers to check it, thieves slip in to steal things. A group of thieves steal a bundle of mangoes but, being chased by the owners, drop it and run; a bhikkhu sees the mangoes, thinks that they have been thrown away, and so eats them after getting someone to present them to him. A bhikkhu sees a wild boar caught in a trap and, out of compassion, sets it free but cannot reconcile the owner of the trap to what he has done. In each of these cases, the Commentary says, the bhikkhu in question owes compensation to the owner of the goods. (In the case of the mangoes, he must compensate not only the owners but also the thieves if it turns out that they had planned to come back and fetch the fruit.) If he abandons his responsibility to the owner(s), he incurs a pārājika.</td>
<td>舉幾個例子：一位比丘打碎了別人的油罐，或是把排泄物放入油中，毀掉了油。一位負責看守僧團儲藏室的比丘讓一群其他比丘進入儲藏室取回他們留在那裡的所有物；他們忘記關門，在他記得檢查之前，小偷就溜進來偷東西了。一群小偷偷了一捆芒果，但被所有者追趕，丟下逃跑；一位比丘看到芒果，以為它們已被丟掉，於是請人將芒果手授給他後吃掉它們。一位比丘看到一頭野豬被困在陷阱中，出於慈悲，將其釋放，但無法讓陷阱的主人接受他的所作所為。《義註》說，在上述每一種情況下，相關比丘都欠貨物所有者賠償。（就芒果而言，他不僅必須賠償所有者，而且如果發現竊賊計劃回來取芒果，他也必須賠償竊賊。）如果他放棄對所有者（們）的責任，他就會犯《波羅夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In making these judgments, the Commentary is probably following the civil law of its day, for the Canon contains no reference at all to the concept of bhaṇḍadeyya, and some of its judgments contradict the Commentary’s. As we noted above, the Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu breaks, scatters, burns, or otherwise renders unusable the property of another person, he incurs a dukkaṭa. When the Vinīta-vatthu discusses cases where a bhikkhu takes an item on mistaken assumptions, or where he feels compassion for an animal caught in a trap and so sets it free, it says that there is no offense. Thus it seems strange for the Commentary to assign a pārājika to an action that, according to the Canon, carries a dukkaṭa or no penalty at all. Of course, it would be a generous policy to offer the owner reasonable compensation, but it is by no means certain that a bhikkhu would have the wherewithal or liberty to do so. Because the Canon does not allow a bhikkhu to ask his supporters for donations to pay to another lay person—except for his parents (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Mv.VIII.22.1">Mv.VIII.22</a>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">BMC2, Chapter 10</a>)—there is no way a bhikkhu could raise the needed funds. The Canon places only one responsibility on a bhikkhu who causes material loss to a lay person: The Community, if it sees fit, can force him to apologize to the owner (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#Cv.I.20">Cv.I.20</a>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">BMC2, Chapter 20</a>). Beyond that, the Canon does not require that he make material compensation of any kind. Thus, as the Commentary’s concept of bhaṇḍadeyya is clearly foreign to the Canon, there seems no reason to adopt it.</td>
<td>在做出這些判斷時，《義註》可能遵循了當時的民法，因為《聖典》根本沒有提到 bhaṇḍadeyya 的概念，而且它的一些判斷與《義註》的判斷相矛盾。正如我們上面提到的，《經分別》指出，如果比丘破壞、散落、焚燒或以其他方式使他人的財產無法使用，他犯《突吉羅》。當《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》討論比丘因錯誤的假設而拿走一件物品，或者他對被困在陷阱中的動物感到同情並因此將其釋放的情況時，它說沒有犯戒。因此，根據《聖典》，《義註》為一項犯《突吉羅》或根本沒有犯戒的行為指定了《波羅夷》的懲罰，這似乎很奇怪。當然，為所有者提供合理的補償是一項慷慨之舉，但無法確定比丘是否有足夠的資金或自由這樣做。因為《聖典》不允許比丘向他的支持者索要捐款來支付給另一個在家人——除了他的父母（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0386a05">《大品》.八.22</a>；見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第十章</a>）——所以比丘不可能籌集到所需的資金。《聖典》只規定對在家人造成物質損失的比丘承擔一項責任：如果僧團認為合適，可以強迫他向所有者道歉（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_011#0024a12">《小品》.一.20</a>；參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章</a>）。除此之外，《聖典》並沒有要求他做出任何形式的物質補償。因此，由於《義註》中的 bhaṇḍadeyya 概念對於正典來說顯然是不相干的，似乎沒有理由採用它。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Enforcement of rules.</em> There is one important area in which even the Commentary does not require compensation, and that is when a bhikkhu sees another bhikkhu using an inappropriate object and arranges to have it destroyed. Here the Commentary draws its argument from the origin story to this rule, in which the Buddha orders the bhikkhus to destroy an inappropriately made hut—a “potter’s hut,” which was made from earth and then fired like a pot. From this example, the Commentary draws the following judgment: If a bhikkhu starts to build an inappropriate hut in a certain territory, the “owners” of the territory (i.e., the resident senior bhikkhus) should tell him to stop. If he does not heed their decision and actually builds the hut there, then when they are able to assemble a sufficient number of righteous bhikkhus, the resident senior bhikkhus can send him an order to remove it. If, after the order has been sent three times, the hut is still not removed, the bhikkhus are to dismantle it in such a way that the materials can be reused. The original builder is then to be told to remove the materials. If he doesn’t, then the resident bhikkhus are not responsible for any loss or damage they may undergo.</td>
<td><em>戒條的執行。</em>有一個重要的領域，在該領域甚至連《義註》也不要求賠償，那就是當一位比丘看到另一位比丘使用不適當的物品並安排將其銷毀時。在此，《義註》從這一戒條起源故事推引出論據，其中佛陀命令比丘摧毀一座不恰當建造的小屋（孤邸）——一座“陶工的小屋”，它是用泥土製成的，然後像鍋一樣燒製。從這個例子，《義註》得出如下判斷：如果一個比丘開始在某個地區建造不合適的小屋，該地區的「主人」（即常住的長老）應該叫他停止。如果他不聽從他們的決定，真的在那裡建造了小屋，那麼當他們能夠聚集足夠數量的正直比丘時，常住的長老就可以命令他拆除它。如果命令發出三次後，小屋仍未拆除，比丘們應將其拆除，以便材料可以重新使用。然後，原建築者將被告知移除這些材料。如果他不這樣做，那麼居住的比丘們對可能遭受的任何損失或損害不負有責任。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary then derives a further principle from this example to say that if Bhikkhu X, who is knowledgeable in the Vinaya, sees Bhikkhu Y using inappropriate requisites of any sort, he is entitled to get them destroyed or reduced to an appropriate form. He is also not obligated to compensate Y for any loss or inconvenience incurred.</td>
<td>然後，《義註》從這個例子中得出進一步的原則，即如果精通戒律的 X 比丘看到 Y 比丘使用任何種類的不適當的必需品，他有權將它們銷毀或簡化為適當的形式。他也沒有義務賠償 Y 所遭受的任何損失或不便。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Court actions.</em> As stated above, if a bhikkhu knowingly starts an unfair court case against someone else and then wins it in the final court to which the accused makes appeal, he incurs a pārājika. The Commentary to the Bhikkhunīs’ <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bhikkhuni-pati.html#sg">Sg 1</a>, however, states that even if a bhikkhu is actually mistreated by someone—defamed, physically injured, robbed, etc.—and then tries to take a just court action against the guilty party, he incurs a pārājika if he wins. Again, this is an instance where the Commentary has no support from the Canon and, as the Vinaya-mukha points out, its assertion cannot stand. However, the training of a bhikkhu requires that he view all losses in the light of kamma and focus on looking after the state of his mind rather than on seeking compensation in social or material terms.</td>
<td><em>法庭訴訟。</em>如上所述，如果一個比丘故意向他人提起不公平的法庭訴訟，然後在被告提出上訴的最終法庭中勝訴，他犯《波羅夷》。然而，比丘尼<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_010#0304a05">《僧殘》一</a>的《義註》指出，即使比丘實際上受到某人的虐待——誹謗、身體傷害、搶劫等——然後試圖對有罪方採取公正的法庭行動，如果他贏了，他犯《波羅夷》。再一次，這是《義註》沒有得到《聖典》支持的例子，並且正如《戒律入口》所指出的那樣，它的主張是站不住腳的。然而，比丘的訓練要求他從業的角度看待所有損失，並專注於照顧自己的心態，而不是尋求社會或物質方面的補償。</td>

<tr><td>There is no question in any of the texts that if a bhikkhu is asked to give evidence in a courtroom and does so, speaking in accordance with the facts, he commits no offense no matter what the outcome for the others involved.

<tr><td><em>Infringement of copyright.</em> The international standards for copyright advocated by UNESCO state that infringement of copyright is tantamount to theft. However, in practice, an accusation of copyright infringement is judged not as a case of theft but as one of “fair use,” the issue being the extent to which a person in possession of an item may fairly copy that item for his/her own use or to give or sell to another person without compensating the copyright owner. Thus even a case of “unfair use” would not fulfill the factors of effort and object under this rule, in that—in creating a copy—one is not taking possession of an item that does not belong to one, and one is not depriving the owners of something already theirs. At most, the copyright owners might claim that they are being deprived of compensation owed to them, but as we have argued above, the principle of compensation owed does not rightly belong under this rule. In the terminology of the Canon, a case of unfair use would fall under either of two categories—acting for the material loss of the copyright owners or wrong livelihood—categories that entail a dukkaṭa under the general rule against misbehavior (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Cv.V.36">Cv.V.36</a>). They would also make one eligible for a disciplinary transaction, such as reconciliation or banishment (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">BMC2, Chapter 20</a>), which the Community could impose if it saw the infringement as serious enough to merit such a punishment.</td>
<td><em>侵犯版權。</em>聯合國教科文組織所倡導的版權國際標準規定，侵害著作權等同於偷竊。然而，在實踐中，侵犯版權的指控不是被視為偷竊案件，而是被視為「合理使用」案件，問題在於擁有某項物品的人可以在多大程度上合理地為自己使用複製該物品，或在不補償版權所有者的情況下贈送或出售給他人。因此，即使是「不合理使用」的情況也不能滿足此戒條下的努力和對象因素，因為在建立拷貝時，並沒有佔有不屬於自己的物品，並且也沒有剝奪所有者已經屬於他們的東西。至多，版權所有者可能聲稱自己被剝奪了應得的賠償，但正如我們上面所論證的，所欠賠償原則不屬於本戒條的範疇。在《聖典》的術語中，不合理使用的案件屬於兩種類別中的任何一種—為版權所有者的物質損失而採取行動或邪命—根據禁止不當行為的一般戒條，這兩種類別意味著《突吉羅》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_015#0190a11">《小品》.五.36</a>）。它們還將使一個人符合接受治罪羯磨的條件，例如下意或驅出（參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章</a>），如果僧團認為侵犯嚴重到足以值得受到這樣的懲罰，則可以實施之。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Copying computer software.</em> The agreement made when installing software on a computer, by which one agrees not to give the software to anyone else, comes under contract law. As such, a breach of that contract would be treated under the category of “deceit,” described above, which means that a bhikkhu who gives software to a friend in defiance of this contract would incur the penalty for a broken promise. As for the friend—assuming that he is a bhikkhu—the act of receiving the software and putting it on his computer would be treated under the precedent, mentioned above, of the bhikkhus receiving fruit from an orchard groundkeeper not authorized to give it away: He would incur no offense. However, as he must agree to the contract before installing the software on his computer, he would incur a penalty for a broken promise if he then gave the software to someone else in defiance of the contract.</td>
<td><em>複製電腦軟體。</em>在電腦上安裝軟體時達成的協議，即同意不將該軟體提供給其他任何人的協議，受合約法管轄。因此，違反該合約將被視為上述「欺詐」類別，這意味著違反該合約而向朋友提供軟體的比丘將因違背承諾而受到懲罰。至於朋友——假設他是比丘——接收軟體並將其放入他的電腦的行為將按照上述比丘從未經授權贈送水果的果園管理員那裡接收水果的先例來處理：他不會犯任何戒。然而，由於他在電腦上安裝軟體之前必須同意合約，如果他隨後違反合約將軟體提供給其他人，他將面臨違背承諾的懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Credit cards.</em> The theft of a credit card would of course be an offense. Because the owner of the card, in most cases, would not be required to pay for the stolen card, the seriousness of a theft of this sort would be determined by how the thief used the card. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP20">NP 20</a> would forbid a bhikkhu from using a credit card to buy anything even if the card were his to use, although a bhikkhu who had gone to the extent of stealing a card would probably not be dissuaded by that rule from using it or having someone else use it for him. In any event, the use of the card would be equivalent to using a stolen key to open a safe. If the thief hands the credit card to a store clerk to make a purchase, that would count as a gesture telling the clerk to transfer funds from the account of the credit card company. Because such operations are automated, the clerk’s attempt to have the funds transferred would count not as an act of deceit but an act of taking.

In the second, a bhikkhu with clairvoyant powers gains a vision of Sakka, the king of the devas, who is wearing an expensive cloth. The bhikkhu takes the cloth with the intention of making a robe for himself, even though Sakka keeps screaming, “Don’t take it! Don’t take it!” This latter example may have been included in the Commentary simply for its shock value in order to wake up sleepy students in the back of the room.

The Commentary states that if the bhikkhu finds out that the object does indeed have an owner, he owes the owner compensation and would be guilty of an offense when the owner abandons his efforts to gain that compensation. As we have already noted, the concept of compensation owed has no basis in the Canon, but if the object still lies in the bhikkhu’s possession and he decides not to return it, that decision would count as a thieving intention. The theft of the object could then be treated under the category of a borrowed object, which in practice has the same effect as the Commentary’s notion of compensation owed: The theft would be accomplished when the owner abandons his/her efforts to regain possession. However, if the object no longer exists (it was consumed by the bhikkhu or destroyed) or is no longer in the bhikkhu’s possession (he lost it or gave it away), the resolution of the issue is purely an individual matter between the bhikkhu and the owner, although as we noted above, the Community, if it sees fit, could force the bhikkhu to apologize to the owner.</td>

<tr><td>As for taking an item temporarily, the Commentary says this means taking it with the intention that (a) “I’ll return it” or (b) “I’ll make compensation.” There is support in the Vibhaṅga for including (a) here, but none for (b). If the Commentary included (b) to cover cases where a bhikkhu borrows an object but then happens to lose or destroy it, there is no need to include it, for as we have already explained, a bhikkhu is under no compulsion to compensate people for items lost or destroyed. If the Commentary meant it to cover cases where a bhikkhu takes ownership of an object belonging to a person with whom he has not established trust and with whom he plans to discuss compensation later, it doesn’t really fit under this exemption, for one is taking permanent possession of the item. Given the strict conditions that the Canon places on the exemption for taking an item on trust, it seems unlikely that its compilers would have countenanced an exemption for a bhikkhu to go around imposing unilateral trades, taking possession of items on the unfounded assumption that the owners would gladly accept compensation at a later time. If there is any place for this sort of exemption in the Vibhaṅga’s framework, it would be as a variant on taking on trust. Thus it would have to meet the following factors: The owner is an acquaintance or an intimate or has spoken of the matter; he/she is still alive; and one knows that he/she would be pleased if one takes the item and gives compensation later.</td>

If a bhikkhu without psychic powers happens to learn of the whereabouts of stolen goods, kidnapped children, etc., he may inform the authorities, if he sees fit, and let them handle the situation themselves.

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines the factor of intention in three contexts—the word-analysis, the non-offense clauses, and the Vinīta-vatthu—analyzing it with one set of terms in the first context, and another set in the last two. There are two ways of interpreting the discrepancy: Either the two sets differ only in language but not in substance, or they actually differ in substance. The Commentary, without seeming to notice what it is doing, adopts the second interpretation. In other words, it defines the factors of intention in markedly different ways in the different contexts, yet does not assert that one set of terms is more authoritative than the other or even take note of the differences between them. In fact, it takes one of the terms common to the non-offense clauses and the Vinīta-vatthu and defines it in one way in one context and another in the other. All of this creates a great deal of confusion.</td>

<tr><td>The non-offense clauses state that there is no offense for a bhikkhu who acts unintentionally, not knowing, or without aiming at death. In the Vinīta-vatthu, <em>unintentionally</em> is used to describe cases in which a bhikkhu acts accidentally, such as dropping a poorly held stone, brick, or adze; removing a pestle from a shelf and accidentally knocking off another one. <em>Not knowing</em> is used in cases in which the bhikkhu deliberately does an action but without knowing that his action could cause death. An example would be giving food to a friend not knowing that it is poisoned. <em>Not aiming at death</em> is used in cases where the bhikkhu deliberately does an action but does not intend that action to result in death. Relevant examples include trying to help a bhikkhu who is choking on food by slapping him on the back and inadvertently causing his death; telling a bhikkhu to stand on a piece of scaffolding while helping with construction work, only to see the scaffolding collapse; describing the joys of heaven to an audience, only to have a member of the audience decide to commit suicide in hopes of going there.</td>
<td>不犯條款說，比丘無意、不知、或不以死亡為目的的行為並不構成犯戒。在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中，「<em>無意</em>」用來描述比丘意外地做出的行為的情況，例如，把拿不穩的石頭、磚頭或錛子掉在地上；從架子上取下一把研杵，不小心碰掉了另一把。「<em>不知</em>」用於比丘故意做某事但不知道他的行為可能導致死亡的情況。一個例子是給朋友食物，但他不知道食物有毒。「<em>不以死亡為目的</em>」用於比丘故意做某事但無意導致死亡的情況。相關的例子包括，試圖拍打一位被食物噎住的比丘的背來幫助他，卻無意中導致了他的死亡；告訴一位比丘在幫忙建築時站在鷹架上，結果卻看到鷹架倒塌；向聽眾描述天界的歡樂，結果卻有一位聽眾決定自殺，希望能去那裡。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, to fulfill the factor of intention here, a bhikkhu must be acting intentionally, knowingly, and aiming at death.</td>
<td>因此，為了滿足這裡的意圖因素，比丘必須有意地、明知地、以死亡為目的而行動。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The word-analysis covers all the same points—although it shuffles the terms around—when it defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” Without teasing out the differences in terminology, we may simply note the important point added in its analysis, which is that an act of manslaughter counts as intentional here only when the bhikkhu has made a clear decision to kill. Thus if he were to strike a person unthinkingly in a sudden fit of rage, without being clear about what his intention was, it would not qualify as “intentional” here. The Commentary seconds this point when it defines <em>having made the decision</em> as “having summoned up a reckless mind state, ‘crushing’ through the power of an attack.” The Sub-commentary does not explain <em>crushing</em> or <em>attack</em> here, but apparently they mean aggressively overcoming, through a brute act of will, any contrary or hesitant thoughts in the mind.</td>
<td>當語句解說將<em>故意</em>定義為「有意願，明知且有意識地做出決定」時，語句解說涵蓋了所有相同的要點，儘管它對術語進行了重新排列。在不梳理出術語差異的情況下，我們可以簡單地注意到其分析中添加的重點，即只有當比丘明確決定殺人時，過失殺人行為才算故意殺人。因此，如果他在沒有明確意圖的情況下，突然發怒，不假思索地打人，這裡就不算是「故意」。《義註》支持這一點，將<em>做出決定</em>定義為「喚起魯莽的精神狀態，透過攻擊的力量『粉碎』」。這裡的《複註》並沒有解釋<em>粉碎</em>或<em>攻擊</em>，但顯然它們的意思是透過意志的殘酷行為，積極地克服心中任何相反或猶豫的想法。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains a few cases where bhikkhus kill people in situations where they did not even know that there was a person there: throwing a stone over a precipice, not knowing that there was a person standing below; sitting down on a pile of cloth on a chair, not knowing that a child was underneath the cloth; and setting fire to a grove, not knowing that there were people in the grove. The Buddha dismisses the first two cases without explanation as not coming under this rule. The last he classifies as an example of <em>not aiming at death</em>. We can conclude from this example that <em>aiming at death</em> must include the perception that there was someone there who could die. The Commentary seconds this conclusion in its analysis of the phrase <em>knowingly and consciously</em> in the word-analysis’s definition of intentionally. Although it again shuffles the terms around—using <em>consciously</em> to describe what the Vinīta-vatthu describes as <em>knowingly</em>—the important point in its conclusion is that an essential element in the factor of intention is the factor of perception: In its words, one must be aware that, “This is a living being.”</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中記載了一些比丘在他們甚至不知道有人在那裡的情況下殺人的例子：<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0111a12">在懸崖上扔石頭</a>，卻不知道下面站著一個人；<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0107a11">坐在椅子上的一堆布上</a>，不知道布下有個孩子；<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0116a04">放火燒了一座小樹林</a>，卻不知道樹林裡還有人。佛陀對前兩種情況不予理會，沒有做出任何解釋，因為不屬於這條戒條。他將最後一個歸類為<em>不以死亡為目的</em>的例子。從這個例子我們可以得出結論，<em>以死亡為目的</em>必須包括感知：那裡有人可能會死。《義註》在語句解說的「故意」定義中的<em>明知且有意識地</em>一詞的分析中，支持了這一結論。儘管它再次重新排列了術語－用<em>有意識</em>來描述《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》所描述的<em>明知</em>－其結論中的重點是，意圖因素中的一個基本要素是感知因素：用它的話說，必須是意識到：「這是一個活著的眾生。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Note that, given this definition, one need not know that the living being is a human being for the factor of perception to be fulfilled. The Commentary illustrates this point with an example in which a bhikkhu who, seeing a goat lying down in a certain spot during the day, decides to return to that spot to kill the goat that night. In the meantime, however, the goat gets up and a man comes to lie down in its place. The bhikkhu approaches the man in the dark, still thinking him to be a goat, and kills him. The verdict: a pārājika.</td>
<td>請注意，根據此定義，無需知道活著的眾生是人類即可滿足感知因素。《義註》中用一個例子來說明這一點：一位比丘白天看到一隻山羊躺在某個地方，決定當天晚上回到那個地方殺死這隻山羊。然而同時，山羊站了起來，一個人在它的位置上躺了下來。比丘在黑暗中接近這個人，仍然認為他是一隻山羊，並殺死了他。結論：《波羅夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although this judgment may seem strange, there is nothing in the Canon to contradict it. The closest case in the Vinīta-vatthu concerns a bhikkhu who digs a pitfall with the intention that whatever living beings fall into it will perish. The penalty, if an animal dies as a result, is a pācittiya; if a human being, a pārājika. In this case, the intention/perception of killing a living being is broad enough to include a human being, and so fulfills the relevant factors here.</td>
<td>雖然這個判斷看起來很奇怪，但《聖典》中沒有任何內容與之相矛盾。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中最接近的例子涉及一位比丘，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0103a10">他挖了一個陷阱</a>，意圖讓任何掉入其中的生物都會死亡。若動物因此死亡，則懲罰為《波逸提》；如果是人類，則為《波羅夷》。在這種情況下，殺死生物的意圖/感知足夠廣泛，廣泛到足以包括人類，因此滿足這裡的相關因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing this last case, the Commentary notes that if one digs the pitfall but then renounces one’s intention to cause death, one has to completely fill in the pitfall in such a way that it cannot cause injury—even to the extent of causing someone to stumble—if one wants to avoid the penalty coming from any injury the pitfall might cause. If the pitfall is only partially filled in and a person stumbles into it and later dies from his injuries, the bhikkhu incurs the full offense under this rule. The same judgment applies to any other attempt to kill not aimed at a particular victim. For instance, if a bhikkhu harboring this sort of general intention builds a trap but then changes his mind, he has to destroy the trap so thoroughly that it cannot be reassembled. Similarly, when a bhikkhu writes a passage describing the advantages of dying (see below) with the thought that anyone who reads it might decide to commit suicide, if he then changes his mind he has to destroy the writing so thoroughly that it cannot be pieced together. If, instead of writing the passage himself, he simply picks up a pre-existing written passage of this sort and then—with a similar intention—puts it in a place where it might be easily seen, he can avoid any penalty simply by returning the passage to the place where he found it.</td>
<td>在討論最後一個案例時，《義註》指出，如果一個人挖了陷阱，但隨後又放棄了致人死亡的意圖，如果想避免因陷阱可能造成的傷害而受到懲罰，必須以一種不會造成傷害的方式完全填滿陷阱－甚至不會造成某人絆倒。如果陷阱只被部分填滿，而某人跌入其中並隨後因受傷而死亡，則根據此戒條，比丘將完全違犯。同樣的判決也適用於任何其他不針對特定受害者的殺害企圖。例如，如果一位比丘懷有這種普遍意圖，建造了一個陷阱，但後來又改變了主意，他必須徹底摧毀這個陷阱，使其無法重新組裝起來。同樣地，當一位比丘寫了一篇描述死亡好處的文章（見下文），並認為任何讀過它的人都可能決定自殺時，如果他隨後改變主意，他就必須徹底毀掉這篇文章，以至於無法將其拼湊起來。如果他不是自己寫這篇文章，而是僅僅拿起已有的此類書面文章，然後以類似的意圖將其放在容易看到的地方，他只需將文章放回到他發現它的地方就可以避免任何懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the topic of pitfalls, the Commentary also treats the issue of how much of an intention counts when setting up a situation that might cause death. Specifically, it asks whether—while one is digging a hole for another purpose—a passing thought that “this hole could kill anyone who fell into it” would fulfill the factor of intention under this rule, or whether this factor would be fulfilled only if the original purpose for digging the hole was to cause death. The Commentary notes that opinions are divided on this point, but it sides with the latter position.</td>
<td>在討論陷阱這個主題時，《義註》還討論了在造成可能導致死亡的情況時意圖的重要性的問題。具體來說，它詢問－當一個人為了另一個目的而挖洞時－一閃而過的想法「這個洞可能會殺死掉進去的任何人」會滿足本戒條下的意圖因素，或者這個因素只有在挖這個洞的最初目的是為了致人死亡的情況下才會被滿足。《義註》說，在這一點上意見分歧，但它支持後一種立場。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains an unusual case of a bhikkhu who uses a friend as a guinea pig for testing poison. The friend dies, and the bhikkhu incurs only a thullaccaya. The Commentary explains this by distinguishing two types of test: one to see if a particular poison is strong enough to kill a person; the other, to see if a particular person is strong enough to survive the poison. In either of these cases, the bhikkhu incurs a thullaccaya regardless of whether the victim dies. If, though, the bhikkhu gives poison to a person with the desire that it cause that person’s death, he incurs a pārājika if the victim dies, and a thullaccaya if not.</td>

<tr><td><strong>TELLING B TO KILL C.</strong> The way in which a bhikkhu is penalized for getting another person to commit a murder—through sign or verbal command—can be inferred from the discussion of accomplices under the preceding rule. The Vibhaṅga here, as under that rule, states that if one’s accomplice does not follow one’s instructions precisely, one is absolved of an offense. In discussing this point, the Commentary goes into great detail concerning the six ways the command to kill can be specified: the object [the person to be killed], the time, the place, the weapon to use, the action by which the weapon is to be used [e.g., “Stab him in the neck”], and the position the victim should be in [sitting, standing, lying down] when the act is to be done. If the instigator specifies any of these things and yet his accomplice does not carry them out to the letter, the instigator does not incur the penalty for the actual murder. For instance, Bhikkhu A tells his student B to kill C while C is sitting in meditation at midnight. The student gets into C’s room at midnight, only to find C asleep in bed, which is where he kills him. Bhikkhu A thus incurs only the thullaccaya for convincing his student to accept the command.</td>
<td><strong>叫 B 去殺 C。</strong>比丘因唆使他人去謀殺而受到懲罰的方式－透過示意動作或口頭命令－可以從前一個戒條下共犯的討論中推斷出來。根據該戒條，《經分別》在此說，如果共犯沒有完全遵循指示，那麼就可以免於犯戒。《義註》在論述這一點時，詳細闡述了殺人命令的六種措辭方式：對象[要被殺的人]、時間、地點、使用的武器、使用武器的動作[例如，「刺他的脖子」]，以及受害者在進行該行動時應採取的姿勢[坐著、站立、躺著]。如果教唆者指定了其中任何一項，但他的共犯沒有嚴格執行，則教唆者不會因實際謀殺而受到懲罰。例如，比丘 A 告訴他的學生 B ，在半夜 C 打坐的時候，殺了 C 。學生半夜進入 C 的房間，發現 C 睡在床上，於是他在那裡殺死了他。因此，比丘 A 只因說服他的學生接受命令而犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As under the preceding rule, the Commentary tries to argue that if B will certainly succeed in killing C in line with A’s command, A incurs a pārājika when giving the command, but again, this opinion does not conform with the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>正如前一個戒條一樣，《義註》試圖爭辯說，如果 B 按照 A 的命令肯定會成功殺死 C ，則 A 在發出命令時犯《波羅夷》，但同樣地，這種觀點不符合《經分別》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The case of the innocent accomplice—one who does not know that the action he is being told to do will result in death—also seems relevant here, as in the case where a bhikkhu prepares a syringe of poison and tells his accomplice, who thinks the syringe contains medicine, to inject it into a patient. There seems every reason to impose a pārājika on the bhikkhu if the patient then dies, but the accomplice would incur no offense.</td>
<td>無辜共犯的案例－一個不知道他被告知要做的行為會導致死亡的人－似乎也與這裡有關，就像一位比丘準備一筒注射器毒藥並告訴他的共犯的情況一樣，他的共犯認為注射器含有藥物，用於將其注射到病人體內。如果病人死了，似乎有充分的理由對比丘施加《波羅夷》，但共犯沒有犯戒。</td>

<tr><td><strong>RECOMMENDING MEANS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.</strong> Again from the Vinīta-vatthu: A bhikkhu tells an executioner to kill his victims mercifully with a single blow, rather than torturing them. The executioner follows his advice and the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika, for the recommendation to kill mercifully is still a recommendation to kill. According to the Vinīta-vatthu, if the executioner says that he will not follow the bhikkhu’s advice and then kills his victims as he pleases, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. The Commentary adds that if the executioner tries to follow the bhikkhu’s advice and yet needs more than one blow to do the job, the bhikkhu incurs a thullaccaya.</td>
<td><strong>建議死刑手段。</strong>再次來自《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》：一位比丘<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0116a05">告訴劊子手，要仁慈地一擊殺死受害者</a>，而不是折磨他們。劊子手聽從了他的建議，比丘犯《波羅夷》，因為仁慈地殺人的建議仍然是殺人的建議。根據《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，如果劊子手說他不會聽從比丘的建議，然後隨心所欲地殺死受害者，那麼比丘不會受到懲罰。《義註》補充說，如果劊子手試圖聽從比丘的建議，但需要不止一擊才能完成這項工作，比丘犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>INDIRECT STATEMENTS.</strong> The Canon and Commentary differ as to whether indirect statements that are not imperatives would also qualify as commands or recommendations under this rule. The Commentary maintains that a bhikkhu cannot get around a penalty by phrasing his wish for a murder in more roundabout ways, and gives an example in which a bhikkhu tells people, “In such-and-such a place a bandit is staying. Whoever cuts off his head will receive great honor from the King.” If any of the bhikkhu’s listeners kills the bandit as a result of his instigation, the Commentary says, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika.</td>
<td><strong>間接陳述。</strong>對於非命令性的間接陳述是否也符合本戒條下的命令或建議的問題，《聖典》和《義註》存在分歧。《義註》認為，比丘不能以更迂迴的方式表達他想要謀殺的願望來逃避懲罰，並舉了一個比丘告訴人們的例子：「在某某地方，有一個強盜居住。誰砍下他的頭，誰就會受到國王的極大榮耀。」《義註》說，如果比丘的任何聽眾在他的慫恿下殺死了強盜，比丘犯《波羅夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Examples of commands and recommendations in the Canon, however, are all expressed as imperatives: “Do this!” “If you want him to die, do this.” The only examples of indirect statements are those in which a bhikkhu expresses a wish, “O, if only so-and-so were murdered.” According to the Vibhaṅga, this statement incurs a dukkaṭa regardless of whether it is made in public or private, and regardless of whether one knows that anyone else is overhearing it or not. There is no discussion, however, of what one’s intention might be in making the statement, nor of the consequences for the speaker if anyone, inspired by his remark, actually kills the person in question. This implies that the authors of the Vibhaṅga did not regard statements of this sort as fulfilling the factor of effort under this rule. This may seem unduly lenient, but given that a bhikkhu whose express command to kill is followed but not to the letter would also incur only a thullaccaya, this judgment seems consistent with the Vibhaṅga’s pattern of assigning penalties.</td>
<td>然而，《聖典》中的命令和建議的例子都以祈使語氣表達：「這樣做！」「如果你想讓他死，就這麼做吧。」間接陳述的唯一例子是那些比丘表達願望的例子：「噢，如果某某被謀殺就好了。」根據《經分別》，這種陳述會犯《突吉羅》，無論它是公開說還是私下說，也無論一個人是否知道其他人正在無意中聽到它。然而，沒有討論發表陳述的意圖是什麼，也沒有討論如果有人受到他的言論的啟發，實際上殺死了有關的人，那麼他將面臨什麼後果。這暗示《經分別》的作者並不認為此類陳述滿足了本戒條下的努力因素。這可能顯得過於寬鬆，但考慮到比丘如果遵守明示的殺戮命令，但不嚴格執行，也只會犯《偷蘭遮》，這一判決似乎與《經分別》的懲罰模式一致。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition to the four above categories of means of killing, the Commentary includes two of its own:</td>
<td>除了上述四類殺人手段外，《義註》還包括自己的兩類：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Magical formulae:</em> reciting passages that call on malevolent spirits to bring about a person’s death, using voodoo, etc.</td>
<td>—<em>魔咒：</em>背誦召喚惡靈導致人死亡的經文、使用巫術等。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Psychic powers:</em> using the “evil eye” or other similar innate powers.</td>
<td>—<em>神通：</em>使用「邪眼」或其他類似的先天力量。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Canon contains a number of passages—MN 56 is one example—describing people who, “developed in mind,” use their powers to kill. The Commentary notes the existence of these passages and of “some teachers” who cite them as proof that meditative powers can be used in this way, but it dismisses the idea on the grounds that meditative powers are skillful and based on pleasant mental states, whereas the act of killing is unskillful and based on painful mental states. The Sub-commentary adds that the powers described in the Canon are actually based on magical formulae. Still, because the success of these formulae depends on a certain level of concentration, it would seem that using one’s powers of concentration to kill would fulfill the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>《聖典》包含許多段落（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/056.html">《中部》56經</a>就是一個例子），描述那些「心智發達」的人，利用自己的力量殺人。《義註》指出了這些段落的存在以及「一些老師」的存在，這些老師引用它們作為冥想力量可以以這種方式使用的證據，但它駁回了這個想法，因為冥想力量是善巧的並且基於愉快的精神狀態，而殺戮行為是不善巧的並且基於痛苦的精神狀態。《複註》補充說，《聖典》中描述的力量實際上是基於魔咒的。不過，因為這些咒語的成功取決於某種程度的定，所以用定力殺人似乎就滿足了這裡的努力因素。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>As the rule indicates, a bhikkhu may commit an offense under this rule not only by using any of the six above-mentioned means of taking life but also by “searching for an assassin.” The Vibhaṅga explains this phrase in the rule simply with a list of weapons: a sword, a spear, a harpoon (§—BD omits this item), a skewer/stake, a club, a stone, a knife, poison, or a rope. There are two ways of making sense of this list. One is that, because the Pali word for assassin is literally “knife-carrier” (<em>satthahāraka</em>), the Vibhaṅga is taking pains to explain that an assassin might also use other weapons aside from a knife. The other way of interpreting the list, favored by the Commentary, is to view the Vibhaṅga’s list as an attempt to define the word <em>satthahāraka</em>—which, according to the Commentary, is a general term for a murderous weapon. The Commentary then goes on to say that the entire phrase <em>searching for an assassin</em> means setting up a stationary device, as described above. There are two problems with this interpretation, the first being that the word <em>satthahāraka</em> clearly means “assassin” in other parts of the Canon (see, for example, MN 145); the second being that this interpretation makes the phrase entirely superfluous: setting up a stationary device is already covered by another part of the rule. Thus we will follow the first interpretation of the Vibhaṅga’s explanation of the phrase: It is indicating that an assassin may use any weapon at all.</td>
<td>正如戒條所表明的，比丘不僅可以使用上述六種奪取生命方式中的任何一種，而且還可以透過「尋找行兇者」來犯戒。《經分別》僅僅用一張武器清單解釋了戒條中的這句話：劍、矛、魚叉（§—《戒律書》省略了此項）、串子/木樁、棍棒、石頭、刀、毒藥或繩索。有兩種方法可以理解這個清單。一是，因為巴利單字中行兇者的字面意思是「持刀者」（<em>satthahāraka</em>），所以《經分別》煞費苦心地解釋行兇者除了刀之外還可能使用其他武器。理解該清單的另一種方式，受到《義註》的青睞，是將《經分別》的清單視為試圖定義 <em>satthahāraka</em> 此單字－根據《義註》，此單字是殺人武器的通用術語。《義註》接著說，<em>尋找行兇者</em>整句話意思是設置固定裝置，如上所述。這個理解有兩個問題，第一個是 <em>satthahāraka</em> 此單字在《聖典》的其他部分中明確表示「行兇者」（參見，例如，<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/145.html">《中部》145經</a>）；第二個是，這種理解使該句話完全多餘：戒條的另一部分已經涵蓋了設置固定裝置。因此，我們將遵循《經分別》對這句話的解釋的第一個理解：它表明行兇者可以使用任何武器。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question remains, however, as to how this interpretation is not redundant with <em>commanding</em> under the explanation of the ways of taking life. The answer appears to be this: The word <em>satthahāraka</em> is most commonly used in the Canon in the context of an assisted suicide, in which a person who wants to die but cannot bring himself to commit suicide arranges for someone else, a satthahāraka, to kill him. Thus the inclusion of this phrase in the rule means that a bhikkhu intent on dying who arranges for someone else to do the job for him would incur all the derived offenses leading up to the actual death. At present, this would rule out trying to get a doctor to arrange an assisted suicide for oneself. If one were to help arrange an assisted suicide for someone else, the case would come under <em>commanding</em>, above, as would the case of arranging an assassin for someone else not at that person’s request.</td>
<td>然而，問題仍然在於，在解釋奪取生命的方式時，這種理解如何與<em>命令</em>並存而不顯得多餘。答案似乎是這樣的：「<em>satthahāraka</em>」這個單字在《聖典》中最常用於協助自殺，即一個想要死但又無法自殺的人安排其他人（satthahāraka）殺死他。因此，在戒條中包含這句話意味著，一個想要死亡的比丘如果安排其他人為他做這項工作，將會犯下導致實際死亡的所有衍生違犯。目前，這將排除試圖讓醫生為自己安排協助自殺的可能性。如果要幫助他人安排協助自殺，那麼該情況屬於上述的<em>命令</em>，就像在未經他人請求下，為該人安排行兇者的情況一樣。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see below, cases where one tries to kill oneself without arranging for someone else to do the job would not come under this rule. The apparent reason for making a distinction and including the act of “searching for an assassin” to kill oneself under this rule is that, in doing so, one would be asking another person to take on the seriously unskillful kamma of taking a human life.</td>
<td>正如我們將在下面看到的，一個人試圖自殺而不安排其他人來完成這項工作的情況不屬於這一戒條。做出區分並將「尋找行兇者」自殺行為納入這項戒條的明顯原因是，這樣做時，會要求另一個人承擔奪人生命的嚴重不善業。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s most useful comment in this context is its assertion that <em>searching</em> here must mean actually arranging, because the simple act of looking for an assassin without actually finding one would not incur any of the offenses under this rule.</td>
<td>在這種情況下，《義註》中最有用的評論是它斷言這裡的<em>尋找</em>必須意味著實際安排，因為僅僅只有尋找行兇者而沒有實際找到，不會招致本戒條下的任何罪行。</td>

<tr><td>This, the third type of act covered by this rule, can include berating a sick person (“Why do you keep hanging on to life like this? Don’t you realize what a burden you are to others?”) or simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death. The Vinīta-vatthu also includes under this type of act any statements that a nurse might make out of compassion to shorten the miseries of an illness by encouraging a patient to let go of life so as not to dawdle in the face of death. Thus, the Commentary notes, a bhikkhu talking to a dying patient should be very circumspect in how he chooses his words, focusing not on how to speed up the dying process but on how to inspire the patient with the following thoughts: “The attainment of the paths and fruitions is not out of the ordinary for a virtuous person. So, having formed no attachment for such things as your dwelling, and establishing mindfulness in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, or the body, you should be heedful in your attention.” The Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr4">Pr 4</a> contains a number of stories in which bhikkhus comfort a dying bhikkhu by asking him to reflect on what he has attained through the practice, which was apparently a common way of encouraging a dying bhikkhu to focus his thoughts on the best object possible. The suttas also contain advice on how to encourage patients facing death. See, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN143.html">MN 143</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN36_7.html">SN 36:7</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN55_54.html">SN 55:54</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN6_16.html">AN 6:16</a>.

</tr>
<tr><td><em>Inaction.</em> Given the Vibhaṅga’s definition of taking life, we can infer that inaction does not fulfill the factor of effort here, for it does not cut off the life faculty. Thus if a bhikkhu sits idly when seeing a flood sweep a person downstream, he commits no offense—regardless of his feelings about the person’s death—even if the person then drowns. Recommending that another person sit idly as well would also not fulfill the factor of effort here, because the category of <em>command</em> covers only the act of inciting the listener to do any of the four actions that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule.</td>
<td><em>不作為（見死不救）。</em>根據《經分別》對奪取生命的定義，我們可以推斷，不作為在這裡並不能滿足努力因素，因為它不會切斷命根。因此，如果比丘看到洪水把人沖到下游時，無所事事地坐著，那麼無論他對這個人的死亡有什麼感受，即使這個人隨後被淹死，他也不會犯任何戒。建議另一個人也無所事事地坐著也不會滿足這裡的努力因素，因為<em>命令</em>類別僅涵蓋煽動聽者執行本戒條下滿足努力因素的四種行動中的任何一種。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Medical care and life-support.</em> The same holds true if a bhikkhu decides not to give a patient a treatment—or to discontinue treatment—that might conceivably extend the patient’s life: It does not fulfill the factor of effort, for such acts do not cut off the life faculty. At most they simply allow it to end on its own. The Canon supports this inference by treating such actions not under this rule but under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VIII.26.1-8">Mv.VIII.26.3-4</a>, where it imposes only a dukkaṭa on the act of refusing to give any treatment at all to an ill bhikkhu, or of discontinuing all care for an ill bhikkhu prior to his recovery or death. This shows that the compilers of the Canon did not regard these acts as cutting off the life faculty. (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VIII.26.1-8">Mv.VIII.26.8</a> lists the ideal characteristics of a bhikkhu who tends to the sick, but does not impose a penalty on a bhikkhu who cares for the sick but lacks the ideal qualities; at no point does the Canon impose a required level of care for the sick. The compilers’ refusal to mandate a level of care is wise. If there were a case in which the bhikkhus did not feel that that level of care was appropriate for their patient, they would have only one option: to abandon the patient, so as to incur only a dukkaṭa and not the potentially higher penalty for not measuring up to the mandated care. Thus, instead of protecting the patient, a higher level of mandated care would expose the patient to abandonment.) For this reason, deciding to withhold or discontinue a particular treatment—while still continuing otherwise to care for the patient—would not be grounds for an offense.</td>
<td><em>醫療護理和生命維持。</em>如果比丘決定不提供患者可以延長患者生命的治療，或停止治療，同樣的情況也適用：它不滿足努力因素，因為這樣的行為不會切斷命根。最多只是允許生命自行結束。《聖典》支持這一推論，不是根據本戒條而是根據<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0391a09">《大品》.八.26.3-4</a>來處理此類行為，其中拒絕對生病的比丘進行任何治療，或在生病的比丘康復或死亡之前停止對他的所有護理的行為，僅只犯《突吉羅》。由此可見，《聖典》的編纂者並不認為這些行為是切斷命根的行為。（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0393a02">《大品》.八.26.8</a>列出了照顧病人的比丘的理想特質，但沒有對照顧病人但缺乏理想特質的比丘施加懲罰；《聖典》在任何時候都沒有規定病人所需的護理水平。編譯者拒絕強制規定護理水平是明智的。如果出現比丘們認為該水平的護理不適合他們的病人的情況，他們只有一個選擇：放棄患者，這樣只會犯《突吉羅》，而不是因為未達到強制規定的護理水平而受到潛在的更高懲罰。因此，更高水平的強制護理不但不能保護患者，反而會使患者面臨被遺棄的風險。）因此，決定拒絕或停止特定治療－同時仍繼續以其他方式護理患者－不會成為犯戒的理由。</td>

<tr><td>If, however, a bhikkhu caring for a patient acts in a way to cut off the patient’s life faculty, that would fulfill the factor of effort here. The Vinīta-vatthu makes this point with a set of cases in which bhikkhus give patients treatments that are actually harmful for the patients. In the instances where the other factors for an offense are present—the bhikkhus mean to kill the patient, and the patient dies—the bhikkhus incur the full offense. In another set of cases, a bhikkhu feeling pity for a friend in severe pain praises the pleasures that await him after death. Again, in the instances where the bhikkhu intends to bring about the patient’s death and the patient dies, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika.</td>

<tr><td><em>Shared responsibility.</em> Unlike the Vibhaṅga to the preceding rule, the Vibhaṅga here does not explicitly discuss the issue of how to allot penalties when a group of bhikkhus acts together to commit a murder but only one of them delivers the fatal blow. However, the Vinīta-vatthu contains a series of cases in which bhikkhus act as a group to give a treatment to a sick bhikkhu with the aim of ending his life. When the bhikkhu dies, all of them incur a pārājika. In one of the cases the bhikkhu dies from a medical treatment to the nose, in another he dies from eating food. None of the texts discuss whether all the bhikkhus in question took turns giving the fatal dosage, or if only one of the bhikkhus did while the others helped to prepare it. Given that arranging an assassin would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule, it seems reasonable to infer that actively assisting in a murder would also fulfill the factor, even if one does not deliver the fatal blow. From this inference we can conclude that the discussion of shared responsibility under the preceding rule would also apply here.</td>
<td><em>共同責任。</em>與前一個戒條的《經分別》不同的是，這裡的《經分別》並沒有明確討論當一群比丘共同實施謀殺但只有一個人造成致命一擊時如何分配懲罰的問題。然而，《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》包含一系列比丘們以團體的方式治療生病的比丘，並打算結束他的生命的案例。當比丘去世時，他們都犯《波羅夷》。在其中一例中，比丘因鼻子接受治療而死亡，在另一例中，他則因進食而死亡。沒有任何文本討論是否所有相關的比丘輪流給予致命的劑量，或者是只有一名比丘這樣做，而其他比丘則幫助準備。鑑於安排一名行兇者就滿足了本戒條下的努力因素，似乎可以合理地推斷，即使沒有造成致命一擊，積極協助謀殺也滿足了這一因素。由此推論，我們可以得出結論，前一個戒條中關於共同責任的討論也適用於此處。</td>

<tr><td>2) Some group-of-six bhikkhus, for the fun of it, throw a rock from a mountaintop and accidentally kill a young cowherd standing below—again, no penalty for the death, but a dukkaṭa for throwing a rock in fun. (The Commentary states that <em>rock</em> here also covers sticks, bricks, and other similar objects; and that <em>throwing</em> also includes rolling. It also states that if a bhikkhu has a valid reason for throwing or rolling a rock not in fun—for example, he is engaged in construction work and rolls a piece of rock to someone else on the job; he is eating his meal and throws a piece of wood to chase away crows or dogs—he incurs no offense.)</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>3) A bhikkhu, feeling oppressed and discontented, throws himself over a cliff. Instead of dying, he lands on and kills a hapless basket-maker standing at the foot of the cliff—again, no offense for the death, but a dukkaṭa for throwing oneself from a high place. This rule shows that attempts to kill oneself—aside from searching for an assassin, as mentioned above—would not come under the main rule here, because the bhikkhu would have apparently felt pain when landing on the basket-maker, and yet the penalty is only a dukkaṭa. If the case had been treated under the main rule, he would have been penalized with a thullaccaya instead.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary extrapolates from this case to apply the dukkaṭa to all attempts at suicide, including even the decision not to take food when motivated by a desire to die. However, it then runs into the question of how far this penalty applies to a bhikkhu who is ill. Its verdict: As long as medicine and attendants are available to him, the penalty would still apply. But then it lists two cases where the penalty would <em>not</em> apply: (a) A bhikkhu is suffering from a long and serious illness, and the attendant bhikkhus are fed up with caring for him, thinking, “<em>When</em> will we be free of this sick one?” If the bhikkhu reflects that, even with medical care, his body won’t last and that the bhikkhus are being put to difficulties, he incurs no penalty in refusing food and medicine. (b) A bhikkhu—reflecting that his illness is harsh, the forces of life are running out, and yet the noble attainments appear to be within his reach—may refuse food and medicine without penalty.</td>
<td>《義註》從這個案例中推斷，將《突吉羅》應用於所有自殺企圖，甚至包括出於求死的動機而決定不吃東西。然而，接下來的問題是，這種懲罰對於生病的比丘適用到什麼程度。其判決是：只要他有藥物和護理人員，懲罰仍然適用。但隨後它列出了兩種<em>不</em>適用懲罰的情況： (a) 一位比丘患有長期而嚴重的疾病，護理的比丘厭倦了照顧他，心想：「我們<em>什麼時候</em>才能擺脫這個病人？」如果比丘反思，即使有醫療護理，他的身體也無法長久，而比丘們正面臨困難，那麼他不會因拒絕食物和藥物而受到懲罰。 (b) 比丘－反思他的病情很嚴重，生命力正在耗盡，且聖果看起來是在他力所能及的範圍內－可以拒絕食物和藥物，而不受懲罰。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s deliberations here show how difficult it is to legislate in this area, and there are reasons to question the way it applies the Great Standards here. Case (b) is apparently derived from SN 4:23, where Ven. Godhika takes his life and gains arahantship just moments before death; and from SN 35:87, where the Buddha says that one who puts down this body without taking up another body dies blamelessly. However, in arriving at its verdict in this case, the Commentary has to add the factors of motivation and perception to the equation, factors that are absent from the rule on which the judgment is based. It also leaves unanswered the question of how harsh the disease has to be, and how near the anticipated attainments, to qualify for this exemption.</td>
<td>《義註》中的審議顯示了在這一領域制定律法是多麼困難，並且有理由質疑其在此應用《四大教示》的方式。情況 (b) 顯然源自<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/04.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E7%9E%BF%E6%8F%90%E8%BF%A6">《相應部》4:23經</a>，其中瞿提迦尊者在臨終前自殺並證得阿羅漢果。從<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%83%E8%BB%8A%E5%8C%BF">《相應部》35:87經</a>，佛陀說，放下此身而不取他身的人，死時無可指責。然而，在對本情況做出判決時，《義註》必須將動機和感知添加到因素中，而這些因素是判決所依據的戒條中所沒有的。它也沒有回答這樣的問題：疾病必須有多嚴重，以及預期的成就有多接近，才有資格獲得這種豁免。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This same holds true for case (a), which entails even more dubious reasoning. The Commentary’s judgment here has no clear precedent in the Canon; there is no clear line for deciding exactly how bad the illness and how fed up the attendants have to be for this case to apply; and why should the feelings of other people determine when it is or is not allowable to refuse food?</td>
<td>對於情況（a）也是如此，它的推理更加暧昧可疑。《義註》此處的判斷在《聖典》中沒有明確的先例；對於這種情況的適用，沒有明確的界線來確定病情的嚴重程度以及護理人員必須有多厭倦；而且為什麼要根據別人的感受來決定何時允許或不允許拒絕食物？</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It is worth noting that the origin story to the original rule here gave the Buddha the opportunity, had he wanted it, to formulate a general rule against attempted suicides, but he chose not to. He later formulated this subsidiary rule only when a bhikkhu attempted a suicide in a way that endangered the life and safety of another person. Thus a more appropriate way of applying the Great Standards to this subsidiary rule would be to extend it only to cases of that sort: where a bhikkhu’s attempts at suicide would bring danger to another person’s life and limb.</td>
<td>值得注意的是，這裡原始戒條的起源故事給了佛陀機會，如果他願意的話，可以制定禁止試圖自殺的一般戒條，但他選擇不這樣做。後來，只有當比丘試圖以會危害他人生命和安全的方式自殺時，他才制定了這條輔助戒條。因此，將《四大教示》應用於這條輔助戒條的一個更合適的方法是僅將其擴展到此類情況：比丘的試圖自殺會給另一個人的生命和肢體帶來危險。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for ways of attempting suicide that do not endanger others, it seems better to follow the Buddha’s wisdom in not legislating about this issue at all, and to treat it as a matter of Dhamma rather than Vinaya. In other words, one should keep in mind his comment in SN 35:87 that the only blameless death is an arahant’s. If, lacking that attainment, one chooses to refuse food when ill to speed up one’s death, one should be heedful of the risks that death and rebirth can involve.</td>
<td>至於試圖自殺而不危及他人的方式，似乎最好遵循佛陀的智慧，根本不對此議題制定律法，並將其視為「法」而不是「律」的問題。換句話說，人們應該記住他在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%83%E8%BB%8A%E5%8C%BF">《相應部》35:87經</a>中的評論，即唯一無可指責的死亡是阿羅漢的死亡。如果缺乏這種成就，在生病時選擇拒絕食物以加速死亡，則應該警惕死亡和重生可能涉及的風險。</td>

But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views—with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.’ Thus—by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human—he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.”</td>

This is the cessation of stress…. This is the way leading to the cessation of stress…. These are (mental) effluents…. This is the origination of effluents…. This is the cessation of effluents….

<tr><td>The term <em>nibbāna</em> literally means extinguishing, as of a fire. The commentarial explanation of this term that best fits the way it is used in the Canon is found at Vism.VIII,247, where Buddhaghosa derives it etymologically from <em>nir</em>, a negative prefix, and <em>vāna</em>, binding: thus, unbinding or liberation. In the physics of the Buddha’s time, fire as it burned was said to be in a state of agitation, dependence, attachment, and entrapment—both clinging to and being trapped by its sustenance. Extinguished, it was said to become calm, independent, and unattached. It let go of its sustenance and was released. In the mind’s extinguishing, or unbinding, a parallel change occurs.</td>
<td>涅槃 <em>nibbāna</em> 一詞的字面意思是熄滅，如火一樣。這個術語最適合它在《聖典》中的使用方式的註釋解釋，可以在 《清淨道論》.八,247 中找到，其中<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>在詞源學上從 <em>nir</em> （否定前綴）和 <em>vāna</em> （束縛）衍生出這個術語：因此，意思是解除束縛或解脫。在佛陀時代的物理學中，火在燃燒時被認為處於一種激動、依賴、執著和束縛的狀態——既執著於它的維持物，又被它的維持物所束縛。據說，熄滅後，它會變得平靜、獨立、不執著。它放下了它的維持物並被釋放了。當心熄滅，或解脫時，會發生相似的變化。</td>

Regardless of which class they fall into, however, they are all superior human states. As for the Wings to Awakening, the Commentary maintains that they count as superior human states only when developed to the level of any of the transcendent paths. It also adds that any other attainment equivalent to a lokuttara dhamma—such as complete comprehension of the four noble truths—would fulfill the factor of object here as well.</td>

Such a statement fulfills this factor only if it explicitly mentions oneself, although the reference to the state may be either explicit or implicit. Explicit mention of the state would include saying such things as, “I have attained the first jhāna,” “I have seen the heavenly realms,” “I know my previous lifetimes.” The Vibhaṅga’s example of an implicit mention of a state is the statement, “I delight in an empty dwelling,” the implication being that one’s delight comes from the attainment of jhāna. At present, many meditation communities have developed their own idioms for describing superior human attainments—one being “I have no doubts about the Buddha’s teaching” as a way of claiming stream-entry—and, in the context of such communities, idioms of this sort would count as implicit mention as well. As we will see under the discussion of intention, this sort of statement would incur an offense only if one intended the implicit meaning.</td>

In the first case, the offender is rebuked by another bhikkhu who could read minds; in the second, the offender is rebuked by a devatā. In both cases, the Buddha imposes a dukkaṭa on the offenders. Thus the Commentary and K/Commentary conclude that a statement mentioning oneself in connection with a superior human state must be directed at a human listener for it to fulfill the factor of effort here. If one makes such a statement in private or directs it to a common animal or a deva, one incurs only a dukkaṭa.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary raises a question not addressed in the Vibhaṅga: Does <em>mentioning a state in connection with oneself</em> include claims about attainments in one’s previous lives? Without explaining its reasoning, it simply says No: <em>In connection with oneself</em> applies only to the present aggregates and not to past ones. With regard to the mahaggata dhammas, it would be possible to make a claim about an attainment in a past life that would not apply to one’s present state, because the simple fact that one may have attained jhāna in a previous lifetime has no implications bearing on the present lifetime. That sort of attainment doesn’t necessarily carry over from one lifetime to the next. With regard to lokuttara dhammas, however, the fact that one may have achieved stream-entry in a previous lifetime <em>would</em> have implications for the present lifetime: One is destined to achieve at least stream-entry again at some point before death, which puts one on the level of a faith-follower or a Dhamma-follower, “one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill” (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN25_1.html">SN 25:1</a>). This is equivalent to the path to stream-entry. So it would seem reasonable to say that a claim to a mahaggata dhamma attained in a previous lifetime would not fulfill the factor of effort here, whereas a claim to a lokuttara dhamma attained in a previous lifetime would. And, of course, if a bhikkhu falsely claims present knowledge of previous lifetimes, that would unequivocally fulfill this factor.</td>
<td>《義註》提出了《經分別》中未提及的問題：<em>提及與自己有關的境界</em>是否包括宣稱自己前世的成就？它沒有解釋其推理，只是簡單地說「不」：<em>與自己相關</em>僅適用於現在的五蘊，而不適用於過去的五蘊。就廣大法而言，可以宣稱前世的成就不適用於現在的狀態，因為一個人可能在前世證得禪那的這一簡單事實並不代表會持續到今生。這種成就不一定會從一世延續到下一世。然而，就出世法而言，一個人在前世可能已證得入流這一事實，<em>會</em>對今生產生持續影響：一個人注定至少會在死前的某個時刻再次證得入流，這使得他在信仰追隨者或佛法追隨者的層面上，「進入正確的道路，進入善人之地，超越凡夫之地」（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/25.html#%E4%B8%80%E7%9C%BC">《相應部》25:1經</a>）。這相當於入流道。因此，如果說前世證得的廣大法不能滿足這裡努力的因素，而說前世證得的出世間法則可以，這似乎是合理的。當然，如果比丘虛假地聲稱擁有前世的現時知識，那就明確地滿足了本因素。</td>

The Commentary focuses on the first of these characteristics as essential: One must know before making the statement that it will be a lie.

<tr><td>Other examples of not intending to misrepresent the truth appear in a series of cases in the Vinīta-vatthu where bhikkhus are absolved of an offense under this rule because they “did not intend to boast.” The Vibhaṅga gives no precise definition of this phrase, but the cases in question give a fair idea of what it means. They all involve statements where the reference to a superior human state is only implicit. In some of them, ill bhikkhus are asked—as was common in the time of the Buddha—“Do you have any superior human states (§)?” the purpose being—if they had such an attainment—to focus their minds on it; and if not, to direct their efforts to gaining such an attainment before their illness worsened. The ill bhikkhus respond in a variety of ways which, on the surface, look like equivocation. They don’t have any superior human attainments, yet don’t want to give the impression that they’ve achieved nothing at all, so they say such things as, “A state to be aroused through the arousing of energy,” or, “A state to be aroused through committed commitment.” In other cases, the ill bhikkhus are told not to fear death and they respond, “I’m not afraid of death,” or, “He who has remorse might be afraid of death.” In still other cases, ill bhikkhus are asked how they are bearing up under their illnesses and they respond, “This could not be borne by any old person (§),” or, “This could not be borne by an ordinary person (§).” There are also cases where bhikkhus are being pressured by their relatives to disrobe and they respond with such statements as, “It’s impossible for a person like me to live in a house,” or, “I have blocked off sensual passions.”</td>

The Sub-commentary, however, notes that the Commentary’s definition does not fit the Vinīta-vatthu cases and so gives its own definition of “not intending to boast”: saying something that would fulfill the factor of effort yet without desiring to speak of a superior human state, and without being aware that one’s words imply such a state. Drawing on the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, we can qualify the Sub-commentary’s explanation by noting that this exemption applies even if the reference to oneself is explicit, but not if the reference to the superior human state is.</td>
<td>奇怪的是，考慮到對這些情況的解釋，當《義註》討論不犯條款中「無意誇耀」的因素時，它將其定義為適用於不為欲望所驅使、向他的比丘同儕做出非欺騙性的知識宣稱的比丘。然而，《複註》指出，《義註》的定義與《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》的案例不符，因此給出了自己的「無意誇耀」的定義：說一些可以滿足努力因素的事情，但不想談論上人法，且沒有意識到自己的言語暗示著這樣的境界。借鑒《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的例子，我們可以指出即使明確提及自己，該豁免也適用，來限定《複註》的解釋，但明確提及上人法則不適用。</td>

<tr><td>Thus, if one makes an innocent statement that could be construed as implying a claim to a superior human state without explicitly mentioning such as state, then regardless of how other people might interpret it, if one’s purpose is not to boast or lay claim to that state then there is no offense. However, if the inference was intended—and a deliberate misrepresentation—the factor of intention here would be fulfilled. As for untrue statements that make explicit reference to a superior human state—e.g., “I have reached the fourth jhāna”—the inference is obviously intended, and so these automatically fulfill the factor of “intending to misrepresent the truth.”</td>
<td>因此，如果一個人發表了一個單純無惡意的聲明，可以被解釋為暗示對上人法的主張，而沒有明確提及這樣的境界，那麼無論其他人如何解釋它，如果一個人的目的不是吹噓或聲稱該境界，那就沒有犯戒。然而，如果這個推論是有意的──而且是故意的扭曲──那麼這裡的意圖因素就會得到滿足。至於那些明確提及上人法的不實陳述，例如「我已證得第四禪」，顯然是有意圖的推論，因此這些自然就滿足了「意圖歪曲事實」的因素。</td>

In other words, one must want one’s statement to be taken seriously. This means that motive is an essential part of this factor. To make a self-deprecating, sarcastic joke referring to one’s non-existent superior human attainments as if they were existent, but not intending to be taken seriously, would not fulfill the factor of intention here, regardless of how one’s listeners took the remark. However, because such a remark is a falsehood, it would fall under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>, even though made in jest. For this reason, cases of this sort are not mentioned in the non-offense clauses under this rule because they do carry a pācittiya offense. However, even though the penalty they carry is relatively minor, jokes of this sort should not be viewed lightly. Not only can they lead to serious misunderstandings among one’s listeners, but they also betray an off-handed disrespect for the Dhamma, and in particular for the attainments that a bhikkhu should view as among the highest means and ends of his training.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga discusses two sets of cases in which the factor of understanding plays a role in determining the offense. In the first set, bhikkhus intend to lie about attaining one superior human state (such as the second jhāna) but actually lie about attaining another one (such as the third). In the second set, they make claims about attainments, explicitly mentioning an attainment but not explicitly mentioning themselves (e.g., a bhikkhu, referring to the dwelling in which he lives, says, “Those who live in this dwelling are arahants”). Given that understanding plays a role here, the question is: Whose understanding is at issue here, the speaker’s or the listener’s? The Commentary assumes the listener’s understanding to be at issue. Furthermore—despite the Vibhaṅga’s applying this factor only to these two sets—the Commentary extrapolates from them to say that this condition applies to <em>all</em> cases covered by this rule: The listener must understand what the bhikkhu is saying for there to be a full offense.</td>
<td>《經分別》討論了兩組情況，其中理解因素在確定犯戒時發揮了作用。在第一組中，比丘意圖謊稱證得一種上人法（如第二禪），但實際上卻謊稱證得另一種上人法（如第三禪）。在第二組中，他們宣稱自己的成就，明確提及成就，但沒有明確提及自己（例如，一位比丘，指他所居住的住所，說：「居住在該住所的人是阿羅漢」）。鑑於理解在這裡發揮著作用，問題是：誰的理解是這裡爭議中的問題，是說者的還是聽者的？《義註》假設涉及聽眾的理解。此外，儘管《經分別》僅將此因素應用於這兩組，但《義註》從它們推斷出，這一狀況適用於本戒條所涵蓋的<em>所有</em>情況：聽者必須理解比丘所說的內容，才能構成完全的違犯。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This interpretation, however, appears to be based on a misreading of the Canon. Under other rules where the question of the listener’s understanding is a factor—such as the rules for disrobing and Saṅghādisesa 3—the pattern in the Vibhaṅga is to state explicitly, “If he understands,” “If he doesn’t understand,” “She didn’t understand,” with the “he” or “she” in a different case than that of the participles describing the bhikkhu. Here, however, when the Vibhaṅga mentions the factor of understanding, it uses a present participle in the same case as the participle describing the person speaking: <em>sampajāna-musā bhaṇantassa paṭivijānantassa āpatti pārājikassa</em>—“For the one speaking a deliberate lie and understanding (it as such), an offense of defeat” and so forth. (Some have suggested that the <em>paṭivijānantassa</em> in this phrase is an example of the genitive absolute, which would apply to a different agent than the main agent of the sentence. However, the syntax of the sentence and the placement of the word do not follow the pattern for the genitive absolute, which has to be composed of a noun and a participle set apart from the rest of the sentence.) This means that the participle for “understanding” refers to the same person referred to as “speaking”: In other words, it refers to the bhikkhu, and not to the listener, who is nowhere mentioned in the passage.</td>
<td>然而，這種解釋似乎是基於對《聖典》的誤讀。在其他戒條中，聽者的理解問題是一個因素，例如還俗和《僧殘》三的戒條，《經分別》中的模式是明確敘述，「如果他理解」，「如果他不理解」，「她不理解」，「他」或「她」的情況與描述比丘的分詞不同。然而，在這裡，當《經分別》提到理解因素時，它使用了現在分詞，其情況與描述說者的分詞相同：<em>sampajāna-musā bhaṇantassa paṭivijānantassa āpatti pārājikassa</em>——「對於那些故意說謊和理解的人（就其本身而言），《波羅夷》罪」等等。（有些人認為這個措辭中的 <em>paṭivijānantassa</em> 是所有格獨立句的一個例子，它適用於與句子的主要動作發出者不同的動作發出者。但是，句子的語法和單字的位置並不遵循所有格獨立句的模式，它必須由一個名詞和一個與句子其餘部分分開的分詞組成。）這意味著「理解」的分詞指的是與「說話」相同的人：換句話說，它指的是比丘，而不是指聽者，這段經文中沒有提到聽者。<!-- https://www.chioulaoshi.org/BGreek/glossary.html 文法名稱英漢對照表 -->

</tr>
<tr><td>In the first set of cases—where the bhikkhu means to lay false claim to one superior human state but actually lays false claim to another—if he does not realize that he has made a slip of the tongue, the statement would not normally count as a conscious lie, as he is not aware of what he is saying at the moment he is saying it. Because he is not paying attention to his words, he should not receive the full penalty. However, if he is alert enough to know what he is saying, then—as the Commentary points out—all the factors of an offense are present. Because both his intended and his actual statements are corrupt, he should not be allowed to avoid the penalty simply because of a brief slip of the tongue. Thus, the Vibhaṅga assigns a pārājika in cases of this sort if the bhikkhu is aware of what he is saying, and a thullaccaya if not.</td>
<td>在第一組情況下，比丘本意對一個上人法提出虛假主張，但實際上卻對另一個上人法提出虛假主張，如果他沒有意識到自己失言了，那麼該陳述通常不會被視為是有意識的謊言，因為他當時並不知道自己在說什麼。因為他沒有注意自己的言論，所以他不應該受到全額懲罰。然而，如果他足夠警覺，知道自己在說什麼，那麼——正如《義註》所指出的——犯戒的所有因素都存在。由於他的意圖和實際陳述都是墮落的，因此不應允許他僅僅因為短暫的失言而逃避懲罰。因此，如果比丘知道自己在說什麼，《經分別》在這種情況下會指派《波羅夷》罪，如果不知道，則指派《偷蘭遮》罪。</td>

<tr><td>In the second set of cases, where the bhikkhu’s remarks concern a superior human state explicitly but himself only implicitly, he deserves a heavier penalty if he is aware of the implicit connection than if he is not. Thus the Vibhaṅga assigns a thullaccaya if he is, and a dukkaṭa if not.</td>
<td>在第二組情況下，比丘的言論明確地涉及上人法，但只是隱含地涉及他自己，如果他意識到這種隱含的聯繫，那麼他應該比沒有意識到而受到更重的懲罰。因此，如果他意識到，《經分別》指派《偷蘭遮》罪，如果沒意識到，則指派《突吉羅》罪。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td><em>Understanding</em>, according to the Commentary, means simply that the listener hears the statement clearly enough to know that it is a claim. Whether he/she understands the names for the states claimed—jhāna, clairvoyance, clairaudience, or whatever—is not an issue. The same is true of whether he/she believes the statement to be true or false. If the listener to whom an explicit claim to a superior human state is directed does not understand it, but a passer-by does, the penalty is still a pārājika.</td>
<td>根據《義註》，<em>理解</em>僅僅意味著聽者足夠清楚地聽到該陳述，從而知道它是一個主張。他/她是否理解所聲稱的境界名稱——禪那、天眼、天耳或其他什麼——都不是問題。無論他/她相信該陳述是真是假，情況也是如此。如果聽聞明確主張上人法的聽眾不理解，但路人理解，則懲罰仍然是《波羅夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if the listener does not hear the bhikkhu clearly enough to catch all he says, the penalty is a thullaccaya. If the listener at first has some doubt as to what the bhikkhu said but later realizes that it was a claim to a superior human state, the offense is still a thullaccaya. If the listener does not hear the bhikkhu at all, the Commentary—probably extrapolating from the Vinīta-vatthu cases concerning bhikkhus speaking in private—gives the bhikkhu a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《義註》補充說，如果聽者沒有聽清比丘的聲音，無法聽清他所說的一切，則懲罰是《偷蘭遮》。如果聽者起初對比丘所說的話有一些疑問，但後來意識到這是聲稱上人法，仍然是犯《偷蘭遮》罪。如果聽者根本沒有聽到比丘的聲音，《義註》——可能是從有關比丘私下講話的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例中推斷出來的——就會給予比丘《突吉羅》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu makes a claim to a superior human state in which he mentions himself only implicitly—e.g., “The bhikkhus you support are non-returners”—the Commentary follows a similar pattern in assigning offenses: a thullaccaya if the listener understands, a dukkaṭa if he/she doesn’t, a dukkaṭa if he/she doesn’t even hear the claim.</td>
<td>如果比丘聲稱上人法，而他只是含蓄地提到自己——例如，「你所供養的比丘是不還者」——《義註》則遵循類似的模式來指派違犯：如果聽者理解，則為《偷蘭遮》；如果他/她不理解，則為《突吉羅》；如果他/她甚至沒有聽到該聲稱，則為《突吉羅》。</td>

<tr><td>2) Bhikkhus, hoping that people will esteem them, engage in special practices—the examples given in the Vinīta-vatthu include living in the jungle, going for alms, sitting, standing, walking, and lying down (apparently in meditation for long periods of time), but from them we can extrapolate to other practices such as any of the ascetic (dhutaṅga) practices or vegetarianism, etc., followed so as to impress others. The penalty: a dukkaṭa. Because this ruling might give the mistaken impression that one should not adopt the dhutaṅga practices or engage in long periods of sitting, etc., the Commentary includes a list of blameless reasons for living in the wilderness: seeing that village-dwelling makes one’s mind restless, desiring seclusion, desiring to attain arahantship, reflecting that the Buddha praised living in the wilderness, anticipating that one will be a good example to one’s fellows in the holy life. A bhikkhu who undertakes any of the dhutaṅga practices for these or similar reasons would incur no offense.</td>

Thus, as the cloth was ownerless, the resident bhikkhu had incurred not a pārājika, but simply some dukkaṭas for the preliminary efforts with intention to steal.</td>
