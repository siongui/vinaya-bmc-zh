</tr>
<tr><td>Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: <em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em> (consumables) and <em>khādaniya</em> (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term <em>staple</em> here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.</td>
<td>本章中的許多戒條將食物分為兩類：<em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em>（噉食）和<em>khādaniya</em>（嚼食）。學者通常將兩者翻譯為「較軟的食物」和「較硬的食物」，儘管特定食物的軟硬程度與其所屬類別關係不大。更貼近每個類別本質的翻譯是「主食」和「副食」。兩者之間的差異至關重要，因為它往往是決定什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒的因素。但請注意，此處的「<em>主食</em>」一詞僅涵蓋佛陀時代被認為是主食的食物。麵包、義大利麵和馬鈴薯在西方是主食，但在當時的印度並非一直都是主食，因此並不總是屬於這一類別。</td>

<em>1) Cooked grains:</em> The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc35">Pc 35</a> defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are <em>sāḷi</em> (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); <em>vīhi</em> (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); <em>yava</em> (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); <em>godhūma</em> (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); <em>kaṅgu</em> (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); <em>varaka</em> (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and <em>kudrūsaka</em> (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.</div>

<em>1）煮熟的穀物：</em><a class="reference external" href="#Pc35">《波逸提》三五</a>的《義註》將其定義為七種煮熟的穀物，但對於其中某些穀物的定義存在分歧。它們是 <em>sāḷi</em> （《戒律書》將其譯為米，泰國人譯為小麥）； <em>vīhi</em> （《戒律書》仍將其譯為米，泰國人也同意）； <em>yava</em> （《戒律書》將其譯為大麥，泰國人譯為糯米）； <em>godhūma</em> （《戒律書》將其譯為小麥，泰國佛教徒譯為稗子）； <em>kaṅgu</em> （《戒律書》和泰國人均將其譯為小米或高粱）； <em>varaka</em> （《戒律書》僅說其為豆類之外沒有確認，泰國人將其譯為薏米，這可能是正確的）；以及 <em>kudrūsaka</em> （《義註》將其定義為涵蓋所有來自草類的穀物——在西方，黑麥是一個例子）。然而，無論這些術語的確切定義是什麼，我們都可以從《四大教示》中論證，任何作為主食烹飪的穀物——包括玉米和燕麥——都屬於這一類。</div>

<tr><td><div class="mx-2 first last docutils container">
<em>2) Kummāsa:</em> The Commentary describes this as a staple confection made out of <em>yava</em> but doesn’t give any further details aside from saying that if the <em>kummāsa</em> is made out of any of the other grains or mung beans, it doesn’t count as a staple food. References to <em>kummāsa</em> in the Canon show that it was a very common staple that could form a rudimentary meal in and of itself and would spoil if left overnight.</div>

<em>5）肉類：</em>指任何陸地動物的肉，但禁止食用的除外。由於《義註》在討論禁止食用的肉類時，使用「<em>肉</em>」一詞來指稱動物身體的所有部位，因此同樣的慣例也適用於允許食用的肉類（以及魚類）。因此，它涵蓋了任何允許食用的動物的肝臟、腎臟、蛋類等。</div>

<tr><td>The Mahāvagga (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.23.9">Mv.VI.23.9-15</a>) forbids ten kinds of flesh: that of human beings, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas. To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkaṭa. Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive (“People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting’”) or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion’s flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there, instead of criticizing or complaining, attacked them).</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds three comments here: (a) These prohibitions cover not only the meat of these animals but also their blood, bones, skin, and hide (the layer of tissue just under the skin—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_113.html">AN 4:113</a>). (b) The prohibition against dog flesh does not include wild dogs, such as wolves and foxes, (but many teachers—including the Thai translator of the Commentary—question this point). The flesh of a half-dog half-wolf mixture, however, would be forbidden. (c) The prohibition against snake flesh covers the flesh of all long, footless beings. Thus eels would not be allowed. (Many Communities question this last point as well.)</td>
<td>《義註》在此補充了三點評論： (a) 這些禁令不僅涵蓋這些動物的肉，還涵蓋它們的血、骨、皮和獸皮（皮下組織層－參見<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/04.html#%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%89%E9%A6%AC%E5%88%BA">《增支部》4:113經</a>）。 (b) 禁止食用狗肉的規定並不包括狼和狐狸等野狗（但許多導師——包括《義註》的泰文譯者——對此表示質疑）。然而，半狗半狼混血的肉是被禁止的。 (c) 禁止食用蛇肉的規定涵蓋所有長而無足的生物的肉。因此，鰻魚是不允許的。（許多僧團也對最後一點表示質疑。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.23.9">Mv.VI.23.9</a> also states that if a bhikkhu is uncertain as to the identity of any meat presented to him, he incurs a dukkaṭa if he doesn’t ask the donor what it is before eating it. The Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, on reflection, one recognizes what kind of meat it is, one needn’t ask the donor about the identity of the meat. If one doesn’t recognize it, one <em>must</em> ask. If one mistakenly identifies an unallowable sort of meat as allowable and then goes ahead and consumes it under that mistaken assumption, there is no offense.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_006/#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9</a> 也規定，如果比丘不確定提供給自己的肉是什麼，並且在食用前沒有詢問施主，犯《突吉羅》。《義註》對此的解釋是，如果經過深思熟慮後，認出了是什麼肉，就無需詢問施主是什麼肉。如果認不出，就<em>必須</em>詢問。如果比丘錯誤地將不允許的肉認定為可允許的肉，並基於這種錯誤的認知繼續食用，則不構成犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>Raw flesh and blood are allowed at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.10.2">Mv.VI.10.2</a> only when one is possessed by non-human beings. Thus, in more ordinary circumstances, one may not eat raw fish or meat even if of an allowable kind. This would include such things as steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, raw eggs, and caviar. Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.31.14">Mv.VI.31.14</a>).</td>

Any of these items ordinarily used as medicines, though, would not be classed as a non-staple food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="#Pc37">《波逸提》三七</a>的《義註》將以下物品列為副食：麵粉和麵粉製成的甜點（不含雞蛋的蛋糕、麵包和義大利麵也歸入此類）；此外，根、塊莖（包括馬鈴薯）、蓮藕、芽、莖、樹皮、葉子、花、果實、堅果、種子粉、種子以及製成食物的樹脂。然而，任何這些通常用作藥物之物均不屬於副食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also acknowledges that some societies use roots, tubers, confections made out of flour, etc., as staple foods, but it nowhere suggests that the definition of staple food be altered to fit the society in which one is living. However—because eggs come under meat—any bread, pastries, noodles, and pasta made with eggs are staple foods. Thus in the West we are left with a somewhat zigzag line separating what are and are not staple foods for the purposes of the rules: Meal pounded from grain is a staple; flour ground from grain is not. Bread made with oat meal, corn meal, wheat germ, etc., would thus be a staple; bread made without any grain meal or eggs would not. The same holds true for pastries, noodles, and pasta.</td>
<td>《義註》也承認有些社會使用根莖類植物、麵粉製成的甜點等作為主食，但並未暗示應根據個人所處的社會環境改變主食的定義。然而，由於雞蛋屬於肉類，任何用雞蛋製成的麵包、糕點、麵條和義大利麵都屬於主食。因此，在西方，就戒條而言，主食和副食的劃分存在一條略顯曲折的界線：穀物搗碎的粗糧是主食；穀物磨成的麵粉則不是。因此，用燕麥粉、玉米粉、小麥胚芽等製成的麵包是主食；不含穀物粉或雞蛋的麵包則不是主食。糕點、麵條和義大利麵也是如此。</td>

<tr><td>In discussing the Great Standards, the Commentary says that grain is a “great fruit,” and thus the juice of any one of nine large fruits—palmyra fruit, coconut, jackfruit, breadfruit, bottle gourd, white gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, and squash—would fall under the same class as the juice of grain: i.e., as a non-staple food and not a juice drink. From this judgment, many Communities infer that the juice of <em>any</em> large fruit, such as pineapple or grapefruit, would also be classed as a non-staple food. However, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point, as the allowance for juice-drinks states specifically that the juice of all fruits is allowed except for that of grain.</td>

Health drinks such as wheat grass juice would thus be allowable. Leaf-juice may be mixed with cold water and/or warmed in the sunlight. The prohibition against consuming the juice from cooked vegetables in the afternoon covers all cooked leaves that are considered food, as well as any medicinal leaves cooked in liquids that are classed as food, such as milk. Medicinal leaves cooked in pure water retain their classification as lifetime medicines.</td>
<td>根據《義註》，允許的葉汁飲料包括從被視為食物的葉子（例如生菜、菠菜或甜菜葉）以及被歸類為藥物的葉子榨出的汁。因此，例如小麥草汁等健康飲品是允許的。葉汁可以用冷水混合和/或在陽光下加熱。禁止在下午飲用煮熟的蔬菜汁的規定涵蓋所有被視為食物的煮熟葉子，以及任何在被歸類為食物的液體（例如牛奶）中煮熟的藥用葉子。用純水煮熟的藥用葉子仍保留其終身藥物的分類。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s discussion of flower juice drinks allowable and unallowable for the afternoon shows that licorice flower juice was used to make alcohol, which is why the Canon doesn’t include it as allowable in this class. The Commentary extends this prohibition to cover any kind of flower juice prepared in such a way that it will become alcoholic. The Commentary goes on to say, though, that licorice flower juice and other flower juices <em>not</em> prepared so that they will become toddy are allowable in the morning.</td>
<td>《義註》討論了下午允許和不允許的花汁飲料，顯示甘草花汁曾被用來釀酒，因此《聖典》並未將其列入允許的此類飲品。《義註》將這項禁令擴展至涵蓋任何經過調製後會變成酒精的花汁。不過，《義註》繼續指出，甘草花汁和其他<em>未</em>經調製成棕櫚酒的花汁在早上是允許的。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes further that if a bhikkhu himself makes any of the juice drinks, he may consume it only before noon. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered before noon, one may “also” drink it with food before noon—the “also” here implying that the original allowance, that one may drink it without food after noon and before dawnrise, still holds. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered after noon, one may drink it without food until the following dawnrise. The allowance for mango juice drink covers juice made either from ripe or from unripe mangoes. To make unripe mango juice, it recommends that the mango be cut or broken into small pieces, placed in water, heated in sunlight, and then strained, adding honey, sugar, and/or camphor as desired. Juice made from <em>Bassia pierrei</em> must be diluted with water, as the undiluted juice of this fruit is too thick.</td>
<td>《義註》進一步指出，如果比丘自己做任何果汁飲料，他只能在中午前飲用。如果果汁是由非比丘製作並在中午之前正式地供養，則比丘「也」可以在中午之前與食物一起飲用——這裡的「也」意味著原來的開緣仍然有效，即可以在中午之後和黎明之前不帶食物地飲用。如果果汁是由非比丘製作並在中午之後正式地供養，則比丘可以在第二天黎明之前不帶食物地飲用。芒果汁飲料的允許範圍涵蓋成熟或未成熟芒果製成的果汁。要製作未成熟芒果汁，建議將芒果切成或掰成小塊，放入水中，在陽光下加熱，然後過濾，並根據需要添加蜂蜜、糖和/或樟腦。用<em>芒果椴樹（Bassia pierrei）</em>製成的果汁必須用水稀釋，因為這種水果的未稀釋果汁太濃稠。</td>

If butter is placed on top of rice porridge, the part of the butter that hasn’t melted into the rice may be kept and eaten for seven days.

<tr><td>Translated in this way, the passage covers foods that are already mixed when presented to a bhikkhu. One of the general issues that led to the convening of the Second Council, however, concerned how to treat cases where foods received separately are then mixed by a bhikkhu. The specific issue presented to the Council was that of bhikkhus who kept a horn filled with salt so that they could add salt to bland foods. The Council’s verdict was that in doing so, the bhikkhus incurred a pācittiya under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>. The Vibhaṅga to that rule, however, gives a dukkaṭa for using, as food, life-long medicine that has been stored overnight, and salt is a life-long medicine. Thus the elders at the Council seem to have reasoned that if the salt has been mixed in with food, the mixture as a whole counts as food accepted when the first ingredient (the salt) was accepted: thus the pācittiya, rather than the dukkaṭa, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>.

<tr><td>The question the Commentary then raises is, “Why is the word ‘that day’ <em>(tadahu)</em> omitted from the last case?” Its answer is that there is no limit on when the medicine has to be received for it to be properly mixed with a tonic received today. In other words, it could have been received any number of days before the tonic was received. If it is mixed with the tonic on the first day of the tonic’s life span, the mixture as a whole has a seven-day life span. If mixed with the tonic on the second day of the tonic’s life, the mixture has a six-day life span, and so forth. The Commentary’s translation of this passage may strain standard Pali syntax, but it is grammatically correct and is the only way of deriving from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.40.3">Mv.VI.40.3</a> a general principle to cover the issue of foods received separately that are then mixed by a bhikkhu. Thus the principle has been generally accepted that tonics and medicines, such as sugar and salt, received today may be eaten mixed with food or juice drinks received today, but not with food or juice drinks received on a later day. Medicine, such as salt, tea, or cocoa, received at any time may be eaten mixed with any of the five tonics on any day of the tonic’s life span.</td>
<td>《義註》接下來提出的問題是：「為什麼在最後一種情況下省略了『當天』<em>（tadahu）</em>這個詞？」答案是，沒有限制何時接受藥物以便將其與今天接受的補品適當地混合。換句話說，它可以是在接受補品之前的任何天接受的。如果它在補品的有效期的第一天與補品混合，則混合物作為一個整體擁有七天的有效期。如果在補品有效期的第二天與補品混合，則混合物擁有六天的有效期，依此類推。《義註》對這段話的翻譯可能不符合標準巴利句法，但在語法上是正確的，並且是從<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_006/#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a> 中得出涵蓋比丘分開接受然後混合食物問題的一般原則的唯一方法。因此，普遍接受的原則是：今天接受的補品和藥物（例如糖和鹽）可以與今天收到的食物或果汁飲料混合食用，但不能與之後的日期裡接受的食物或果汁飲料混合食用。任何時間接受的藥物（例如鹽、茶或可可）都可以與五種補品中的任何一種在補品有效期內的任何一天混合食用。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s conclusion, though, creates a problem when lay people want to invite Communities of more than three bhikkhus to their homes for a meal. Perhaps this problem is what induced the Commentary to interpret the Vibhaṅga’s definition of a <em>group meal</em> as meaning one in which the invitations specifically mention the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em>, or the type of meal or food to be served. (“Come to my house for breakfast tomorrow.” “I know you don’t often get a chance to eat Indian food, so I’m inviting you all over for chappatties and curry.”) This interpretation has led to the custom of phrasing invitations to eat “in the morning” or to eat “before noon,” so that groups of four or more bhikkhus may be invited without breaking this rule.</td>
<td>然而，《義註》的結論卻帶來了一個問題：當在家眾想邀請超過三位比丘的僧團到家中用餐時，就會出現問題。或許正是這個問題促使《義註》將《經分別》對「<em>結眾食</em>」的定義解讀為，邀請中明確提到「<em>餐</em>」或「<em>食物</em>」一詞，或具體提供餐食或食物種類。（「明天來我家吃早餐。」「我知道你們不常有機會吃印度菜，所以我邀請你們全部來吃印度薄餅和咖哩。」）這種解讀導致了邀請措辭中出現「早上」吃或「中午之前」吃的習慣，這樣，邀請四位或四位以上的比丘團體也不會違反這條戒條。</td>

<tr><td>The Buddha’s purposes for establishing this rule, though, are listed at Cv.VII.3.13 as follows: “For the restraint of evil-minded individuals, for the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, so that those with evil desires will not split the Community by (forming) a faction, and out of compassion for families.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of <em>group meal</em> accomplishes none of these purposes: The custom of phrasing invitations to avoid the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em> does nothing to restrain evil-minded individuals, etc., and it actually creates trouble for lay people who do not know the custom, a point well-illustrated by the Commentary itself in an entertaining section on how to deal with a person whose invitation contains the word <em>meal</em>. After getting the run-around from the meal designator—who apparently was not allowed to tell him in any straightforward way how to phrase his invitation and so gave him a long series of hints—the poor man returns to his friends and makes a cryptic statement that the A/Sub-commentary translates as: “There are a lot of words that have to be spoken in this business of making an invitation.

<td><strong>另一種解釋</strong></td>

<tr><td>To find an alternative to the Commentary’s explanation, we have to go back to the origin stories leading to the reformulations of the rule, where we find an interesting point: The invitations rejected by scrupulous bhikkhus on the grounds that they would break the rule all deal with “invitational” meals. In one of them, a naked ascetic invites a group of bhikkhus to an invitational meal and is rejected on the grounds that it would constitute a group meal. He then goes to the Buddha and—after complaining that he should not be subjected to such treatment—rephrases the invitation, this time inviting the entire Community. This suggests that he felt an invitation of this sort would not constitute a group meal.</td>
<td>為了找到與《義註》不同的解釋，我們必須追溯導致戒條被重新制定的起源故事，在那裡我們發現了一個有趣的點：那些被嚴謹的比丘們以違反戒戒為由拒絕的邀請，都與「邀請」食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「別請食」]</span>有關。其中一則故事中，一位裸體苦行僧<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「裸形外道」]</span>邀請一群比丘參加邀請食，卻被拒絕，理由是這會構成結眾食。他隨後來到佛陀面前，在抱怨自己不應遭受這種待遇之後，重新措辭了邀請，這次邀請的是整個僧團。這表明，他認為這種邀請不構成結眾食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>His reasoning has its grounds in the Vinaya itself: Throughout the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas, the word <em>group</em> is used to refer to any set of bhikkhus not forming a complete Community and yet acting as an independent unit. This may be why the category of Community meal was not mentioned in the non-offense clauses: The arrangers of the Vibhaṅga may have felt that no mention was necessary, in that the term <em>group</em> meal automatically excluded Community meals.</td>
<td>他的推論在戒律中自有其依據：在《經分別》和《犍度》中，「<em>結眾</em>」一詞被用來指任何未組成完整僧團，但仍作為獨立單位行動的比丘群體。這或許就是為什麼在不犯條款中沒有提及僧團食這個類別的原因：《經分別》的編纂者可能認為沒有必要提及，因為「<em>結眾</em>」一詞自動排除了僧團食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Similar considerations suggest that designated meals may also be exempted from this rule even though they are not mentioned in the non-offense clauses. Invitations to such meals were customarily worded as requests for so-and-so many bhikkhus “from the Community,” and thus—as a type of Community meal—they would by definition not be invitations to a “group” meal.</td>
<td>類似的考慮表明，即使不犯條款中未提及指定食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「僧次請食」]</span>，也可不受此戒條約束。此類餐食的邀請習慣措詞為「來自僧團」的某某多少比丘的請求，因此，作為一種僧團食，它們從定義上來說並非「結眾」食的邀請。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because invitations to lottery meals and periodic meals did not customarily make reference to the Community, the Vibhaṅga arrangers did have to make mention of those types of meals in order to exempt them.</td>
<td>由於抽籤食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「行籌食」]</span>和週期食的邀請通常不會提及僧團，因此《經分別》的編纂者必須提及這些類型的餐食才能免除它們。</td>

<tr><td><em>We are left with a rule that applies exclusively to invitations to specific groups—not Communities—of four or more bhikkhus regardless of whether the invitation mentions the word “food” or “meal.”</em></td>
<td><em>我們剩下的戒條只適用於對四名或四名以上比丘的特定群體（而非僧團）的邀請，無論邀請中是否提到「食物」或「餐」一詞。</em></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form has the virtue of fulfilling the express purposes mentioned for it in Cv.VII.3.13: It would prevent evil-minded bhikkhus and lay people from trying to exert influence over specific groups in the Community by arranging meals especially for them; and in the same way, it would prevent people with evil desires from creating a split in the Community. (Because the smallest faction that can create a split in the Community is four bhikkhus, the maximum number allowed at a group meal is three.)</td>
<td>這種形式的戒條，其優點在於能夠實現<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_017/#0268a04">《小品》.七.3.13</a> 中明確提及的目的：它可以防止心懷惡欲的比丘和在家眾，試圖透過專門為僧團中的特定群體安排餐食來對他們施加影響；同樣，它也可以防止心懷惡欲的人在僧團中製造分裂。（由於能夠造成僧團分裂的最小派系是四位比丘，因此結眾食允許的最大人數是三人。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form would also contribute to the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus in that invitations to meals would not be preempted by factions; and it would protect lay families from being prey to the maneuverings of bhikkhus who would pressure them repeatedly into providing meals as part of their strategy to create and maintain such factions. (Anyone who has lived in a traditional Buddhist country knows only too well the influence of sweet-talking bhikkhus over unsuspecting or low-minded lay people. This sort of thing neither started nor ended with Devadatta.)</td>
<td>這種形式的戒條也能讓品行端正的比丘們感到樂住，因為用餐邀請不會被派系搶先；它還能保護在家人免受比丘們的計謀的侵害。比丘們會反覆施壓，要求他們提供餐食，以此作為製造和維持派系的策略之一。（任何在傳統佛教國家生活過的人都深知甜言蜜語的比丘們對毫無戒心或心境低下的在家人的影響。提婆達多既不是這種事的開端，也不是終結。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because Community meals and designated meals would not form an opening for such machinations, there would be no reason to limit them to groups of three if lay people want to invite groups larger than that. One objection to exempting Community meals from this rule is that a meal for the entire Community would be more burdensome than a meal for a smaller group, but that is what designated meals are for. A donor willing and able to provide a meal for an entire Community is welcome but not required to do so. A donor willing but not able may simply ask to provide a meal for x-number of bhikkhus from the Community, leaving it up to the meal designator to designate which bhikkhus will go for the meal, with no danger of creating a faction.</td>
<td>因為僧團食和指定食不會為此類陰謀提供機會，所以如果在家眾想邀請比三人更多的團體，沒有理由將其限制在三人以內。有人反對將僧團食排除在這條戒條之外，因為為整個僧團提供一餐比為一小群人提供一餐更有負擔，但指定食就是為了滿足這一需求。願意且有能力為整個僧團供餐的布施者歡迎但不強制要求這樣做。願意但無力提供的布施者可以直接要求為僧團中的x位比丘供餐，由餐食指定者指定哪些比丘來享用這餐，這樣就不會有分裂的危險。</td>

<tr><td><em>Thus the point at issue is not whether the invitation makes mention of food or meals, but whether it specifies the individual bhikkhus to be invited.</em> If it specifies more than three individual bhikkhus—either naming them outright or saying such things as “Ven. X and four of his friends,” or “The five of you,” etc.—the meal would count as a group meal.</td>
<td><em>因此，問題的關鍵不在於邀請中是否提及食物或餐，而在於是否指定受邀的比丘。</em>如果邀請指定三位以上的比丘——無論是直接點名，還是諸如「X尊者和他的四位朋友」或「你們五位」之類的說法——那麼這餐就算是結眾食。</td>

<em>A meal supplied by monks</em> is one provided by a person who has taken on the state of religious wanderer.

This exemption, as its origin story makes clear, was formulated to promote good relations between bhikkhus and members of other religions, but it also means that a bhikkhu, from his own resources, can provide food for a group of his friends without incurring an offense.

<td>至於被邀請去用一頓餐的比丘卻去了另一頓餐的該類輾轉食，佛陀在與此戒條附屬的一個故事中允許分享邀請：如果一位比丘收到了邀請，他可以將其給予另一個比丘或沙彌，說：「我把我的用餐期望給予某某。」然後，他就被允許在其他地方吃了。</td>

<tr><td>In addition to mentioning the “proper times” during which one may eat an out-of-turn meal, the non-offense clauses state that there is no penalty for a bhikkhu who, on receiving an invitation, states, “I will go for alms.” This statement the Commentary explains as a refusal, and interprets the allowance as meaning that if a bhikkhu refuses an invitation, he is still allowed to eat another meal at the time for which the invitation was made. If the Vibhaṅga arrangers did mean this statement to be a refusal, though, it is probably for the sake of those bhikkhus who hold to the <em>dhutaṅga</em> vow of going for alms and not accepting invitations. If a bhikkhu who does not hold to such a vow refuses an invitation for a time for which he has no prior commitment, it is considered very bad manners. And if he were later to accept an invitation for a meal served at the same time as the meal he earlier refused, it would be extremely bad manners.</td>
<td>除了提到可以吃輾轉食的「適時」外，不犯條款還規定，如果比丘在收到邀請時說「我要去托缽」則沒有懲罰。《義註》將此語句解釋為拒絕，並將這項開緣解釋為，如果比丘拒絕邀請，他仍然被允許在邀請的時間用另一餐。如果《經分別》的編纂者確實將此聲明代表為拒絕，那麼，這可能是為了那些持守<em>頭陀行</em>誓言、去托缽而不接受邀請的比丘們。如果一位沒有持守此誓言的比丘拒絕在他沒有事先承諾的時間的邀請，則會被認為很不禮貌。而且如果他後來接受了與他之前拒絕的餐食同時提供的用餐邀請，那將是極其地不禮貌。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>An alternative explanation for the statement, “I will go for alms,” is that there is no offense if the bhikkhu lets the donor know beforehand that he will go for alms before the meal: He can have his alms meal first and then go to receive the meal offered by the donor. This would make room for the custom common in village monasteries throughout Theravādin countries, where invitations are usually for the late-morning meal, and bhikkhus are expected to have an early-morning alms meal before that. (If this interpretation does not hold, most village bhikkhus would then probably claim a perpetual “time of illness” as their exemption from this rule.)</td>
<td>「我要去托缽」這句話的另一種解釋是，如果比丘事先告知施主他將在餐食之前去托缽，則並無犯戒：他可以先吃托缽所得之食，然後再去接受施主供養餐食。這可以解釋上座部佛教國家村莊寺院中常見的習俗：通常邀請享用上午晚些時候的餐食，而比丘則應該在那之前享用一頓清晨的托缽所得之食。（如果這種解釋不成立，那麼大多數村莊比丘可能會聲稱自己有一段不斷重複的「生病時」，以此作為此戒條的豁免。）</td>

<tr><td>Meals that do not include any of the five staple foods are also exempted from this rule.

<td>不含五種主食的餐食也不受此戒條約束。因此，如果受邀請赴餐食，並在之前吃點牛奶、喝稀粥、水果等零食，則不構成犯戒——不過，為了符合此戒條的精神，不應吃太多，以免影響用餐時的胃口。</td>

<td>如果在同一天收到多份餐食邀請，並按照收到邀請的順序前往就餐（但參見<a class="reference external" href="#Pc35">《波逸提》三五</a>），則不構成犯戒；如果將接收的各個邀請的食物一起放在缽裡，同時吃掉；或者，如果收到全村人的邀請，去村裡任何地方吃飯。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, in discussing this point, mentions a situation that often occurs where there are very few bhikkhus in proportion to the number of donors: A bhikkhu has been invited to a meal but, before he leaves the monastery to go to the meal, another group of donors arrives with food to place in his bowl; or after he arrives at the home of the original donor, another group of donors arrives with still more food. According to the Commentary he may accept the food of these various donors as long as he is careful—when he finally eats—to take his first mouthful from the food offered by the original donor.</td>
<td>《義註》在討論這一點時提到了一種常見的情況，即比丘的數量相對於施主的數量來說非常少：一位比丘受邀赴餐食，但在他離開寺院去赴餐之前，另一群施主帶著食物來到並放入他的缽中；或者在他到達最先的施主家後，又有一群施主帶著更多的食物到來。根據《義註》，他可以接受這些施主的食物，只要當他在最終進食時小心地在第一口食物時吃掉最先的施主供養的食物即可。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The non-offense clauses also state that periodic meals and lottery meals do not count as out-of-turn meals under this rule, but the Vibhaṅga offers no explanation as to why. The Commentary to Cullavagga VI.21 shows that the custom was for many families to prepare such meals on the same day. This exemption would thus seem to provide for the situation where there are fewer bhikkhus than there are families preparing these meals. One bhikkhu would be allowed to accept more than one meal so that no family’s meal would go without a recipient.</td>

<tr><td>When a donor invited bhikkhus for a meal, the custom in the time of the Buddha was for him/her to offer food to the bhikkhus repeatedly while they ate, and to stop only when the supplies of food were exhausted or the bhikkhus refused any further offers. (This custom is still widespread in Sri Lanka and Burma.) Thus it was often a matter of pride among donors that their supplies were not easily exhausted and that they could continue offering food until the bhikkhus were completely satisfied and could eat no more. Now, where there is pride there is bound to be wounded pride: A donor could easily feel insulted if bhikkhus refused further offers of food, finished their meal, and then went to eat someplace else.</td>
<td>佛陀時代的習俗是，當布施者邀請比丘們用餐時，布施者會在比丘們用餐時反覆供養食物給比丘們，直到食物耗盡或比丘們拒絕更進一步供養時才停止。（這項習俗在斯里蘭卡和緬甸至今仍盛行。）因此，這往往是布施者的驕傲，因為他們的供養不容易耗盡，而且他們可以繼續供養食物，直到比丘們完全吃飽，再也吃不下為止。然而，哪裡有自尊心，哪裡的自尊心就必然受到傷害：如果比丘們拒絕更進一步供養食物，用完餐後又去其他地方吃東西，布施者很容易感到被冒犯。</td>

<tr><td><em>Having eaten (bhuttāvin)</em>, according to the Vibhaṅga, means having eaten any of the five staple foods, “even as much as a blade of grass.” On the surface, this could mean one of two things: having taken one’s first bite of a meal or having finished a meal—even the smallest possible one. The Commentary adopts the first interpretation, but in doing so creates two problems:</td>
<td>根據《經分別》，<em>「吃過」（bhuttāvin）</em>的意思是吃過五種主食中的任何一種，「哪怕只是一小片草」。表面上，這可能意味著兩種情況之一：用餐吃過第一口或用餐完畢——哪怕是一小口。《義註》採用了第一種解讀，但這樣做卻帶來了兩個問題：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1) If <em>having eaten</em> means having taken one’s first bite of a meal, then the word serves no purpose in the rule, because the first factor of “having turned down an offer of further food” is “the bhikkhu is eating,” and as the Commentary itself notes, if one is eating then one has already taken one’s first bite of the meal. It concludes that the word <em>having eaten</em>, both in the rule and in the Vibhaṅga, is completely superfluous.</td>
<td>1）如果「<em>吃過</em>」的意思是用餐吃過第一口，那麼這個詞在戒條中就毫無意義，因為「<em>已拒絕了更進一步的食物供養</em>」的第一個因素是「比丘正在吃」，而正如《義註》本身所指出的，如果一個人正在吃，那麼該人已經用餐吃過第一口。它得出結論，「吃過」這個詞，無論在戒條中或在《經分別》中，都是完全多餘的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>2) A more practical problem coming from the Commentary’s interpretation is that if one turns down an offer of extra food when one already has more than enough food in one’s bowl but has yet to finish one’s meal, one cannot continue eating. The Commentary tries to get around this predicament by introducing an additional factor: As long as one does not move from the spot on which one is sitting, one may continue eating. This, though, creates further problems: Suppose a bhikkhu has turned down an offer of further food but has yet to finish his meal. If there is then some compelling reason for him to move from the spot on which he is sitting—for example, the donor spills a pot of hot soup, or ants come crawling into his robes—then he cannot finish his meal even if the donor begs him to continue eating.</td>
<td>2）《義註》的解讀引發了一個更實際的問題是，如果缽裡已經有足夠多的食物但還沒吃完，而拒絕了額外的食物供養，那就不能繼續吃。《義註》試圖透過引入一個額外的因素來解決這個困境：只要不離開所坐的位置，就可以繼續吃飯。然而，這又帶來了進一步的問題：假設一位比丘拒絕了更進一步的食物供養但還沒用完餐。如果有某種令人信服的理由迫使他離開所坐的位置——例如，布施者打翻了一鍋熱湯，或者螞蟻爬進了他的袈裟——那麼即使布施者懇求他繼續吃飯，他也不能用完餐。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Sub-commentary gets around the first problem by interpreting <em>having eaten</em> as “having finished a meal,” which fits better with the origin story and with the linguistic usage of the Canon itself. (The word <em>bhuttāvin</em> also appears in MN 91, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.4.3-6">Cv.VIII.4.6</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.11.2-18">Cv.VIII.11.5</a>, where it clearly and consistently means “having finished a meal.” The Canon uses a separate term, <em>asana</em>, for one who is in the process of eating a meal without yet having finished it.) The author of the Sub-commentary doesn’t realize, though, that in adopting this interpretation he is also eliminating the need for the Commentary’s extra factor concerning moving from one’s spot. If the factor is unnecessary and has no basis in the Canon, there seems no reason to adopt it. Thus the Commentary’s factor, and not the wording of the rule, is what is superfluous. So we can say that <em>having eaten</em> means having finished one’s meal, and that the question of having moved from one’s spot doesn’t enter into the rule.</td>
<td>《複註》透過將「<em>吃過</em>」解釋為「用餐完畢」來規避第一個問題，這更符合起源故事和《聖典》本身的語言用法。（ <em>bhuttāvin</em> 一詞也出現在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/091.html">《中部》91經</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0293a07">《小品》.八.4.6</a> 和<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0302a12">《小品》.八.11.5</a> 中，在這些經文中，它明確且一致地表示「用餐完畢」。《聖典》使用了一個單獨的術語 <em>asana</em> 來指正在用餐但尚未完畢的人。）然而，《複註》的作者沒有意識到，透過採用這種解釋，他也消除了《義註》中關於從位置移動的額外因素的需要。如果這個因素是不必要的，而且在《聖典》中沒有依據，那麼似乎也沒有理由採用它。因此，多餘的是《義註》中的因素，而不是戒條的措辭。所以我們可以說，「<em>吃過</em>」意味著已經用餐完畢，而是否離開位置的問題並不在戒條之內。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As the Commentary itself notes when discussing the term <em>asana</em>, the point where one finishes eating is determined in one of two ways:</td>
<td>正如《義註》本身在討論 <em>asana</em> 該術語時所指出的，用餐完畢的時間點是透過以下兩種方式之一來決定的：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>a) There is no food left in one’s bowl, hand, or mouth; or</td>
<td>a）缽裡、手裡或嘴裡沒有食物；或者</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>b) one decides that one has had enough for that particular meal.</td>
<td>b）決定自己已經吃飽了那餐。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, as long as the bhikkhu has not yet finished the donor’s meal, he is free to turn down, accept, and eat food as he likes. In other words, if he turns down an offer of further food, he may continue eating what is left in his bowl. If he initially turns down an offer of further food but then gives in and accepts it after being pressured by the donor, he may eat what he accepts without penalty. Or if he feels, for example, that he has enough vegetables but would like more rice, he may turn down an offer of vegetables yet accept and eat an offer of rice that follows it.</td>
<td>因此，只要比丘尚未吃完施主的供養，他就可以自由地隨意拒絕、接受和食用食物。換句話說，如果他拒絕了施主提供的更多食物，他可以繼續吃缽裡剩下的食物。如果他最初拒絕了施主提供的更多食物，但在施主的催促下屈服並接受了，他可以繼續吃他接受的食物而不受懲罰。或者，例如，如果他覺得蔬菜已經足夠，但想要更多的米飯，他可以拒絕蔬菜的供養，但接受並食用隨後供養的米飯。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>But once he no longer has any food in his bowl, hand, or mouth, or has decided that he has had enough for that particular meal, he fulfills the factor of “having eaten” under this rule. If he turned down an offer of further food before finishing the meal, he may not for the remainder of the day eat any staple or non-staple foods that are not leftovers.</td>
<td>但一旦他的缽裡、手裡或嘴裡沒有食物，或者他決定該餐已經吃飽了，他就滿足了這條戒條下「吃過」的因素。如果他在用完餐之前拒絕了更進一步食物的供養，那麼在當天剩餘的時間裡，他不得吃任何非剩餘的主食或副食。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if the bhikkhu has finished eating before the further food is offered, factor (1) is not fulfilled, so if he turns down the food he does not fall under the terms of this rule. Similarly, if the food in factor (2) is not a staple food—e.g., if it is fruit, chocolates, or cheese—or if it is staple food of a sort unallowable for a bhikkhu to eat—e.g., it has been offered as a result of a bhikkhu’s claiming a superior human state or corrupting a family (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg13">Sg 13</a>), or it is made of human flesh or snake meat, etc.—the factor is not fulfilled. Because none of the texts specify that the donor under factor (3) must be unordained, a bhikkhu offering food to a fellow bhikkhu would apparently fulfill this factor as well. Thus this rule would apply not only to meals offered by lay donors, but also to food handed out by bhikkhus and novices in a monastery.</td>
<td>《義註》補充道，如果比丘在更進一步供養食物之前已經吃完，則不滿足因素（1），因此如果他拒絕食物，則不屬於本戒條的範疇。同樣，如果因素（2）中的食物不是主食（例如，水果、巧克力或奶酪），或者屬於比丘禁食的主食—例如，由於比丘自稱上人法或污家而被供養的（參見<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0011/#Sg13">《僧殘》十三</a>），或者食物由人肉或蛇肉製成等—則不滿足該因素。由於沒有任何文獻明確規定因素（3）中的布施者必須是未出家者，因此，比丘向比丘同儕供養食物顯然也滿足本因素。因此，這條戒條不僅適用於在家布施者所供養的食物，也適用於寺院中比丘和沙彌所分發的食物。</td>

(Some have misread one of the “wheels” of offenses listed in the Vibhaṅga to this rule as applying to Y, but because they conflict with the offenses the Vibhaṅga to the preceding rule allots to Y for eating under a misperception, that reading cannot stand. Thus the Commentary seems right in stating that all the offenses mentioned in the Vibhaṅga to this rule apply to X.)

Whoever should take it in is to be dealt with according to the rule (i.e., this rule and the following one).” This suggests, then, that eating is technically defined as “taking into the mouth.”</td>

<tr><td>This is one of the few rules where the original instigator was an arahant: Ven. Beḷaṭṭhasīsa, Ven. Ānanda’s preceptor and formerly the head of the 1,000 ascetics who attained Awakening on hearing the Fire Sermon (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN35_28.html">SN 35:28</a>). The origin story here reports that he made a practice of keeping leftover rice from his alms round, drying it, and then moistening it to eat on a later day. As a result, he only rarely had to go out for alms. Even though he was doing this out of frugality rather than greed, the Buddha still rebuked him. The story doesn’t give the precise reasons for the rebuke. Perhaps it was because the Buddha saw that such behavior would open the way for bhikkhus to avoid going on alms round, thus depriving themselves of the excellent opportunity that alms-going provides for reflecting on their dependency on others and on the human condition in general; and depriving the laity of the benefits that come from daily contact with the bhikkhus and the opportunity to practice generosity of the most basic sort every day. Although frugality may be a virtue, there are times when other considerations supercede it.</td>
<td>這是少數最初犯戒者是阿羅漢的戒條之一：毘拉陀施沙尊者，阿難尊者的戒師，曾是聽聞《燃燒經》而覺醒的一千名苦行者的領袖（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E5%85%AB%E7%87%83%E7%87%92">《相應部》35:28經</a>）。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0115a12">這裡的起源故事報導說，他習慣將托缽剩下的米飯留著，曬乾，然後弄濕以便之後的日子吃。</a>結果，他很少出去托缽。儘管他這樣做是出於節儉而不是貪欲，但佛陀仍然訶責了他。故事沒有給出訶責的具體原因。也許是因為佛陀認為這種行為會讓比丘們逃避托缽，從而剝奪了托缽提供的反思對他人的依賴和人類普遍狀況的絕佳機會；剝奪了在家人與比丘們日常接觸所帶來的利益，以及每天實踐最基本布施的機會。雖然節儉可能是一種美德，但有時其他考慮會取代它。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Another possible reason for this rule is expressed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN5_80.html">AN 5:80</a>: “In the course of the future there will be bhikkhus who will live entangled with monastery attendants and novices. As they are entangled with monastery attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on many kinds of stored-up consumables and on making blatant signs (identifying their) land and crops.” The Buddha showed great foresight in seeing this as a danger. Over the centuries, whenever bhikkhus have lived in Communities where vast stores of food were kept—such as the great Buddhist universities in India—they have tended to grow lax in their practice, and a gulf of misunderstanding and suspicion has come to separate them from the laity.</td>
<td>這條戒條的另一個可能原因在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/05.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B">《增支部》5:80經</a>中有所闡述：「在未來，將有比丘與寺院侍者和沙彌糾纏不清。由於他們與寺院侍者和沙彌糾纏不清，可以預見，他們將熱衷於各種囤積的消耗品，並製作明顯的標誌（來表明他們的）土地和農作物。」佛陀很有遠見，體認到了這是一種危險。幾個世紀以來，每當比丘生活在儲存大量食物的僧團——例如印度的大型佛教大學——他們的修行就會變得懈怠，誤解和猜疑的鴻溝也逐漸將他們與在家人隔開。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary contains an allowance of its own, saying that, “If a bhikkhu without desire (for the food) abandons it to a novice, and the novice, having stored it (overnight) gives it (again), that is all allowable. If, however, he has received it himself and has not abandoned it, it is not proper on the second day.” This allowance raises two main questions, the first being how to interpret it. Some, focusing on the second sentence to the exclusion of the first, have noticed that it makes no mention of the presence or absence of any desire for the food, and so have interpreted it as meaning that the issue of desire is totally irrelevant: If one has not given the food to a non-bhikkhu, it is not allowable; if one has given it away, it is. This interpretation, however, ignores the point that if the presence or absence of desire for the food were irrelevant, the first sentence would not have mentioned it. Both the Old and New K/Sub-commentaries note this point, and say the <em>abandoning</em> in the second sentence means “abandoning without desire.” In other words, the Commentary’s allowance is meant to apply only in cases where one has abandoned both the food and any desire to receive it back.</td>
<td>《義註》包含一項它自己的開緣，說：「若比丘（對食物）無欲望，捨棄給沙彌，沙彌將它儲存（過夜）後（再）行給予之，則那皆允許。然而，若他自己接受而未捨棄之，則次日不宜。」這項開緣引發了兩個主要問題，第一是如何解讀它。有些人只關注第二句而忽略第一句，發現第二句並未提及對食物是否有欲望，因此將其解讀為與欲望的問題完全無關：若未將食物給予非比丘，則它是不允許的；若已將其贈與出去，則它是允許的。然而，這種解讀忽略了一點：若對食物是否有欲望無關，則第一句話就不會提及。新舊 K/《複註》均指出了這一點，並解釋第二句中的<em>捨棄</em>是「無欲望地捨棄」。換句話說，《義註》的開緣僅適用於既捨棄了食物，又捨棄了任何想要重新獲得食物的欲望的情況。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This, however, begs the second question, which is what justification the Commentary has for making the allowance. There is no basis for it in the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “stored-up,” nor is there anything else in the Vibhaṅga to this rule from which the Great Standards could be used to support the allowance. The Commentary is apparently importing one of the non-offense clauses from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP23">NP 23</a> to this rule, but that is a misapplication of the Great Standards. The Vibhaṅga for one rule cannot be used to rewrite the Vibhaṅga for another; otherwise there would be no end to the rewriting of the rules. Had the compilers meant for the principle under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP23">NP 23</a> to be applied here, they could have done so themselves. For these reasons, there seem to be no grounds for accepting the allowance as valid. Thus, if one abandons food received today then, regardless of whether one has abandoned desire for it, if one accepts it again on a later day and eats it, one commits the full offense under this rule all the same. For further analysis of this point, see the article, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/StoredUpFood.html">Stored-up Food: A Discussion of Pācittaya 38</a>.</td>
<td>但這又引出了第二個問題，就是《義註》有何依據允許這種做法。《經分別》對「儲存」的定義中沒有這種依據，《經分別》中也沒有任何其他內容可以用《四大教示》來支持這項開緣。《義註》顯然是將<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0015/#NP23">《捨墮》二三</a>中的一條不犯條款引入這條戒條中，但這是對《四大教示》的誤用。某一條戒條的《經分別》不能用來重寫另一條戒條的《經分別》，否則戒條的重寫將永無止境。如果編纂者有意將<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0015/#NP23">《捨墮》二三</a>中的原則應用於此，他們自己就可以這樣做。因此，似乎沒有理由認為接受這項開緣是有效的。因此，如果捨棄今天接受的食物，那麼無論是否已經捨棄了對該食物的欲望，如果在之後的某一天再次接受並食用，仍然會完全違犯此戒條。關於這一點的進一步分析，請參閱文章<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/StoredUpFood.html">儲存食物：《波逸提》三八的討論（英文）</a>。</td>

Thus milk and milk-mixed-with-cereal would both be finer staple foods. The ancient commentators, though, must have objected to including some of these items under the category of staple food <em>(bhojana)</em>, so we have the Commentary defining “finer staple foods” as any of the substances mentioned in the rule mixed with any one of the seven types of grain. Thus, it would say, milk with cereal would be a finer staple food, but milk on its own would not.</td>

The Sub-commentary, in discussing this point, maintains that tiger’s milk, bear’s milk, etc., are not unallowable, simply that they would not come under this rule.

If one has made a request for any of these foods but then receives the food from someone who knows nothing of the request, that food would apparently not fulfill this factor of the offense.</td>
<td>任何文獻均未提及此事，但這條戒條似乎僅指應自己請求而提供的較精緻的主食——無論是來自被請求者本人，還是來自知曉該請求的其他人。如果請求了這些食物，卻從對請求毫不知情的人那裡得到了食物，那麼這些食物顯然不滿足構成犯戒的此因素。</td>

<tr><td>Another issue not discussed in any of the texts is what to do if the people who received the request or knew of it continue to offer food of the sort requested. Is one forbidden for life from ever accepting that sort of food from them again? One suggestion for resolving this issue would be to borrow a page from the Commentary’s treatment of a revoked banishment-transaction (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg13">Sg 13</a>). This would mean that if—after the original offering of food—those who know of the request continue offering that sort of food, one must tell them that one may not accept the food because of the penalty it would entail. If, without further prompting, they say that they are offering the food not because of the request but because of their own independent desire to offer it, one may accept it and consume it.</td>
<td>另一個在任何文獻中都沒有討論的問題是，如果收到請求或知曉請求的人繼續提供所請求的該種食物，該怎麼辦？是否終身禁止再次接受他們提供的該種食物？解決這個問題的一個建議是藉用《義註》中關於撤銷驅出羯磨的處理（見<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0011/#Sg13">《僧殘》十三</a>）。這意味著，如果在最初提供食物之後，那些知曉請求的人繼續提供該種食物，必須告訴他們，由於可能帶來的懲罰，因此不能接受食物。如果他們無需進一步提示就說他們提供食物不是因為請求，而是出於他們自己的意願，那麼可以接受並食用。</td>

If these aren’t forthcoming, he should ask from his relatives or from those who have given him an invitation to ask. Or he may see what he gets on his alms round. (This last alternative apparently applies to the salt, sugar, oil, and ghee; people ordinarily would not be giving uncooked rice, beans, or green gram for alms.)

<tr><td>As mentioned above, the Commentary’s discussion of this rule includes a treatise separate from its explanation of the Vibhaṅga, dealing with controversial points for which the Canon gives unclear answers or no answers at all. Because the treatise is a compilation of the opinions of various teachers and does not pretend to explain the meaning or intent of the Buddha’s words—and because the Buddha warned bhikkhus against making up their own rules (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP15">NP 15.1.2</a>)—the opinions expressed in the treatise are not necessarily normative. Many Communities do not accept them, or are selective in choosing what they do and do not accept. Here we will give a summary of some of the Commentary’s opinions that have influenced practices found in some, if not all, Communities of bhikkhus at present.</td>
<td>如上所述，《義註》對此戒條的討論包含一篇獨立於其對《經分別》解釋的專論，該專論處理了《聖典》中未給出明確答案或根本沒有答案的爭議點。由於專論匯集了各位導師的觀點，並未假裝解釋佛陀言說的意義或意圖—因為佛陀警告比丘們不要自行制定戒條（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N01n0001_004/#0327a14">《捨墮》一五.1.2</a>）—該專論中表達的觀點並非必然具有規範性。許多僧團並不接受這些觀點，或在接受和不接受方面有所選擇性。此處我們將總結《義註》中的一些觀點，這些觀點影響了部分（即便不是全部）當今比丘僧團的修行。</td>

<tr><td>is defined as going down the throat. As we have already noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc37">Pc 37</a>, though, this definition has no justification in canonical usage. The Sub-commentary attempts to justify the Commentary’s stand here by defining “mouth” (<em>mukhadvāra</em>—literally, the door of the face) as the larynx, i.e., the back door rather than the front door to the mouth, but again this is not supported by the Canon. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0026.html#Sk41">Sk 41</a>—“I will not open the door of the face when the mouthful has yet to be brought to it”—shows decisively that this term refers to the lips and not to the larynx. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN140.html">MN 140</a> explicitly lists the mukhadvāra and the passage “whereby what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed” as two separate parts of the internal space element in the body. <em>Taking into the mouth</em> thus means taking in through the lips.</td>
<td>被定義為進入喉嚨。然而，正如我們已經在<a class="reference external" href="#Pc37">《波逸提》三七</a>中指出的，這個定義在經典用法中沒有依據。《複註》試圖透過將「嘴」（<em>mukhadvāra</em>——字面意思是臉部之門）定義為喉頭，即嘴的後門而不是前門，來證明《義註》在此的立場，但《聖典》再次不支持這種說法。<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0026.html#Sk41">《應學》四一</a>——「當一口食物尚未送達時，我不會打開臉部之門」——明確表明該術語指的是嘴唇而不是喉頭。<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/140.html">《中部》140經</a>明確列出了 mukhadvāra 和「由此吃、喝、消耗和品嚐的東西被吞嚥」這段話，它們是身體內部空間元素的兩個獨立部分。因此，<em>進入嘴中</em>意味著透過嘴唇進入。</td>

<tr><td>Pond water so muddy that it leaves a scum on the hand or on the mouth is considered to be food, and so must be given before it can be drunk. The same holds true with water into which so many leaves or flowers have fallen that their taste is discernible in the water. For some reason, though, water that has been scented with flowers need not be given, and the same is true with water taken from a stream or river no matter how muddy. (There is a belief still current in India and other parts of Asia that flowing water is inherently clean.) Although leaves and flowers technically do count as edibles—they are classed as non-staple foods or medicines, depending on one’s purpose in eating them—the idea of counting mud and scum as edibles seems to be taking the concept of edible a little too far.</td>
<td>池塘水如果太混濁，在手上或嘴上留有浮渣，則被視為食物，因此必須先被給予才能飲用。如果水中落滿了樹葉或花朵，以至於在水中可以辨別出它們的味道，也是一樣必須先被給予才能飲用。但出於某種原因，加了花香的水就不必被給予，從溪流或河流中取來的水，無論多麼渾濁，也不必被給予。（在印度和亞洲其他地區，人們至今仍然相信流動的水本身是乾淨的。）雖然從技術上講，葉子和花朵確實可以算作可食用物——它們被歸類為副食或藥物，具體取決於食用它們的目的——但將泥土和浮渣算作可食用物似乎對可食用的概念理解得有點過了。</td>

<tr><td>If toothwood is chewed for the sake of its juice, it must first be given. Even if one is chewing it for the sake of cleaning the teeth but accidentally swallows the juice, one has committed an offense all the same. These two opinions have no basis in the Canon, inasmuch as intention is not a factor in determining the offense under this rule.</td>
<td>如果為了汁液而咀嚼齒木，必須先被給予。即使是為了清潔牙齒而咀嚼，卻不小心吞下了汁液，也同樣犯了戒。這兩種觀點在《聖典》中都沒有依據，因為根據這條戒條，意圖並非判斷罪行的因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>A long section of this treatise discusses what to do if things that are not given get into food that has been given. It concludes that they must be removed from the food or the food must be given again. If the items “not given” are edibles, this seems reasonable enough, but the Commentary extends the concept to include such things as dust, dirty rain water, rust from a knife, beads of sweat dropping from one’s brow, etc. Again, this seems to be taking the concept too far, for the Vibhaṅga states clearly that the rule covers only those things generally considered as fit to eat.</td>
<td>這篇專論用了很長的篇幅討論瞭如果未給予的東西進入已給予的食物中該怎麼辦。結論是，必須將這些未給予的東西從食物中移除，或者食物必須重新被給予。如果「未給予」的東西是可食用的，這似乎很合理，但《義註》將這一概念擴展至包括灰塵、髒雨水、刀上的鏽跡、額頭上滴下的汗珠等等。同樣，這似乎將這一概念延伸得太遠了，因為《經分別》明確指出，這條戒條只涵蓋那些通常被認為適合食用的東西。</td>

<tr><td><em>Factor (a)</em> was included apparently to discourage the practice, still found in many places, of getting two or more men to present a table of food to a bhikkhu by lifting the entire table at once. The inclusion of this factor, though, has given rise to the assumption that the donor must lift the food a certain distance before handing it to the bhikkhu, but the Commentary itself shows that this assumption is mistaken, for it states that if a small novice too weak to lift a pot of rice simply slides it along the table or floor onto a bhikkhu’s hand, it is properly given.</td>
<td><em>因素（a）</em>被納入顯然是為了阻止許多地方仍然存在的這種做法：讓兩個或兩個以上的人同時抬起整張桌子，將一桌食物呈給比丘。然而，納入這一因素導致了一種假設，即布施者必須將食物抬起一定距離才能遞給比丘。但《義註》本身表明，這種假設是錯誤的，因為它指出，如果一個體弱的沙彌，無法抬起一鍋米飯，只需將米飯沿著桌子或地板滑到比丘的手中，就屬於適當地被給予。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Factor (b):</em> If any part of the donor’s body (except for his/her extended arm) is within 1.25 meters of any part of the bhikkhu’s body (except for his extended arm), this factor is fulfilled. If the donor is standing beyond reach, the bhikkhu should tell him/her to come within reach before donating the food. If for some reason the donor does not comply with the bhikkhu’s request, the bhikkhu may still accept the food but should then take it to another unordained person—without setting it down and picking it up again in the meantime (see below)—and have it properly “given” before eating it.</td>
<td><em>因素（b）：</em>如果布施者身體的任何部位（除伸出的手臂外）距離比丘身體的任何部位（除伸出的手臂外）在1.25公尺以內，則滿足此條件。若布施者站在比丘不可及的地方，比丘應告知其在布施食物前走到比丘可及的地方。若布施者因故未遵從比丘的請求，比丘仍可接受食物，但應將其帶給另一位未受具足戒者—在此期間沒有放下再拿起（見下文）—並在食用前令其適當地「被給予」。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the donor must be within reach, the food itself need not be. Thus if the donor places many vessels on a mat while the bhikkhu touches the mat with the intention of receiving them, all of the food is considered to be properly received as long as the donor is within reach of the bhikkhu. The same holds true if the donor places many vessels touching one another while the bhikkhu touches one of the vessels with the intention of receiving them all. (The factor of the bhikkhu’s intention is discussed further under factor (e) below.)</td>
<td>雖然布施者必須在可及的範圍內，但食物本身卻不必如此。因此，如果布施者將許多器皿放在墊子上，而比丘觸摸墊子意圖接受它們，只要布施者在比丘可及的範圍內，所有食物都被視為已適當地被接受。如果布施者將許多器皿彼此接觸，而比丘觸摸其中一個器皿意圖接受所有食物，則同樣適用。（比丘的意圖因素將在下文的因素（e）中進一步討論。）</td>
