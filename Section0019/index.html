<tr><td><strong>Four: The Food Chapter</strong></td>
<td><strong>第四 食物品</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: <em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em> (consumables) and <em>khādaniya</em> (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term <em>staple</em> here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.</td>
<td>本章中的許多戒條將食物分為兩類：<em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em>（噉食）和<em>khādaniya</em>（嚼食）。學者通常將兩者翻譯為「較軟的食物」和「較硬的食物」，儘管特定食物的軟硬程度與其所屬類別關係不大。更貼近每個類別本質的翻譯是「主食」和「副食」。兩者之間的差異至關重要，因為它往往是決定什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒的因素。但請注意，此處的「<em>主食</em>」一詞僅涵蓋佛陀時代被認為是主食的食物。麵包、義大利麵和馬鈴薯在西方是主食，但在當時的印度並非一直都是主食，因此並不總是屬於這一類別。</td>

<em>1) Cooked grains:</em> The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc35">Pc 35</a> defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are <em>sāḷi</em> (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); <em>vīhi</em> (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); <em>yava</em> (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); <em>godhūma</em> (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); <em>kaṅgu</em> (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); <em>varaka</em> (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and <em>kudrūsaka</em> (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.</div>

<em>2) Kummāsa:</em> The Commentary describes this as a staple confection made out of <em>yava</em> but doesn’t give any further details aside from saying that if the <em>kummāsa</em> is made out of any of the other grains or mung beans, it doesn’t count as a staple food. References to <em>kummāsa</em> in the Canon show that it was a very common staple that could form a rudimentary meal in and of itself and would spoil if left overnight.</div>

To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkaṭa. Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive (“People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting’”) or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion’s flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there, instead of criticizing or complaining, attacked them).</td>
<td>《大品》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9-15</a>）禁食十種肉：人肉、象肉、馬肉、狗肉、蛇肉、獅肉、虎肉、豹肉、熊肉和鬣狗肉。食用人肉犯《偷蘭遮》；食用任何其他不被允許食用的肉則犯《突吉羅》。人肉、馬肉和象肉被認為過於尊貴，不宜食用。其他肉類被禁止食用，要麼是因為它們令人討厭（「人們批評、抱怨並四處傳播：『這些沙門釋迦子怎麼能吃狗肉？狗令人厭惡，令人作嘔』」），要麼是因為它們危險（比丘們，聞起來有獅子肉的味道，進入叢林；那裡的獅子沒有批評或抱怨，而攻擊了他們）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds three comments here: (a) These prohibitions cover not only the meat of these animals but also their blood, bones, skin, and hide (the layer of tissue just under the skin—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_113.html">AN 4:113</a>). (b) The prohibition against dog flesh does not include wild dogs, such as wolves and foxes, (but many teachers—including the Thai translator of the Commentary—question this point). The flesh of a half-dog half-wolf mixture, however, would be forbidden. (c) The prohibition against snake flesh covers the flesh of all long, footless beings. Thus eels would not be allowed. (Many Communities question this last point as well.)</td>
<td>《義註》在此補充了三點評論： (a) 這些禁令不僅涵蓋這些動物的肉，還涵蓋它們的血、骨、皮和獸皮（皮下組織層－參見<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/04.html#%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%89%E9%A6%AC%E5%88%BA">《增支部》4:113經</a>）。 (b) 禁止食用狗肉的規定並不包括狼和狐狸等野狗（但許多導師——包括《義註》的泰文譯者——對此表示質疑）。然而，半狗半狼混血的肉是被禁止的。 (c) 禁止食用蛇肉的規定涵蓋所有長而無足的生物的肉。因此，鰻魚是不允許的。（許多僧團也對最後一點表示質疑。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.23.9">Mv.VI.23.9</a> also states that if a bhikkhu is uncertain as to the identity of any meat presented to him, he incurs a dukkaṭa if he doesn’t ask the donor what it is before eating it. The Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, on reflection, one recognizes what kind of meat it is, one needn’t ask the donor about the identity of the meat. If one doesn’t recognize it, one <em>must</em> ask. If one mistakenly identifies an unallowable sort of meat as allowable and then goes ahead and consumes it under that mistaken assumption, there is no offense.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9</a> 也規定，如果比丘不確定提供給自己的肉是什麼，並且在食用前沒有詢問施主，犯《突吉羅》。《義註》對此的解釋是，如果經過深思熟慮後，認出了是什麼肉，就無需詢問施主是什麼肉。如果認不出，就<em>必須</em>詢問。如果比丘錯誤地將不允許的肉認定為可允許的肉，並基於這種錯誤的認知繼續食用，則不構成犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>Raw flesh and blood are allowed at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.10.2">Mv.VI.10.2</a> only when one is possessed by non-human beings. Thus, in more ordinary circumstances, one may not eat raw fish or meat even if of an allowable kind. This would include such things as steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, raw eggs, and caviar. Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.31.14">Mv.VI.31.14</a>).</td>

Any of these items ordinarily used as medicines, though, would not be classed as a non-staple food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc37">《波逸提》三七</a>的《義註》將以下物品列為副食：麵粉和麵粉製成的甜點（不含雞蛋的蛋糕、麵包和義大利麵也歸入此類）；此外，根、塊莖（包括馬鈴薯）、蓮藕、芽、莖、樹皮、葉子、花、果實、堅果、種子粉、種子以及製成食物的樹脂。然而，任何這些通常用作藥物之物均不屬於副食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also acknowledges that some societies use roots, tubers, confections made out of flour, etc., as staple foods, but it nowhere suggests that the definition of staple food be altered to fit the society in which one is living. However—because eggs come under meat—any bread, pastries, noodles, and pasta made with eggs are staple foods. Thus in the West we are left with a somewhat zigzag line separating what are and are not staple foods for the purposes of the rules: Meal pounded from grain is a staple; flour ground from grain is not. Bread made with oat meal, corn meal, wheat germ, etc., would thus be a staple; bread made without any grain meal or eggs would not. The same holds true for pastries, noodles, and pasta.</td>
<td>《義註》也承認有些社會使用根莖類植物、麵粉製成的甜點等作為主食，但並未暗示應根據個人所處的社會環境改變主食的定義。然而，由於雞蛋屬於肉類，任何用雞蛋製成的麵包、糕點、麵條和義大利麵都屬於主食。因此，在西方，就戒條而言，主食和副食的劃分存在一條略顯曲折的界線：穀物搗碎的粗糧是主食；穀物磨成的麵粉則不是。因此，用燕麥粉、玉米粉、小麥胚芽等製成的麵包是主食；不含穀物粉或雞蛋的麵包則不是主食。糕點、麵條和義大利麵也是如此。</td>

<tr><td>In discussing the Great Standards, the Commentary says that grain is a “great fruit,” and thus the juice of any one of nine large fruits—palmyra fruit, coconut, jackfruit, breadfruit, bottle gourd, white gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, and squash—would fall under the same class as the juice of grain: i.e., as a non-staple food and not a juice drink. From this judgment, many Communities infer that the juice of <em>any</em> large fruit, such as pineapple or grapefruit, would also be classed as a non-staple food. However, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point, as the allowance for juice-drinks states specifically that the juice of all fruits is allowed except for that of grain.</td>
<td>在討論《四大教示》時，《義註》指出穀物是一種「大水果」，因此九種大型水果——棕櫚果、椰子、菠蘿蜜、麵包果、葫蘆、冬瓜、甜瓜、西瓜和南瓜——的任何一種果汁都與穀物汁液屬於同一類別：即歸類為副食而非果汁飲料。基於這個判斷，許多僧團推論，<em>任何</em>大型水果的果汁，例如鳳梨或柚子，也應歸類為副食。然而，並非所有僧團都認同《義註》的這一觀點，因為果汁飲料的開緣明確規定，除穀物汁液外，所有水果的果汁均允許。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, allowable leaf-juice drinks include juice squeezed from leaves that are considered food—such as lettuce, spinach, or beet greens—as well as from leaves that are classed as medicines. Health drinks such as wheat grass juice would thus be allowable. Leaf-juice may be mixed with cold water and/or warmed in the sunlight. The prohibition against consuming the juice from cooked vegetables in the afternoon covers all cooked leaves that are considered food, as well as any medicinal leaves cooked in liquids that are classed as food, such as milk. Medicinal leaves cooked in pure water retain their classification as lifetime medicines.</td>
<td>根據《義註》，允許的葉汁飲料包括從被視為食物的葉子（例如生菜、菠菜或甜菜葉）以及被歸類為藥物的葉子榨出的汁。因此，例如小麥草汁等健康飲品是允許的。葉汁可以用冷水混合和/或在陽光下加熱。禁止在下午飲用煮熟的蔬菜汁的規定涵蓋所有被視為食物的煮熟葉子，以及任何在被歸類為食物的液體（例如牛奶）中煮熟的藥用葉子。用純水煮熟的藥用葉子仍保留其終身藥物的分類。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s discussion of flower juice drinks allowable and unallowable for the afternoon shows that licorice flower juice was used to make alcohol, which is why the Canon doesn’t include it as allowable in this class. The Commentary extends this prohibition to cover any kind of flower juice prepared in such a way that it will become alcoholic. The Commentary goes on to say, though, that licorice flower juice and other flower juices <em>not</em> prepared so that they will become toddy are allowable in the morning.</td>
<td>《義註》討論了下午允許和不允許的花汁飲料，顯示甘草花汁曾被用來釀酒，因此《聖典》並未將其列入允許的此類飲品。《義註》將這項禁令擴展至涵蓋任何經過調製後會變成酒精的花汁。不過，《義註》繼續指出，甘草花汁和其他<em>未</em>經調製成棕櫚酒的花汁在早上是允許的。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes further that if a bhikkhu himself makes any of the juice drinks, he may consume it only before noon. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered before noon, one may “also” drink it with food before noon—the “also” here implying that the original allowance, that one may drink it without food after noon and before dawnrise, still holds. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered after noon, one may drink it without food until the following dawnrise. The allowance for mango juice drink covers juice made either from ripe or from unripe mangoes. To make unripe mango juice, it recommends that the mango be cut or broken into small pieces, placed in water, heated in sunlight, and then strained, adding honey, sugar, and/or camphor as desired. Juice made from <em>Bassia pierrei</em> must be diluted with water, as the undiluted juice of this fruit is too thick.</td>
<td>《義註》進一步指出，如果比丘自己做任何果汁飲料，他只能在中午前飲用。如果果汁是由非比丘製作並在中午之前正式地供養，則比丘「也」可以在中午之前與食物一起飲用——這裡的「也」意味著原來的開緣仍然有效，即可以在中午之後和黎明之前不帶食物地飲用。如果果汁是由非比丘製作並在中午之後正式地供養，則比丘可以在第二天黎明之前不帶食物地飲用。芒果汁飲料的允許範圍涵蓋成熟或未成熟芒果製成的果汁。要製作未成熟芒果汁，建議將芒果切成或掰成小塊，放入水中，在陽光下加熱，然後過濾，並根據需要添加蜂蜜、糖和/或樟腦。用<em>芒果椴樹（Bassia pierrei）</em>製成的果汁必須用水稀釋，因為這種水果的未稀釋果汁太濃稠。</td>

Thus, it says, if fruit juice has a whole, unhusked coconut floating in it, the coconut may be removed, and the juice is all right to drink until the following dawnrise. If butter is placed on top of rice porridge, the part of the butter that hasn’t melted into the rice may be kept and eaten for seven days.

<tr><td>Translated in this way, the passage covers foods that are already mixed when presented to a bhikkhu. One of the general issues that led to the convening of the Second Council, however, concerned how to treat cases where foods received separately are then mixed by a bhikkhu. The specific issue presented to the Council was that of bhikkhus who kept a horn filled with salt so that they could add salt to bland foods. The Council’s verdict was that in doing so, the bhikkhus incurred a pācittiya under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>. The Vibhaṅga to that rule, however, gives a dukkaṭa for using, as food, life-long medicine that has been stored overnight, and salt is a life-long medicine. Thus the elders at the Council seem to have reasoned that if the salt has been mixed in with food, the mixture as a whole counts as food accepted when the first ingredient (the salt) was accepted: thus the pācittiya, rather than the dukkaṭa, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>.

<tr><td>The question the Commentary then raises is, “Why is the word ‘that day’ <em>(tadahu)</em> omitted from the last case?” Its answer is that there is no limit on when the medicine has to be received for it to be properly mixed with a tonic received today. In other words, it could have been received any number of days before the tonic was received. If it is mixed with the tonic on the first day of the tonic’s life span, the mixture as a whole has a seven-day life span. If mixed with the tonic on the second day of the tonic’s life, the mixture has a six-day life span, and so forth. The Commentary’s translation of this passage may strain standard Pali syntax, but it is grammatically correct and is the only way of deriving from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.40.3">Mv.VI.40.3</a> a general principle to cover the issue of foods received separately that are then mixed by a bhikkhu. Thus the principle has been generally accepted that tonics and medicines, such as sugar and salt, received today may be eaten mixed with food or juice drinks received today, but not with food or juice drinks received on a later day. Medicine, such as salt, tea, or cocoa, received at any time may be eaten mixed with any of the five tonics on any day of the tonic’s life span.</td>
<td>《義註》接下來提出的問題是：「為什麼在最後一種情況下省略了『當天』<em>（tadahu）</em>這個詞？」答案是，沒有限制何時接受藥物以便將其與今天接受的補品適當地混合。換句話說，它可以是在接受補品之前的任何天接受的。如果它在補品的有效期的第一天與補品混合，則混合物作為一個整體擁有七天的有效期。如果在補品有效期的第二天與補品混合，則混合物擁有六天的有效期，依此類推。《義註》對這段話的翻譯可能不符合標準巴利句法，但在語法上是正確的，並且是從<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a> 中得出涵蓋比丘分開接受然後混合食物問題的一般原則的唯一方法。因此，普遍接受的原則是：今天接受的補品和藥物（例如糖和鹽）可以與今天收到的食物或果汁飲料混合食用，但不能與之後的日期裡接受的食物或果汁飲料混合食用。任何時間接受的藥物（例如鹽、茶或可可）都可以與五種補品中的任何一種在補品有效期內的任何一天混合食用。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s conclusion, though, creates a problem when lay people want to invite Communities of more than three bhikkhus to their homes for a meal. Perhaps this problem is what induced the Commentary to interpret the Vibhaṅga’s definition of a <em>group meal</em> as meaning one in which the invitations specifically mention the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em>, or the type of meal or food to be served. (“Come to my house for breakfast tomorrow.” “I know you don’t often get a chance to eat Indian food, so I’m inviting you all over for chappatties and curry.”) This interpretation has led to the custom of phrasing invitations to eat “in the morning” or to eat “before noon,” so that groups of four or more bhikkhus may be invited without breaking this rule.</td>
<td>然而，《義註》的結論卻帶來了一個問題：當在家眾想邀請超過三位比丘的僧團到家中用餐時，就會出現問題。或許正是這個問題促使《義註》將《經分別》對「<em>結眾食</em>」的定義解讀為，邀請中明確提到「<em>餐</em>」或「<em>食物</em>」一詞，或具體提供餐食或食物種類。（「明天來我家吃早餐。」「我知道你們不常有機會吃印度菜，所以我邀請你們全部來吃印度薄餅和咖哩。」）這種解讀導致了邀請措辭中出現「早上」吃或「中午之前」吃的習慣，這樣，邀請四位或四位以上的比丘團體也不會違反這條戒條。</td>

<tr><td>The Buddha’s purposes for establishing this rule, though, are listed at Cv.VII.3.13 as follows: “For the restraint of evil-minded individuals, for the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, so that those with evil desires will not split the Community by (forming) a faction, and out of compassion for families.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of <em>group meal</em> accomplishes none of these purposes: The custom of phrasing invitations to avoid the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em> does nothing to restrain evil-minded individuals, etc., and it actually creates trouble for lay people who do not know the custom, a point well-illustrated by the Commentary itself in an entertaining section on how to deal with a person whose invitation contains the word <em>meal</em>. After getting the run-around from the meal designator—who apparently was not allowed to tell him in any straightforward way how to phrase his invitation and so gave him a long series of hints—the poor man returns to his friends and makes a cryptic statement that the A/Sub-commentary translates as: “There are a lot of words that have to be spoken in this business of making an invitation.

<tr><td>To find an alternative to the Commentary’s explanation, we have to go back to the origin stories leading to the reformulations of the rule, where we find an interesting point: The invitations rejected by scrupulous bhikkhus on the grounds that they would break the rule all deal with “invitational” meals. In one of them, a naked ascetic invites a group of bhikkhus to an invitational meal and is rejected on the grounds that it would constitute a group meal. He then goes to the Buddha and—after complaining that he should not be subjected to such treatment—rephrases the invitation, this time inviting the entire Community. This suggests that he felt an invitation of this sort would not constitute a group meal.</td>
<td>為了找到與《義註》不同的解釋，我們必須追溯導致戒條被重新制定的起源故事，在那裡我們發現了一個有趣的點：那些被嚴謹的比丘們以違反戒戒為由拒絕的邀請，都與「邀請」食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「別請食」]</span>有關。其中一則故事中，一位裸體苦行僧<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「裸形外道」]</span>邀請一群比丘參加邀請食，卻被拒絕，理由是這會構成結眾食。他隨後來到佛陀面前，在抱怨自己不應遭受這種待遇之後，重新措辭了邀請，這次邀請的是整個僧團。這表明，他認為這種邀請不構成結眾食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>His reasoning has its grounds in the Vinaya itself: Throughout the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas, the word <em>group</em> is used to refer to any set of bhikkhus not forming a complete Community and yet acting as an independent unit. This may be why the category of Community meal was not mentioned in the non-offense clauses: The arrangers of the Vibhaṅga may have felt that no mention was necessary, in that the term <em>group</em> meal automatically excluded Community meals.</td>
<td>他的推論在戒律中自有其依據：在《經分別》和《犍度》中，「<em>結眾</em>」一詞被用來指任何未組成完整僧團，但仍作為獨立單位行動的比丘群體。這或許就是為什麼在不犯條款中沒有提及僧團食這個類別的原因：《經分別》的編纂者可能認為沒有必要提及，因為「<em>結眾</em>」一詞自動排除了僧團食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Similar considerations suggest that designated meals may also be exempted from this rule even though they are not mentioned in the non-offense clauses. Invitations to such meals were customarily worded as requests for so-and-so many bhikkhus “from the Community,” and thus—as a type of Community meal—they would by definition not be invitations to a “group” meal.</td>
<td>類似的考慮表明，即使不犯條款中未提及指定食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「僧次請食」]</span>，也可不受此戒條約束。此類餐食的邀請習慣措詞為「來自僧團」的某某多少比丘的請求，因此，作為一種僧團食，它們從定義上來說並非「結眾」食的邀請。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because invitations to lottery meals and periodic meals did not customarily make reference to the Community, the Vibhaṅga arrangers did have to make mention of those types of meals in order to exempt them.</td>
<td>由於抽籤食<span class="is-size-7">[譯註：古漢譯為「行籌食」]</span>和週期食的邀請通常不會提及僧團，因此《經分別》的編纂者必須提及這些類型的餐食才能免除它們。</td>

<td><em>我們剩下的戒條只適用於對四名或四名以上比丘的特定群體（而非僧團）的邀請，無論邀請中是否提到「食物」或「餐」一詞。</em></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form has the virtue of fulfilling the express purposes mentioned for it in Cv.VII.3.13: It would prevent evil-minded bhikkhus and lay people from trying to exert influence over specific groups in the Community by arranging meals especially for them; and in the same way, it would prevent people with evil desires from creating a split in the Community. (Because the smallest faction that can create a split in the Community is four bhikkhus, the maximum number allowed at a group meal is three.)</td>
<td>這種形式的戒條，其優點在於能夠實現<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_017#0268a04">《小品》.七.3.13</a> 中明確提及的目的：它可以防止心懷惡欲的比丘和在家眾，試圖透過專門為僧團中的特定群體安排餐食來對他們施加影響；同樣，它也可以防止心懷惡欲的人在僧團中製造分裂。（由於能夠造成僧團分裂的最小派系是四位比丘，因此結眾食允許的最大人數是三人。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form would also contribute to the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus in that invitations to meals would not be preempted by factions; and it would protect lay families from being prey to the maneuverings of bhikkhus who would pressure them repeatedly into providing meals as part of their strategy to create and maintain such factions. (Anyone who has lived in a traditional Buddhist country knows only too well the influence of sweet-talking bhikkhus over unsuspecting or low-minded lay people. This sort of thing neither started nor ended with Devadatta.)</td>
<td>這種形式的戒條也能讓品行端正的比丘們感到樂住，因為用餐邀請不會被派系搶先；它還能保護在家人免受比丘們的計謀的侵害。比丘們會反覆施壓，要求他們提供餐食，以此作為製造和維持派系的策略之一。（任何在傳統佛教國家生活過的人都深知甜言蜜語的比丘們對毫無戒心或心境低下的在家人的影響。提婆達多既不是這種事的開端，也不是終結。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because Community meals and designated meals would not form an opening for such machinations, there would be no reason to limit them to groups of three if lay people want to invite groups larger than that. One objection to exempting Community meals from this rule is that a meal for the entire Community would be more burdensome than a meal for a smaller group, but that is what designated meals are for. A donor willing and able to provide a meal for an entire Community is welcome but not required to do so. A donor willing but not able may simply ask to provide a meal for x-number of bhikkhus from the Community, leaving it up to the meal designator to designate which bhikkhus will go for the meal, with no danger of creating a faction.</td>
<td>因為僧團食和指定食不會為此類陰謀提供機會，所以如果在家眾想邀請比三人更多的團體，沒有理由將其限制在三人以內。有人反對將僧團食排除在這條戒條之外，因為為整個僧團提供一餐比為一小群人提供一餐更有負擔，但指定食就是為了滿足這一需求。願意且有能力為整個僧團供餐的布施者歡迎但不強制要求這樣做。願意但無力提供的布施者可以直接要求為僧團中的x位比丘供餐，由餐食指定者指定哪些比丘來享用這餐，這樣就不會有分裂的危險。</td>

<tr><td><em>Thus the point at issue is not whether the invitation makes mention of food or meals, but whether it specifies the individual bhikkhus to be invited.</em> If it specifies more than three individual bhikkhus—either naming them outright or saying such things as “Ven.

<td><em>因此，問題的關鍵不在於邀請中是否提及食物或餐，而在於是否指定受邀的比丘。</em>如果邀請指定三位以上的比丘——無論是直接點名，還是諸如「X尊者和他的四位朋友」或「你們五位」之類的說法——那麼這餐就算是結眾食。</td>
