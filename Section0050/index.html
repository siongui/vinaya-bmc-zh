<tr><td>Well before the Buddha’s time there was a custom in India that wanderers would stay in place for the rainy season, both to avoid having to negotiate muddy roads and to avoid trampling plants. Bhikkhus in the early years of the Buddha’s teaching career were criticized by the Jains for not observing this custom, so the Buddha gave his permission for them to stop their wandering for three months of the Rains. Later he imposed a penalty for not observing this custom.</td>
<td>早在佛陀時代之前，印度就有一個習俗，就是遊方者會在雨季待在原地，以避免行走泥濘的道路和踩踏植物。在佛陀早期的教化生涯中，比丘們因不遵守這項習俗而受到耆那教徒的批評，於是佛陀允許他們在雨季三個月內停止遊方。後來，他對不遵守這項習俗施加懲罰。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>Because the rainy season in South Asia is roughly four months, bhikkhus are allowed to choose between two periods of Rains-residence: the first, starting the day after the full moon of the month of Asāḷhi (roughly July); and the second, starting the day after the following full moon. At present, the first Rains-residence starts on the full moon in July, or the second if there are two. Why the Buddha formulated two periods of Rains-residence, the Canon does not say. From the Commentary’s discussion of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.II.21.4">Mv.II.21.4</a>, it would appear that if one enters the first Rains and then, for one reason or another, “breaks” the Rains (see below) within the first month, one would still be eligible to enter the second Rains so as to receive the privileges contingent on its successful completion.</td>
<td>由於南亞的雨季大約有四個月，比丘們可以在兩個雨安居時段之間進行選擇：前雨安居，從 Asāḷhi 月（大約是七月）滿月的次日開始；後雨安居，從下一個滿月的次日開始。目前，前雨安居從七月的滿月開始，如果有兩個滿月，則從第二個開始。至於佛陀為何要訂定兩個雨安居時段，《聖典》中並未說明。從《義註》對<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0158a11">《大品》.二.21.4</a> 的討論來看，如果入前雨安居，然後因為某種原因在第一個月內「中斷」了雨安居（見下文），仍然有資格入後雨安居，並在圓滿完成之後獲得方便利益。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the Buddha’s time, the determination of the lunar calendar was one of the responsibilities of the government in each kingdom or republic. Thus, to avoid controversy, the Buddha allowed that the wishes of kings be respected in this matter: If a king wanted to postpone the designation of the Asāḷhi full moon another month, bhikkhus were allowed to comply. (The rule coming from this origin story is stated in more general terms—“I allow that kings be complied with”—showing the general principle that we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0046.html#BMC2chapter7">Chapter 7</a>, that the Buddha was not so foolish as to try to legislate for kings. The Commentary notes, however, that this principle applies only in matters in which the king’s wish is in line with the Dhamma. No one, it says, should be complied with in matters where their wishes are not in line with the Dhamma.) At present, the governments of only a few countries concern themselves with calculating the lunar calendar for the sake of the general population. In other countries this point is not an issue, and the bhikkhus are free to calculate the lunar calendar without regard to the government’s calculations.</td>
<td>在佛陀時代，制定陰曆是每個王國或共和國政府的職責之一。因此，為了避免爭議，佛陀允許在此事上尊重國王的意願：如果國王想將 Asāḷhi 滿月的指定推遲一個月，比丘們被允許遵從。（源自此起源故事的戒條以更普遍的措辭表達——「我允許國王被遵從」——體現了我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0046.html#BMC2chapter7">第七章</a>中提到的普遍原則，即佛陀不會愚蠢到試圖為國王立法。然而，《義註》指出，這一原則僅適用於國王意願符合佛法的事上。它說，如果有人的意願與佛法不符，就不應該在該事上遵從他。）目前，只有少數國家的政府會為了民眾而計算陰曆。在其他國家，這一點並不成問題，比丘們可以自由地計算陰曆，而不必考慮政府的計算方式。</td>

<tr><td>The first day of the Rains-residence is when lodgings in a monastery are assigned for the duration of the Rains, so the Commentary recommends that a bhikkhu planning to spend the Rains in another monastery should start heading there a month before the start of the Rains so as not to inconvenience the assigner of lodgings and other bhikkhus there. As for bhikkhus planning to stay on in the monastery where they are already residing, they should spend the month before the beginning of the Rains preparing any worn-down buildings so that those who come for the Rains will study and/or practice meditation in comfort. The assigner of lodgings should assign lodgings for the Rains at dawn of the day the Rains begins. If other bhikkhus come later in the day and there are no extra spaces for them, they should be told that the lodgings have been assigned and that they should go to other lodgings, such as the foot of a tree. (What this means, apparently, is that they should enter the second Rains somewhere else, as the Canon contains a rule against entering the Rains in anything less than a proper dwelling. See below.)</td>
<td>雨安居的第一天是寺院分配雨安居住所的日子，因此《義註》建議，計劃在其他寺院度過雨安居的比丘應在雨安居開始前一個月前往該寺院，以免給分配住所的人和寺院的其他比丘帶來不便。至於計劃繼續留在現居寺院的比丘，他們應在雨安居開始前一個月整修任何破舊的建築，以便前來雨安居的人能夠舒適地學習和/或修行。分配住所的人應在雨安居開始當天黎明分配雨安居住所。如果其他比丘當天晚些時候到來，並且沒有多餘的空間，應告知他們住所已分配完畢，他們應前往其他住所，例如樹下。（顯然，這意味著他們應該在其他地方入後雨安居，因為《聖典》裡戒條規定，不得在非合適住所入雨安居。見下文。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.III.4.2">Mv.III.4.2</a> states that on a day for beginning the Rains one should not intentionally pass by a residence/monastery not desiring to enter for the Rains. How this applies to the beginning of the second Rains period is obvious: A bhikkhu must stop for the Rains on that day. As for the beginning of the first Rains period, the Commentary notes simply that if there are obstacles (see below), one may choose to enter the second Rains period instead. One obstacle not mentioned in the list below, however, is discussed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.II.21.4">Mv.II.21.4</a>. This is the case of a monastery where many (i.e., four or more) bhikkhus—“inexperienced and incompetent”—are staying for the Rains and none of them knows the uposatha or the uposatha transaction, the Pāṭimokkha or the recital of the Pāṭimokkha. One of them should be sent to a neighboring monastery immediately to master the Pāṭimokkha in brief or in its full extent. If he can manage it immediately, well and good. If not, one of them should be sent to a neighboring monastery for a period of seven days to master the Pāṭimokkha in brief or in its full extent. If he can manage it within seven days, well and good. If not, then all the bhikkhus should go stay for the Rains in the neighboring monastery. If they stay where they are, they all incur a dukkaṭa. None of the texts discuss the point, but apparently “going to stay for the Rains” in the neighboring monastery means entering the second Rains there.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_003#0186a13">《大品》.三.4.2</a> 規定，在雨安居開始的那一天，不應該故意路過不想入雨安居的住所/寺院。這一條如何適用於後雨安居期的開始是顯而易見的：比丘必須在那一天留下來過雨安居。至於前雨安居期的開始，《義註》僅指出，如果有障礙（見下文），可以選擇入後雨安居期。然而，有一個障礙在下面的列表中沒有提到，在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0158a11">《大品》.二.21.4</a> 中進行了討論。這種情況發生在一個寺院裡，許多（即四位或更多）比丘——「缺乏經驗和能力」——留下來過雨安居，他們中沒有人懂得布薩或布薩羯磨、《波羅提木叉》或《波羅提木叉》的念誦。應立即派遣其中一人前往鄰近的寺院，簡略或全面掌握《波羅提木叉》。如果他能立即掌握，那就很好。如果不能，應派遣其中一人前往鄰近的寺院，為期七天，簡略或全面掌握《波羅提木叉》。如果他能在七天內掌握，那就很好。如果不能，那麼所有比丘都應該前往鄰近的寺院雨安居。如果他們留在原地，全都犯《突吉羅》。所有文獻均未討論這一點，但顯然「前往鄰近的寺院雨安居」意味著在那裡入後雨安居。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds here that if a monastery has only one bhikkhu who knows the Pāṭimokkha and he dies, leaves, or disrobes in the first month of the first Rains, the remainder should go where there is someone who knows the Pāṭimokkha and stay there for the second Rains. If the knowledgeable bhikkhu dies, leaves, or disrobes in the latter two months of the first Rains, the remainder may stay there for the remainder of the Rains without offense.</td>
<td>《義註》在此補充：如果一座寺院只有一位通曉《波羅提木叉》的比丘，且此人在前雨安居期的第一個月內去世、離開或還俗，其餘比丘應前往有通曉《波羅提木叉》之人的地方，並在後雨安居期住在那裡。如果這位知識淵博的比丘在前雨安居期的後兩個月內去世、離開或還俗，其餘比丘可以在雨安居期剩餘時間裡住在那裡而不犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>However, one does not have to spend the Rains in a monastery. One may also live alone or in a small, ad hoc group as long as one stays in a proper lodging and knows the uposatha transaction appropriate for one’s number (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#BMC2chapter15">Chapter 15</a>). In general, the Commentary says that a proper lodging is one with a door that can be opened and closed. Improper lodging arrangements listed in the Canon include living in the hollow of a tree (“like goblins”), in the fork of a tree (“like hunters”), in the open air, in a non-lodging (according to the Commentary, this means a place covered with the five kinds of allowable facing/roofing but lacking a door that can be opened and closed), in a charnel house (a place for keeping corpses, says the Commentary, adding that other proper lodgings within a charnel ground are all right), under a canopy, or in a large storage vessel (the Commentary interprets this as a shield). The Commentary notes that if one fixes up a hut in the hollow of a tree or the fork of a tree with a platform, a proper roof, walls, and a door, it is all right to stay there. The same holds true with a canopy or a shield if it is fitted with walls nailed to four posts and provided with a door that can be opened and closed. Yurts would thus be allowable.</td>
<td>然而，不必在寺院裡度過雨安居。也可以獨自居住，或與臨時小群體住在一起，只要住在合適的住所，並通曉適合自己人數的布薩羯磨（見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#BMC2chapter15">第十五章</a>）。一般來說，《義註》說，適當的住所是指有可開關門的住所。《聖典》中列出的不合適的住所包括住在樹洞裡（「像妖精一樣」）、樹杈裡（「像獵人一樣」）、露天、非住所（根據《義註》，這指的是用五種允許的面/屋頂覆蓋，但沒有可開關門的地方）、屍骨存放處（《義註》說，這是存放屍體的地方，並補充說，屍骨堆內的其他適當住所都可以）、在樹冠/頂蓬下，或在一個大型儲藏船中（《義註》將其解釋為屏障）。《義註》指出，如果在樹洞或樹杈裡搭建了一間小屋，配有平台、合適的屋頂、牆壁和門，那麼住在那裡是可以的。如果樹冠/頂蓬或屏障的牆壁釘在四根柱子上，並配有可開關的門，則同樣可以居住。因此，蒙古包是允許的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Canon also gives permission to stay in a cowherd camp, with a caravan, or in a boat. If, during the Rains, any of these picks up and moves, one is allowed to go along. The Commentary adds that if one is planning to stay with a caravan, one should inform the caravan people that one needs a small hut on one of the carts. If they provide that, one may take that hut as one’s residence for the Rains. If not, one may take as one’s residence the space under a tall cart. If that is not possible, one should not enter the Rains with that caravan. If one is joining the caravan in hopes of arriving at a particular destination, then if the caravan reaches that destination one is allowed to remain there even if the caravan continues on its way. If the caravan breaks up, one should remain at the spot where it breaks up until the end of the Rains. If one has entered the Rains in a boat, then if the boat ends its trip, one should stay at that spot. If the boat is following the river bank or sea coast and arrives at one’s destination, one may stay there even if the boat continues its journey.</td>
<td>《聖典》也允許人們在牧牛營、商隊或船上居住。如果在雨安居期間，這些中的任何一個開始移動，允許跟隨之。《義註》補充道，如果打算跟著商隊居住，應該告知商隊成員，需要在一輛馬車上搭建一間小屋。如果他們提供小屋，可以把小屋當作雨安居的住所。如果沒有，可以把高大的馬車下方的空間當作住所。如果無法做到這一點，不應該跟隨商隊入雨安居。如果加入商隊是為了到達某個目的地，那麼如果商隊到達目的地，即使商隊繼續前行，也可以留在那裡。如果商隊解散，應該留在解散地點，直到雨安居結束。如果在船上入雨安居，那麼如果船結束了行程，應該留在該地點。如果船沿著河岸或海岸行駛並到達自己的目的地，即使船隻繼續航行，也可以留在那裡。</td>

<tr><td>If a bhikkhu has accepted an invitation to stay at a certain place for the Rains but then does not fulfill his promise by not staying at the place, he incurs a dukkaṭa for the broken promise and becomes ineligible for the privileges contingent on having completed that Rains-residence. (Literally, the rule says that his first Rains “isn’t discerned,” which means that it doesn’t count.) The Sub-commentary misses the point of this rule, which has led to its general misinterpretation. In the origin story, Ven. Upananda accepts an invitation to spend the Rains at one spot and then decides to spend the Rains at two other locations. The Sub-commentary maintains that his Rains was invalidated by the fact that he determined two locations for his Rains; however, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.VIII.25.4">Mv.VIII.25.4</a> shows that spending the Rains in two locations, spending half of one’s time at one and half at the other, is perfectly legitimate. Thus the only possible reason for Ven. Upananda’s first Rains not to count is because he broke his promise.</td>
<td>如果一位比丘接受了在某地安居的邀請，但後來卻沒有履行諾言，沒有住在那裡，他將因違背諾言而犯《突吉羅》，並且失去資格享受完成雨安居的方便利益。（字面意思是，這條戒條說他的前雨安居「未被辨識」，這意味著它不算數。）《複註》沒有理解這條戒條的要點，導致了它被普遍誤解。在起源故事中，優波難陀尊者接受了在一個地方雨安居的邀請，然後決定在另外兩個地方雨安居。《複註》認為，他的雨安居無效，因為他決意了兩個雨安居地點；然而，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0390a10">《大品》.八.25.4</a> 表明，在兩個地方雨安居，一半時間在一個地方，一半時間在另一個地方，是完全合法的。因此，優波難陀尊者的前雨安季不算數的唯一可能原因是他違背了諾言。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Canon also states that one also incurs the dukkaṭa for breaking one’s promise in this situation if one goes to the agreed location and then “breaks” one’s Rains (see below). The Commentary notes in either case that if one originally made the promise with the intention of breaking it, one incurs both the dukkaṭa for the broken promise and a pācittiya for lying. From the way these rules are phrased in the Canon—“one’s first (Rains) isn’t discerned”—it would appear that if one promised to stay for the first Rains but then broke the promise, one would still be eligible to stay at the promised place, or elsewhere, for the second Rains and be eligible for the lesser privileges contingent on having completed the second Rains, but none of the commentaries mention this point.</td>
<td>《聖典》也指出，如果去約定地點後「破壞」了雨安居（見下文），在這種情況下，也會因違背諾言而犯《突吉羅》。《義註》指出，無論哪種情況，如果最初許諾時有意違背，他都會因違背諾言而犯《突吉羅》，並因說謊而犯《波逸提》。從《聖典》對這些戒條的表述方式——「無法辨識前（雨安居）」——來看，如果承諾在前雨安居留下，但後來違背了諾言，他仍然有資格在後雨安居留在承諾的地方或其他地方，並有資格在完成後雨安居後享受較少的方便利益，但所有註釋書均未提及這一點。</td>

The Canon gives a long list of situations in which a person—lay or ordained—might want a bhikkhu to come for these purposes. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but it provides an interesting glimpse of the merit-making occasions of the time: The donor has arranged the construction of a building, either for the Community, for a group of bhikkhus, or a single bhikkhu; he/she has arranged the construction of a building for his/her own use. Other occasions, given only in the case of a lay follower, include the following: His/her son or daughter is getting married; he/she has fallen ill; or he/she has memorized an important discourse and wants to pass it on so that it does not disappear with his/her death (which, in the days before written transmission, could easily have happened). In all these cases, the Sub-commentary says that if one goes without being sent for, one has broken one’s Rains-residence and incurred an offense.</td>

<tr><td>Under the heading of seven-day business, the Commentary gives some extra allowances that it admits do not come from the Canon. If, before the Rains, a group of bhikkhus set a date for a meeting during the Rains—the context of the Commentary’s allowance suggests that the meeting would be to listen to a Dhamma talk—one may treat it as seven-day business, but not if one’s intention in going is simply to wash one’s belongings. However, if one’s mentor sends one there for whatever purpose (even for washing one’s robes, says the Sub-commentary) one may go for seven days. If one goes to a monastery that is not far away, intending to return that day, but for some reason cannot return in time, one may treat it as seven-day business. One may not use the seven-day allowance for recitation and interrogation—i.e., memorizing and studying the meaning of the Dhamma—yet if one goes with the purpose of visiting one’s mentor and returning that day, but the mentor tells one to stay on, it is all right to stay. The Sub-commentary adds here that one may even stay on for more than seven days without incurring an offense, although one’s Rains will be broken. Because these allowances have no basis in the Canon, many Communities do not recognize them as valid.</td>
<td>在七日事務的範疇下，《義註》給了一些額外的開緣，並承認這些開緣並非出自《聖典》。如果在雨安居之前，一群比丘約定了在雨安居期間一個聚會的日期——《義註》的開緣上下文暗示這次聚會是為了聆聽佛法開示——可以將其視為七日事務，但如果比丘前往的目的僅僅是清洗自己的物品，則不可以。然而，如果自己的導師派自己去那裡，無論出於何種目的（《複註》說，即使是為了洗自己的袈裟），可以去七天。如果前往一座不遠的寺院，打算當天返回，但由於某種原因無法及時返回，也可以將其視為七日事務。七天的開緣不得用於背誦及詢問—即背誦和研習佛法的意義。但如果是為了拜訪自己的導師而去，並在當天返回，但導師告訴自己繼續留下，則也可以留下。《複註》補充道，即使停留超過七天也不構成犯戒，雖然會破雨安居。由於這些開緣在《聖典》中沒有依據，許多僧團並不承認其有效性。</td>

<tr><td>Traditionally, the Rains-residence is a time for becoming more stringent in one’s practice. Often, bhikkhus staying together will make group vows as a way of offering encouragement to one another. However, there is a rule against making agreements that are not in accord with the Dhamma. In the origin story for this rule, a group of bhikkhus agreed not to ordain any new bhikkhus during the Rains. A relative of Lady Visākhā wanted to ordain during that period but the bhikkhus refused, telling him to wait to the end of the Rains. Yet when the Rains had ended, he had abandoned his desire to ordain. So the Buddha made a ruling that “This sort of agreement should not be made: ‘During the Rains, the Going-forth is not to be given.’”</td>

In the origin story to that rule, the Buddha learns that a group of bhikkhus have observed a vow of silence for the duration of the Rains and his response is this: “These worthless men, having spent the Rains uncomfortably, claim to have spent the Rains comfortably. Having spent the Rains in cattle (-like) affiliation, they claim to have spent the Rains comfortably.

<tr><td>The Commentary to Pārājika 4 expands on this point with a long list of agreements that should not be made for the Rains: refusing to give the Going-forth, prohibiting the study or teaching of the Dhamma, deciding to share in-season gifts to the Community with bhikkhus staying outside the monastery precincts, or compelling the observance of the dhutaṅga (ascetic) practices. The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#Cv.VI.11.3">Cv.VI.11.3</a> adds other agreements to this list: refusing to give Acceptance, refusing to give dependence, refusing to give the opportunity to listen to the Dhamma, and not sharing Community gains with those who go away on seven-day business. It then adds a list of agreements that <em>would</em> accord with the Dhamma, such as encouraging one another to know moderation in speech, to converse on the ten proper subjects of conversation (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_69.html">AN 10:69</a>), to show consideration to meditators when one is reciting the Dhamma, to willingly undertake any of the dhutaṅga practices in line with one’s abilities, and to be heedful at all times.</td>
<td>《波羅夷》四的《義註》擴充此點，列舉了一長串雨安居不應達成的約定：拒絕給予出家，禁止研習或教授佛法，決定與待在寺院區域外的比丘分享當季的布施，或強迫遵循頭陀行（苦行）。<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_016#0226a07">《小品》.六.11.3</a> 的《義註》增加了其他約定到此列表上：拒絕授予具足戒，拒絕給予依止，拒絕給予聽聞佛法的機會，以及不與外出處理七日事務的人分享僧團的收益。然後，它又增加了一系列<em>會</em>符合佛法的約定，例如鼓勵彼此懂得言語適度、談論十種適當的話題（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/zcj/zengzhi/content/1601.html">《增支部》10:69經</a>）、在誦讀佛法時體諒禪修者、願意根據自己的能力進行任何頭陀行、以及時刻保持不放逸。</td>

<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#Mv.VIII.32">Mv.VIII.32</a> lists eight ways in which a donor may designate gifts of cloth, and one of them is that a gift of cloth may be for the bhikkhus who are residing or have resided in a particular residence for the Rains. We will discuss this arrangement in more detail in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">Chapter 18</a>, but here we will simply note the Commentary’s observation that, during the Rains-residence, this arrangement applies only to bhikkhus who have kept the residence up to that point without break; for one month after the Rains, it applies only to the bhikkhus who have successfully kept the entire Rains-residence. According to the Canon, if the kaṭhina has been spread, this arrangement extends until the end of the kaṭhina privileges.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0400a03">《大品》.八.32</a> 列出了布施者指定贈布的八種方式，其中之一就是布匹可以贈予正在或曾經在特定住處居住過雨安居的比丘。我們將在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">第十八章</a>詳細討論這項安排，但這裡我們僅提及《義註》中的觀察：在雨安居期間，此安排僅適用於保持安居不破的比丘；雨安居過後一個月，此安排僅適用於成功保持整個雨安居的比丘。根據《聖典》，如果功德衣已經敷展，此安排將持續到功德衣方便利益結束為止。</td>

<tr><td>The Canon also adds that, if a donor has designated a gift of cloth for the bhikkhus who are residing/have resided for the Rains, a bhikkhu who is not residing/has not resided for the Rains in that residence should not accept a portion. To do so is to incur a dukkaṭa. The Commentary adds that if he does accept such a portion, he should return it. If it gets worn out or lost before he returns it, he should make compensation. If, when the Community asks for its return, he doesn’t return it, the offense is to be determined by the value of the cloth, which could well amount to a pārājika. In saying this, the Commentary is following the theory of bhaṇḍadeyya, which—as we stated in the discussion of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>—has no basis in the Canon. Here in particular it seems excessive punishment for what the Canon explicitly says is an act incurring only a dukkaṭa. If we follow the Canon, the bhikkhu who has accepted such a portion need not return it. Once it has been given to him, it is his—even though he incurs an offense in accepting it.</td>
<td>《聖典》也補充道，如果布施者指定為正在/已在度雨安居的比丘布施布料，則未正在/未曾在該住處度雨安居的比丘不應接受部分布料。這樣做會犯《突吉羅》。《義註》補充道，如果他接受了這部分布料，則應歸還。如果在歸還之前布料磨損或遺失，則應予以賠償。如果當僧團要求歸還布料時，他沒有歸還，則應根據布料的價值來判定其罪過，這很可能構成《波羅夷》罪（pārājika）。《義註》這樣說是遵循了「bhaṇḍadeyya」的理論，正如我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr2">《波羅夷》二</a>的討論中所述，這種理論在《聖典》中沒有依據。尤其在這裡，對於《聖典》明確指出只會犯《突吉羅》的行為，懲罰似乎過重。如果我們遵循《聖典》，接受這部分布料的比丘無需歸還。一旦被給予，這部分布料就屬於他了——即使他接受它時犯了戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As mentioned above, under the topic of seven-day business, there is the technical possibility that a bhikkhu may enter the Rains in two residences. If donors at both places designate gifts of Rains-residence cloth, then if the bhikkhu spends half the time at one residence and half the time at the other, he should be given half a portion here and half a portion there. Or if he spends more time at one than the other, he should be given a full portion at his main residence and nothing at the other.</td>
<td>如上所述，在七日事務的主題下，技術上存在比丘可以在兩個住處入雨安居的可能性。如果兩個地方的施主都指定布施雨安居的布匹，那麼如果比丘一半時間在一個住處，一半時間在另一個住處，則應在這裡給他一半份額，在那裡給他一半份額。或者，如果他在其中一個住處待的時間比另一個住處多，則應在其主要住處給予全額布匹，而在另一處則不給予。</td>

If the bhikkhus do not spread a kaṭhina, the Commentary states that they hold this right for the month after the end of the Rains-residence.</td>

If not, he may participate in an Invitation with any fellow bhikkhus who have completed the second period of Rains-residence along with him.
