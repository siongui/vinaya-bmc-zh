   * - The Dhamma and Vinaya impinge in such detail on so many areas of one’s life that no new bhikkhu can be expected to master them in a short time. For this reason, the Buddha arranged for a period of apprenticeship—called *nissaya*, or dependence—in which every newly ordained bhikkhu must train under the guidance of an experienced bhikkhu for at least five years before he can be considered competent to look after himself.

     - 法與律對一個人生活的許多方面都有非常詳細的影響，以至於不可能指望新比丘能在短時間內掌握它們。因此，佛陀安排了一段學徒期，稱為“\ *nissaya*\ ”或“依止”，每一位新出家的比丘必須在有經驗的比丘的指導下修行至少五年，才可以被認為有能力照顧自己。

   * - This apprenticeship has formed the human context in which the practice of the Buddha’s teachings has been passed down for the past 2,600 years. To overlook it is to miss one of the basic parameters of the life of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus we will discuss it here first, before going on to the individual training rules of the Pāṭimokkha.

     - 這種學徒期讓佛陀教法薪傳至今已將近二千六百年之久。忽視它就是錯過法與律之生活的基本要素之一。因此，我們先在這裡討論它，然後再討論《波羅提木叉》的個別學處。

   * - Dependence is of two sorts: dependence on one’s preceptor (*upajjhāya*) and dependence on a teacher (*ācariya*). The relationships are similar—and in many details, identical—so the following discussion will use the word *mentor* to cover both preceptor and teacher wherever the pattern applies to both, and will distinguish them only where the patterns differ.

     - 依止有兩種：對戒師的依止（\ *upajjhāya*\ ，古譯為\ *和尚*\ ）和對教授師的依止（\ *ācariya*\ ，古譯為\ *阿闍梨*\ ）。這些關係是相似的，並且在許多細節上是相同的，因此下面的討論，遇到二者通用相同的模式時，將使用\ *依止師*\ 一詞來涵蓋戒師和教授師，並且僅在模式不同的地方區分戒師與教授師。

   * - **Choosing a mentor**
     - **選擇依止師**

   * - Before ordination, one must choose a bhikkhu to act as one’s preceptor. The Mahāvagga (I.36-37) gives a long list of qualifications a bhikkhu must meet before he can act as a preceptor, while the Commentary divides the list into two levels: ideal and minimal qualifications. A bhikkhu who lacks the minimal qualifications incurs a dukkaṭa if he acts as a preceptor; a bhikkhu who meets the minimal but lacks the ideal qualifications is not an ideal person to give guidance, but he incurs no penalty in doing so.

     - 在受具足戒之前，必須選擇一位比丘作為自己的戒師。\ `《大品》（一.36-37）`_\ 給出了比丘在能成為戒師之前必須滿足的一長串資格，而《義註》則將該列表分為兩個層次：理想資格和最低資格。缺乏最低資格的比丘，如果他擔任戒師，犯《突吉羅》。達到最低資格但缺乏理想資格的比丘不是給予指導的理想人選，但他擔任戒師不犯戒。

   * - *The ideal qualifications:* The preceptor should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release; and should be able to train another person to the same level of attainment. He should have faith, a sense of shame, a sense of compunction (in the American sense of the term, i.e., an reluctance to do wrong for fear of its consequences), persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness (according to the Sub-commentary, this means that he is constantly mindful of whatever mental object is before the mind). He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and be possessed of right view. (This last point, the Commentary says, means that he does not adhere to the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism.) He should be competent to tend to a sick pupil or to find someone who will tend to him, and to dispel dissatisfaction in a pupil who wants to leave the celibate life.

     - *理想資格：*\ 戒師應有阿羅漢的戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見；並且應該能夠訓練他人達到相同的成就。他應該有信心、慚、愧（此詞在美式意義為因害怕後果而不願做錯事）、精進、不失正念（根據《複註》，這意味著他持續地正念於心面前的任何心理對象）。他應不違犯輕重諸戒，並且具足正見。（《義註》說，此處的正見意指不執著常見或斷見這二種極端。）他應該有能力照顧生病的弟子或找到願意照顧他的人，並且在弟子想離開梵行生活而還俗時，消除弟子的不滿。
