   * - The Dhamma and Vinaya impinge in such detail on so many areas of one’s life that no new bhikkhu can be expected to master them in a short time. For this reason, the Buddha arranged for a period of apprenticeship—called *nissaya*, or dependence—in which every newly ordained bhikkhu must train under the guidance of an experienced bhikkhu for at least five years before he can be considered competent to look after himself.

     - 法與律對一個人生活的許多方面都有非常詳細的影響，以至於不可能指望新比丘能在短時間內掌握它們。因此，佛陀安排了一段學徒期，稱為“\ *nissaya*\ ”或“依止”，每一位新出家的比丘必須在有經驗的比丘的指導下修行至少五年，才可以被認為有能力照顧自己。

   * - This apprenticeship has formed the human context in which the practice of the Buddha’s teachings has been passed down for the past 2,600 years. To overlook it is to miss one of the basic parameters of the life of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus we will discuss it here first, before going on to the individual training rules of the Pāṭimokkha.

     - 這種學徒期讓佛陀教法薪傳至今已將近二千六百年之久。忽視它就是錯過法與律之生活的基本要素之一。因此，我們先在這裡討論它，然後再討論《波羅提木叉》的個別學處。

   * - Dependence is of two sorts: dependence on one’s preceptor (*upajjhāya*) and dependence on a teacher (*ācariya*). The relationships are similar—and in many details, identical—so the following discussion will use the word *mentor* to cover both preceptor and teacher wherever the pattern applies to both, and will distinguish them only where the patterns differ.

     - 依止有兩種：對戒師的依止（\ *upajjhāya*\ ，古譯為\ *和尚*\ ）和對教授師的依止（\ *ācariya*\ ，古譯為\ *阿闍梨*\ ）。這些關係是相似的，並且在許多細節上是相同的，因此下面的討論，遇到二者通用相同的模式時，將使用\ *依止師*\ 一詞來涵蓋戒師和教授師，並且僅在模式不同的地方區分戒師與教授師。

   * - **Choosing a mentor**
     - **選擇依止師**

   * - Before ordination, one must choose a bhikkhu to act as one’s preceptor. The Mahāvagga (I.36-37) gives a long list of qualifications a bhikkhu must meet before he can act as a preceptor, while the Commentary divides the list into two levels: ideal and minimal qualifications. A bhikkhu who lacks the minimal qualifications incurs a dukkaṭa if he acts as a preceptor; a bhikkhu who meets the minimal but lacks the ideal qualifications is not an ideal person to give guidance, but he incurs no penalty in doing so.

     - 在受具足戒之前，必須選擇一位比丘作為自己的戒師。\ `《大品》（一.36-37）`_\ 給出了比丘在能成為戒師之前必須滿足的一長串資格，而《義註》則將該列表分為兩個層次：理想資格和最低資格。缺乏最低資格的比丘，如果他擔任戒師，犯《突吉羅》。達到最低資格但缺乏理想資格的比丘不是給予指導的理想人選，但他擔任戒師不犯戒。

   * - *The ideal qualifications:* The preceptor should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release; and should be able to train another person to the same level of attainment. He should have faith, a sense of shame, a sense of compunction (in the American sense of the term, i.e., an reluctance to do wrong for fear of its consequences), persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness (according to the Sub-commentary, this means that he is constantly mindful of whatever mental object is before the mind). He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and be possessed of right view. (This last point, the Commentary says, means that he does not adhere to the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism.) He should be competent to tend to a sick pupil or to find someone who will tend to him, and to dispel dissatisfaction in a pupil who wants to leave the celibate life.

     - *理想資格：*\ 戒師應有阿羅漢的戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見；並且應該能夠訓練他人達到相同的成就。他應該有信心、慚、愧（此詞在美式意義為因害怕後果而不願做錯事）、精進、不失正念（根據《複註》，這意味著他持續地正念於心面前的任何心理對象）。他應不違犯輕重諸戒，並且具足正見。（《義註》說，此處的正見意指不執著常見或斷見這二種極端。）他應該有能力照顧生病的弟子或找到願意照顧他的人，並且在弟子想離開梵行生活而還俗時，消除弟子的不滿。

   * - The Mahāvagga does not say outright that these are ideal, as opposed to minimal, qualifications, but the Commentary offers as proof the fact that one of a pupil’s duties is to try to allay any dissatisfaction that may arise in his preceptor. If all preceptors were arahants, no case of this sort would ever arise and there would be no need to mention it. Thus the Commentary concludes that arahantship, although ideal in a preceptor, is not necessary.

     - 《大品》並沒有直截了當地說，相對於最低資格，這些是理想資格，但《義註》提供了這樣一個事實作為證據：弟子的職責之一是盡力減輕他的導師可能產生的任何不滿。如果所有比丘都是阿羅漢，這種事就不會發生，也不用提及。因此，《義註》的結論是，阿羅漢果雖然對戒師來說是理想的，但並不是必要的。

   * - *The minimal qualifications:* The preceptor must be learned and competent. According to the Commentary, this means that he knows enough of the Dhamma and Vinaya to govern a following and is competent enough to know what is and is not an offense. He must also be competent enough to allay, in line with the Dhamma, any anxiety that has arisen in his pupil; must know what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. He must have detailed knowledge of both Pāṭimokkhas (the one for the bhikkhus and the one for the bhikkhunīs) and be able to train the pupil in the bhikkhus’ customs (Com.: this means that he knows the Khandhakas), in the basic rules of the chaste life (Sub-com.: he knows both Vibhaṅgas), the higher Dhamma, and the higher Vinaya. He must be able, in line with the Dhamma, to pry his pupil away from a wrong view or to find someone who will help pry him away. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for ten years or more.

     - *最低資格：*\ 依止師必須博學且有能力。根據《義註》，這意味著他對法與律有足夠的了解來管理追隨者，並且有足夠的能力知道什麼是犯戒和不是犯戒。他還必須有足夠的能力，按照法，減輕弟子中出現的任何焦慮；必須知道什麼是犯戒，什麼是不犯戒，什麼是輕罪，什麼是重罪，以及懺罪的方法。他必須詳細了解兩部《波羅提木叉》（比丘的一部和比丘尼的一部），並且能夠訓練弟子遵循比丘的習俗（《義註》：這意味著他了解《犍度》），遵循梵行生活的基本戒條（《複註》：他知道兩部《經分別》），更高的法和更高的律。他必須能夠按照法，使弟子遠離邪見，或找到能幫助他脫離邪見的人。而且──最基本的要求──他必須出家為比丘十年或以上。

   * - If, for some reason, the new bhikkhu lives in a separate monastery from his preceptor, he must take dependence under a teacher, whose qualifications are precisely the same as those for a preceptor. Because the Mahāvagga (I.72.1) gives a dukkaṭa for taking dependence under an unconscientious bhikkhu, the new bhikkhu is allowed four to five days to observe his potential teacher’s conduct before taking dependence under him (Mv.I.72.2).

     - 如果因為某些原因，新比丘與戒師住在不同的寺院，他就必須依止一位老師，而老師的資格與戒師的資格完全相同。因為\ `《大品》（一.72.1）`_\ 提到，依止一個不負責任的比丘，犯《突吉羅》，所以新比丘在依止之前可以有四到五天的時間來觀察他潛在的老師的行為（\ `《大品》.一.72.2`_\ ）。
