   * - The Dhamma and Vinaya impinge in such detail on so many areas of one’s life that no new bhikkhu can be expected to master them in a short time. For this reason, the Buddha arranged for a period of apprenticeship—called *nissaya*, or dependence—in which every newly ordained bhikkhu must train under the guidance of an experienced bhikkhu for at least five years before he can be considered competent to look after himself.

     - 法與律對一個人生活的許多方面都有非常詳細的影響，以至於不可能指望新比丘能在短時間內掌握它們。因此，佛陀安排了一段學徒期，稱為“\ *nissaya*\ ”或“依止”，每一位新出家的比丘必須在有經驗的比丘的指導下修行至少五年，才可以被認為有能力照顧自己。

   * - This apprenticeship has formed the human context in which the practice of the Buddha’s teachings has been passed down for the past 2,600 years. To overlook it is to miss one of the basic parameters of the life of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus we will discuss it here first, before going on to the individual training rules of the Pāṭimokkha.

     - 這種學徒期讓佛陀教法薪傳至今已將近二千六百年之久。忽視它就是錯過法與律之生活的基本要素之一。因此，我們先在這裡討論它，然後再討論《波羅提木叉》的個別學處。

   * - Dependence is of two sorts: dependence on one’s preceptor (*upajjhāya*) and dependence on a teacher (*ācariya*). The relationships are similar—and in many details, identical—so the following discussion will use the word *mentor* to cover both preceptor and teacher wherever the pattern applies to both, and will distinguish them only where the patterns differ.

     - 依止有兩種：對戒師的依止（\ *upajjhāya*\ ，古譯為\ *和尚*\ ）和對教授師的依止（\ *ācariya*\ ，古譯為\ *阿闍梨*\ ）。這些關係是相似的，並且在許多細節上是相同的，因此下面的討論，遇到二者通用相同的模式時，將使用\ *依止師*\ 一詞來涵蓋戒師和教授師，並且僅在模式不同的地方區分戒師與教授師。

   * - **Choosing a mentor**
     - **選擇依止師**

   * - Before ordination, one must choose a bhikkhu to act as one’s preceptor. The Mahāvagga (I.36-37) gives a long list of qualifications a bhikkhu must meet before he can act as a preceptor, while the Commentary divides the list into two levels: ideal and minimal qualifications. A bhikkhu who lacks the minimal qualifications incurs a dukkaṭa if he acts as a preceptor; a bhikkhu who meets the minimal but lacks the ideal qualifications is not an ideal person to give guidance, but he incurs no penalty in doing so.

     - 在受具足戒之前，必須選擇一位比丘作為自己的戒師。\ `《大品》（一.36-37）`_\ 給出了比丘在能成為戒師之前必須滿足的一長串資格，而《義註》則將該列表分為兩個層次：理想資格和最低資格。缺乏最低資格的比丘，如果他擔任戒師，犯《突吉羅》。達到最低資格但缺乏理想資格的比丘不是給予指導的理想人選，但他擔任戒師不犯戒。

   * - *The ideal qualifications:* The preceptor should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release; and should be able to train another person to the same level of attainment. He should have faith, a sense of shame, a sense of compunction (in the American sense of the term, i.e., an reluctance to do wrong for fear of its consequences), persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness (according to the Sub-commentary, this means that he is constantly mindful of whatever mental object is before the mind). He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and be possessed of right view. (This last point, the Commentary says, means that he does not adhere to the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism.) He should be competent to tend to a sick pupil or to find someone who will tend to him, and to dispel dissatisfaction in a pupil who wants to leave the celibate life.

     - *理想資格：*\ 戒師應有阿羅漢的戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見；並且應該能夠訓練他人達到相同的成就。他應該有信心、慚、愧（此詞在美式意義為因害怕後果而不願做錯事）、精進、不失正念（根據《複註》，這意味著他持續地正念於心面前的任何心理對象）。他應不違犯輕重諸戒，並且具足正見。（《義註》說，此處的正見意指不執著常見或斷見這二種極端。）他應該有能力照顧生病的弟子或找到願意照顧他的人，並且在弟子想離開梵行生活而還俗時，消除弟子的不滿。

   * - The Mahāvagga does not say outright that these are ideal, as opposed to minimal, qualifications, but the Commentary offers as proof the fact that one of a pupil’s duties is to try to allay any dissatisfaction that may arise in his preceptor. If all preceptors were arahants, no case of this sort would ever arise and there would be no need to mention it. Thus the Commentary concludes that arahantship, although ideal in a preceptor, is not necessary.

     - 《大品》並沒有直截了當地說，相對於最低資格，這些是理想資格，但《義註》提供了這樣一個事實作為證據：弟子的職責之一是盡力減輕他的戒師可能產生的任何不滿。如果所有比丘都是阿羅漢，這種事就不會發生，也不用提及。因此，《義註》的結論是，阿羅漢果雖然對戒師來說是理想的，但並不是必要的。

   * - *The minimal qualifications:* The preceptor must be learned and competent. According to the Commentary, this means that he knows enough of the Dhamma and Vinaya to govern a following and is competent enough to know what is and is not an offense. He must also be competent enough to allay, in line with the Dhamma, any anxiety that has arisen in his pupil; must know what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. He must have detailed knowledge of both Pāṭimokkhas (the one for the bhikkhus and the one for the bhikkhunīs) and be able to train the pupil in the bhikkhus’ customs (Com.: this means that he knows the Khandhakas), in the basic rules of the chaste life (Sub-com.: he knows both Vibhaṅgas), the higher Dhamma, and the higher Vinaya. He must be able, in line with the Dhamma, to pry his pupil away from a wrong view or to find someone who will help pry him away. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for ten years or more.

     - *最低資格：*\ 依止師必須博學且有能力。根據《義註》，這意味著他對法與律有足夠的了解來管理追隨者，並且有足夠的能力知道什麼是犯戒和不是犯戒。他還必須有足夠的能力，按照法，減輕弟子中出現的任何焦慮；必須知道什麼是犯戒，什麼是不犯戒，什麼是輕罪，什麼是重罪，以及懺罪的方法。他必須詳細了解兩部《波羅提木叉》（比丘的一部和比丘尼的一部），並且能夠訓練弟子遵循比丘的習俗（《義註》：這意味著他了解《犍度》），遵循梵行生活的基本戒條（《複註》：他知道兩部《經分別》），更高的法和更高的律。他必須能夠按照法，使弟子遠離邪見，或找到能幫助他脫離邪見的人。而且──最基本的要求──他必須出家為比丘十年或以上。

   * - If, for some reason, the new bhikkhu lives in a separate monastery from his preceptor, he must take dependence under a teacher, whose qualifications are precisely the same as those for a preceptor. Because the Mahāvagga (I.72.1) gives a dukkaṭa for taking dependence under an unconscientious bhikkhu, the new bhikkhu is allowed four to five days to observe his potential teacher’s conduct before taking dependence under him (`Mv.I.72.2`_).

     - 如果因為某些原因，新比丘與戒師住在不同的寺院，他就必須依止一位教授師，而教授師的資格與戒師的資格完全相同。因為\ `《大品》（一.72.1）`_\ 提到，依止一個不負責任的比丘，犯《突吉羅》，所以新比丘在依止之前可以有四到五天的時間來觀察他潛在的教授師的行為（\ `《大品》.一.72.2`_\ ）。

   * - **Taking dependence**
     - **請求依止**

   * - Prior to his ordination—and usually, as part of the ceremony itself—the candidate must make a formal request for dependence from his preceptor. The procedure is as follows:

     - 在受具足戒之前——通常是儀式本身的一部分——求具足戒者必須向其戒師提出正式的依止請求。程序如下：

   * - Arranging his upper robe over his left shoulder, leaving his right shoulder bare, he bows down to the preceptor and then, kneeling with his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, repeats the following passage three times:

     - 齊整上衣披於左肩，偏袒右肩，向戒師頂禮，然後跪下，雙手合掌放在胸前，重複以下片段三遍：

   * - *Upajjhāyo me bhante hohi,*

     - 

   * - which means, “Venerable sir, be my preceptor.”

     - 意思是：“尊者，請做我的戒師。”

   * - If the preceptor responds with any of these words—*sāhu* (very well), *lahu* (certainly), *opāyikaṁ* (all right), *paṭirūpaṁ* (it is proper), or *pāsādikena sampādehi* (attain consummation (in the practice) in an amicable way)—the dependence has taken hold. `Mv.I.25.7`_ adds that if the preceptor indicates any of these meanings by gesture, that also counts; and according to the Commentary, the same holds true if he makes any equivalent statement.

     - 如果戒師用以下任何一個字來回應：sāhu（很好）、lahu（當然）、opāyikaṁ（好的）、paṭirūpaṁ（這是適當的）或 pāsādikena sampādehi（應以淨信而成就\ :small:`[英文直譯：以友善的方式（在修行中）獲得圓滿]`\ ） ——依止就算成立。\ `《大品》.一.25.7`_\ 補充說，如果戒師透過手勢表明任何這些含義，依止也算成立；根據《義註》，如果他做出任何同等的陳述，依止都算成立。

   * - If, after his ordination, the new bhikkhu needs to request dependence from a teacher, the procedure is the same, except that the request he makes three times is this:

     - 如果新比丘受具足戒後，需要向教授師請求依止，程序是一樣的，只是他提出的三次請求是這樣的：

   * - *Ācariyo me bhante hohi; āyasmato nissāya vacchāmi,*

     - 

   * - which means, “Venerable sir, be my teacher; I will live in dependence on you.” (`Mv.I.32.2`_)

     - 意思是：「尊者，請做我的教授師；我將依止尊者而住。”（\ `《大品》.一.32.2`_\ ）

   * - **Duties**
     - **職責**

   * - The Mahāvagga (I.25.6; 32.1) states that a pupil should regard his mentor as a father; and the mentor, the pupil as his son. It then goes on to delineate this relationship as a set of reciprocal duties.

     - 《大品》（\ `一.25.6`_\ ；\ `32.1`_\ ）指出，弟子應視依止師為父親；依止師應視弟子如兒子。然後，它繼續將這種關係描述為一組互惠的職責。

   * - **The pupil’s duties to his mentor**
     - **弟子對依止師的職責**

   * - The pupil’s duties to his mentor fall into the following five categories:
     - 弟子對其依止師的職責分為以下五類：

   * - *1. Attending to the mentor’s personal needs.* The Mahāvagga goes into great detail on this topic, giving precise instructions dealing with every conceivable way a pupil can be of service to his mentor. The Vinaya-mukha tries to reduce these duties to a few general principles, but this misses much of what the Mahāvagga has to offer, for the details are what show fine examples of mindfulness in action—the best way to fold a robe, clean a dwelling, and so forth—as well as indications of how one can use this aspect of one’s training to develop sensitivity to the needs of others. Still, the detailed instructions are so extensive that they would overburden the discussion in this chapter, so I have saved them for `Appendix X`_. Here I will simply give them in outline form. The pupil should:

     - *1. 關注依止師的個人需求。* 《大品》對這個主題進行了非常詳細的闡述，對於弟子為依止師服務的每一種可能的方式都給出了精確的指示。《戒律入口》試圖將這些職責簡化為一些一般原則，但這錯過了《大品》所提供的大部分內容，因為細節是正念在行動中的典範——折疊袈裟、打掃住所等的最佳方法——以及如何利用訓練的這一方面來培養對他人需求的敏感度的指示。儘管如此，詳細的說明是如此廣泛，以至於它們會使本章的討論負擔過重，因此我將它們保存在\ `附錄十`_\ 中。在這裡，我將簡單地以概要形式給出它們。弟子應該：

       .. TODO FIXME: replace link to 附錄十

   * - a\. Arrange his mentor’s toiletries for his morning wash-up.
     - a\. 為他的依止師準備好洗漱用品，供他早上洗漱。

   * - b\. Arrange his seat and food for his morning conjey (if he has any) and clean up after he is finished.
     - b\. 安排依止師的座位和早餐的食物（如果有的話），並在餐後清理乾淨。

   * - c\. Arrange his robes and bowl for his alms round.
     - c\. 準備依止師入村托缽所需的袈裟與缽。

   * - d\. Follow him on his alms round, if the mentor so desires, and take his robes and bowl when he returns.
     - d\. 若依止師需要時，隨從其托缽，回程時，代為攜持袈裟與缽。

   * - e\. Arrange his seat and food for his alms meal and clean up afterwards.
     - e\. 安排依止師的座位和托缽所得食物，以及餐後清理乾淨。

   * - f\. Prepare his bath. If he goes to the sauna, go with him and attend to his needs.
     - f\. 準備依止師沐浴。如果依止師去蒸汽(桑拿)浴室，弟子應同入，並照料所需。

   * - g\. Study the Dhamma and Vinaya from him when he is prepared to teach. (The Mahāvagga describes this as “recitation” and “interrogation.” Recitation, according to the Commentary, means learning to memorize passages; interrogation, learning to investigate their meaning.)

     - g\. 當依止師擬給予教導時，弟子應聽受研學法與律。（《大品》將其描述為「誦」和「問」。根據《義註》，「誦」的意思是學習記憶段落；「問」是學習探究其意義。）

   * - h\. Clean his dwelling and other parts of his dwelling complex, such as the restroom and storage rooms, when they get dirty.
     - h\. 當依止師的住所和住所區域的其他部分（例如衛生間和儲藏室）變髒時，進行清掃。

   * - *2. Assisting the mentor in any problems he may have with regard to the Dhamma and Vinaya.* The Mahāvagga lists the following examples:
     - *2. 協助依止師解決有關法與律的任何問題。*\ 《大品》列出了以下例子：

   * - a\. If the mentor begins to feel dissatisfaction with the celibate life, the pupil should try to allay that dissatisfaction or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.
     - a\. 如果依止師開始對梵行生活感到不滿，弟子應該設法減輕其不滿，或者找其他可以減輕其不滿的人，或者給予他法的開示。

   * - b\. If the preceptor begins to feel anxiety over his conduct with regard to the rules, the pupil should try to dispel that anxiety or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.
     - b\. 如果戒師開始對自己遵守戒律的行為感到焦慮，弟子應該設法消除其焦慮，或者找其他可以消除其焦慮的人，或者給予他法的開示。

   * - c\. If the preceptor begins to hold to wrong views, the pupil should try to pry him away from those views or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.
     - c\. 如果戒師開始持有邪見，弟子應該設法規勸他放棄邪見，或者找其他可以規勸他放棄邪見的人，或者給予他法的開示。

   * - d\. If the preceptor has committed a saṅghādisesa offense, the pupil should—to the best of his ability—help with the arrangements for penance, probation, and rehabilitation, or find someone else who can.
     - d\. 如果戒師犯了《僧殘》罪，弟子應該盡其所能幫助安排別住（parivāsa）、摩那埵(mānatta)、與出罪(abbhāna)，或找其他可以幫助的人。

   * - e\. If the Community is going to carry out a transaction against the mentor, the pupil should try to dissuade them from it. According to the Commentary, this means that he should go to the various members of the Community individually before the meeting and try to dissuade them from going through with the transaction. If he can’t dissuade them, he should try to get them to lessen its severity (say, from banishment to censure). If they are justified in carrying out the transaction, though, he should not object while the meeting is in progress. Once they have carried out the transaction, he should concentrate on helping his mentor behave so that they will rescind the transaction as quickly as possible.

     - e\. 如果僧團要對依止師施行羯磨，弟子應該盡力勸阻他們。根據《義註》，這意味著他應該在僧團集會之前單獨去找僧團的各個成員，並試圖勸阻他們施行羯磨。如果他無法勸阻他們，他應該設法讓他們減輕其嚴重程度（例如，從驅出羯磨減為呵責羯磨）。不過，如果他們有正當理由施行羯磨，他不應該在僧團集會進行中提出反對。一旦羯磨完成，他就應該專注於幫助他的依止師遵從僧團決議守規矩，以便他們盡快解除羯磨。

   * - *3. Washing, making, and dyeing the mentor’s robes.*
     - *3. 依止師袈裟的洗滌、縫製、染色。*

   * - *4. Showing loyalty and respect for the mentor.*
     - *4. 表現對依止師的忠誠和尊敬。*

   * - a\. The pupil should neither give nor receive gifts, nor give or receive services to/from others without first obtaining the mentor’s permission. According to the Commentary, *others* here means people who are on bad terms with the mentor.
     - a\. 未得到依止師的允許之前，弟子不應贈送物品給他人，或接受他人贈送的物品，亦不應奉事他人或接受他人的奉事。根據《義註》，這裡的「他人」意指：與依止師關係不睦的人。

   * - b\. The pupil should obtain his mentor’s permission before entering a village, going to a cemetery (to meditate, says, the Commentary), or leaving the district in which they live. The Commentary notes, though, that if the mentor refuses one’s request the first time, one should ask up to two more times, presenting one’s reasons as best one can. If the mentor still refuses, the pupil should reflect on his situation. If staying with the mentor is not helping his education and meditation, and if the mentor seems to want him to stay simply to have someone to look after his (the mentor’s) needs, the pupil is justified in leaving and taking dependence with a new mentor in his new residence.

     - b\. 弟子必須得到依止師的允許之後，才能入村莊、入墓地（《義註》說：去修行）或離開共住的區域。然而，《義註》指出：如果依止師拒絕弟子第一次的請求，弟子應當再請求最多兩次，並儘可能地陳述自己的理由。如果依止師仍然拒絕，弟子應反思自己的情況，如果繼續與依止師共住對自己的教育與修行沒有幫助，而依止師要弟子留下似乎只是因為需要人奉事，如此，弟子有正當理由離開，並在新住處依止新的依止師。

   * - *5. Caring for the mentor when he falls ill,* not leaving him until he either recovers or passes away (`Mv.I.25`_).
     - *5. 當依止師生病時照顧他，*\ 直到他康復或去世時才離開（`《大品》.一.25`_）。
