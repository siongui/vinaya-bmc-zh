          *In case a king, a royal official, a brahman, or a householder sends a robe fund for the sake of a bhikkhu via a messenger, (saying,) “Having purchased a robe with this robe fund, clothe the bhikkhu named so-and-so with a robe”: If the messenger, approaching the bhikkhu, should say, “This is a robe fund being delivered for the sake of the venerable one. May the venerable one accept this robe fund,” then the bhikkhu is to tell the messenger: “We do not accept robe funds, my friend. We accept robes (robe-cloth) as are proper according to season.”*

     - .. container:: notification

          *若國王、王官、婆羅門、居士透過使者為比丘送衣資，（說：）「用此衣資購買衣後，送衣給某某比丘披著」：如果使者接近比丘時如此說：「這是為尊者而交付的衣資。願尊者接受此衣資。」然後，比丘要告訴使者：「我們不接受衣資，我的朋友。我們接受根據季節合適的衣（衣布料）。」*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If the messenger should say to the bhikkhu, “Does the venerable one have a steward?” then, bhikkhus, if the bhikkhu desires a robe, he may indicate a steward—either a monastery attendant or a lay follower—(saying,) “That, my friend, is the bhikkhus’ steward.”*

     - .. container:: notification

          *若使者對比丘如此說：「尊者有服務者嗎？」那麼，比丘們，如果比丘想要一件衣，他可以指示一位服務者——或者是寺院侍者，或者是在家人——（說：）「我的朋友，那是比丘的服務者。」*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If the messenger, having instructed the steward and going to the bhikkhu, should say, “I have instructed the steward the venerable one indicated. May the venerable one go (to him) and he will clothe you with a robe in season,” then the bhikkhu, desiring a robe and approaching the steward, may prompt and remind him two or three times, “I have need of a robe.” Should (the steward) produce the robe after being prompted and reminded two or three times, that is good.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果使者在交代了服務者之後，前往比丘那裡，如此說：「我已經交代了尊者所指示的服務者。願尊者前往，他會在適當的時候送衣給您披著。」然後，比丘想要衣，就到服務者那裡，可以催促、提醒他兩三遍：「我需要衣。」如果在兩、三次催促、提醒時獲得該衣，這實在很好。*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If he should not produce the robe, (the bhikkhu) should stand in silence four times, five times, six times at most for that purpose. Should (the steward) produce the robe after (the bhikkhu) has stood in silence for that purpose four, five, six times at most, that is good.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果沒有獲得，那麼（比丘）就應該默立四次、五次、至多六次。如果（服務者）在（比丘）為此目的而默立四次、五次、至多六次之後，獲得該衣，這實在很好*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If he should not produce the robe (at that point), should he then produce the robe after (the bhikkhu) has endeavored further than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *假如沒有獲得衣（此時），如果在（比丘）更努力之後獲得衣，尼薩耆波逸提。*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If he should not produce (the robe), then the bhikkhu himself should go to the place from which the robe fund was brought, or a messenger should be sent (to say), “The robe fund that you, venerable sirs, sent for the sake of the bhikkhu has given no benefit to the bhikkhu at all. May you be united with what is yours. May what is yours not be lost.” This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果沒有獲得（衣），那麼比丘就應該親自到衣資帶來的地方，或者派一個使者（說）：「尊敬的先生們，你們曾指定為比丘所送去的衣資根本沒有給比丘帶來任何利益。願屬於你的回歸於你。願屬於你的不失去。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The protocols surrounding gifts of money and their proper use are quite complex—much more complex than even this long training rule would indicate—and require a detailed explanation. What follows is an attempt to make them clear. If it seems long and involved, remember that the purpose of the protocols is to free bhikkhus from the even more bothersome worries and complexities that come with participating in buying, selling, and monetary matters in general.

     - 圍繞金錢贈禮及其正確使用的行儀相當複雜——甚至比這個冗長的學處所表明的還要複雜得多——並且需要詳細的解釋。接下來是試著讓它們變得清晰。如果它看起來又長又複雜，請記住，這些行儀的目的是讓比丘擺脫參與一般買賣和貨幣事務所帶來的更麻煩的擔憂和複雜性。

   * - This rule is one of four nissaggiya pācittiya rules covering a bhikkhu’s proper relationship to money. The others are `NP 18`_, 19_, & 20_. Although they sometimes seem to be splitting hairs, they focus precisely on the two acts involving money that are most burdensome to a sensitive mind: In the act of accepting money, or having it accepted in one’s name, one is accepting all the cares, responsibilities, and dangers that come with its ownership; in the act of arranging a trade, one is accepting responsibility for the fairness of the trade—that it undervalues neither the generosity of the person who donated the money nor the goods or services of the person receiving the money in exchange.

     - 本戒條是四個涉及比丘與金錢的適當關係的《尼薩耆波逸提》戒條之一。其他的是\ `《捨墮》一八`_\、\ `一九`_\和\ `二十`_\。儘管他們有時似乎在吹毛求疵，但他們恰恰聚焦於對敏銳的心來說最繁重的兩種涉及金錢的行為：在接受金錢或以個人名義接受金錢的行為中，也接受了所有的擔心和責任，以及其所有權所帶來的危險；在安排交易的行為中，也接受了對交易公平性的責任——既不低估捐贈金錢者的慷慨，也不低估接受金錢作為交換的人的商品或服務。

   * - Thus to protect a bhikkhu from these mental burdens, this rule sets up protocols so that lay donors may have the convenience of dedicating amounts of money and other valuables to provide for a bhikkhu’s needs, and so that the bhikkhu may benefit from such gifts without having to bear the responsibilities of ownership or of having to arrange fair trades.

     - 因此，為了保護比丘免受這些精神負擔，本戒條制定了行儀，以便在家布施者可以方便地奉獻大量的金錢和其他貴重物品來滿足比丘的需要，這樣比丘就可以從這些贈禮中受益，而無需承擔所有權責任或必須安排公平交易。

   * - If a bhikkhu follows the protocols recommended here, the money placed with the steward still belongs to the donor, and the responsibility for making a fair trade lies with the steward. The bhikkhu’s only responsibility is to inform the original donor if, after a reasonable number of promptings, the steward entrusted with the money does not provide him with the requisite the donor had in mind, and then let the donor look after the matter if he/she cares to.

     - 如果比丘遵循這裡推薦的行儀，放在服務者那裡的錢仍然屬於施主，而公平交易的責任則由服務者承擔。比丘的唯一責任是，如果經過合理次數的提示後，受託金錢的服務者沒有向他提供施主心目中的必需品，則通知原始施主，然後讓施主處理此事，如果他/她在乎。

   * - Although the rule itself mentions only funds for robe-cloth intended for individual bhikkhus, we should note from the outset that the Commentary uses the Great Standards to extend it to cover all funds—composed of money, jewels, commodities, land, livestock, or other valuables that bhikkhus are not allowed to accept—not only for an individual bhikkhu’s robe-cloth but also for any type of requisite. And it further extrapolates from this rule to cover funds for Communities and groups of bhikkhus, as well as impersonal funds for such things as buildings and—in the modern world—the printing of books.

     - 雖然戒條本身只提到了供個別比丘使用的衣資，但我們從一開始就應該注意，《義註》使用《四大教示》將其擴展到涵蓋所有資金，包括金錢、珠寶、商品、土地、牲畜或其他比丘不准接受的貴重物品－不僅是比丘個人的衣，也包括任何類型的必需品。它進一步從本戒條推斷出涵蓋僧團和比丘團體的資金，以及用於比如建築物和（在現代世界）書籍印刷等項目的非個人資金。

   * - **The money rules & allowances: an overview**
     - **金錢戒及開緣：概述**

   * - NP 18 forbids a bhikkhu from accepting gifts of money, from getting others to accept them, and from consenting to gifts of money meant for him being placed down next to him. `NP 19`_ & 20_ forbid him from engaging in buying, selling, or bartering, regardless of whether it involves money. `Mv.VI.34.21`_, however, contains the following allowance, called the Meṇḍaka Allowance, after the donor who inspired it:

     - `《捨墮》一八`_\禁止比丘接受金錢贈禮，禁止讓他人接受金錢贈禮，以及禁止同意將本應為他準備的金錢贈禮放在他旁邊。\ `《捨墮》一九`_\和\ `二十`_\禁止他從事買賣或以物易物，無論是否涉及金錢。 然而，\ `《大品》.六.34.21`_\包含以下開緣，稱為 Meṇḍaka 開緣，以發起它的施主的名字命名：

   * - .. container:: notification

          “There are people of conviction and confidence, bhikkhus, who place gold in the hand of stewards, (saying,) ‘With this, give the master whatever is allowable.’ I allow you, bhikkhus, to accept whatever is allowable coming from that. But in no way at all do I say that gold or silver is to be accepted or sought for.”

     - .. container:: notification

          「比丘們，有一些有信念和信心的人，他們把黃金放在服務者的手中，（說）『用這個，給尊者任何允許的東西。』我允許你們，比丘們，接受來自那裡的任何允許的東西。但我絕不是說金銀應該被接受或尋求。」

   * - Even given this allowance, though, it is important that the bhikkhu, in his dealings with the steward, does not say or do anything that would transgress `NP 18-20`_. At the same time, it is important that he not abuse the steward’s services. Otherwise the steward will never want to perform this service for bhikkhus again. This is the main point of the origin story to this rule:

     - 然而，即使給予了這種開緣，比丘在與服務者打交道時，不要說或做任何違反\ `《捨墮》一八至二十`_\的事情，這一點很重要。同時，重要的是他不能濫用服務者的服務。否則，服務者將永遠不想再為比丘做這服務。這是本戒條\ `起源故事 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0311a07>`_\的要點：

   * - .. container:: notification

          “Then Ven. Upananda the Sakyan approached the lay follower (his steward) and on arrival said, ‘My friend, I have need of a robe.’

     - .. container:: notification

          「時，釋迦族優波難陀尊者來到優婆塞（他的服務者）處，抵達後說道：『我的朋友，我需要一件衣。』

   * - .. container:: notification

          “‘Wait for the rest of today, venerable sir. Today there is a town meeting, and the town has made an agreement that whoever comes late is fined 50 (*kahāpaṇas*).’

     - .. container:: notification

          「『大德，請等待今天剩下的時間。今天有鎮會議，鎮裡達成了協議，誰遲到，罰款50（\ *kahāpaṇa*\）。』

   * - .. container:: notification

          “‘Friend, give me the robe this very day!’ (Saying this,) he grabbed hold of him by the belt. So the lay follower, being pressured by Ven. Upananda the Sakyan, purchased a robe for him and came late. The people said to the lay follower, ‘Why, master, have you come late? You’ve lost 50!’ So he told them what had happened. They criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘They’re arrogant, these Sakyan-son monks, and malcontent. It’s no simple matter even to render them a service. How can Upananda the Sakyan, being told by a layman, “Wait for the rest of today, venerable sir,” not wait?’”

     - .. container:: notification

          「『朋友，今天就把衣給我吧！』（這麼說）他抓住了他的腰帶。因此，優婆塞受到了釋迦族優波難陀尊者的壓力，為他買了一件衣，但遲到了。人們對優婆塞說：『大德，你怎麼來晚了？你已經損失了 50 塊！』所以他告訴他們發生的事情。他們批評、抱怨、傳播：『這些釋迦子僧人太傲慢了，而且不知足。即使是為他們提供服務也不是一件簡單的事。釋迦族優波難陀在優婆塞的勸告下，「尊者，請稍等今日」，怎不能等呢？』」

   * - **Stewards**
     - **服務者**

   * - According to the Commentary, there are three types of steward with whom money might be placed: (1) indicated by the bhikkhu, (2) indicated by the donor or his/her messenger, and (3) indicated by neither.

     - 根據《義註》，可以放置金錢的服務者有三類：（1）由比丘指定，（2）由施主或其使者指定，以及（3）兩者都沒有指定。

   * - *1) Indicated by the bhikkhu* covers two sorts of cases:
     - *1) 比丘指定*\涵蓋兩種情況：

   * - a\) The donor asks the bhikkhu who his steward is, and the bhikkhu points him/her out, as mentioned in the training rule.
     - a\) 施主詢問比丘誰是他的服務者，比丘指出他/她，如學處所述。

   * - b\) The donor, knowing that a particular lay person has volunteered to act as a steward or is on familiar terms with the bhikkhu, gives the money to the lay person and informs the bhikkhu—or has someone else inform him—either before or after the fact.

     - b\) 施主知道某個在家人自願擔任服務者或與比丘關係熟悉時，將錢交給該在家人，並在之前或之後通知該比丘——或讓其他人通知他。

   * - *2) Indicated by the donor* covers cases where the donor chooses one of his/her own friends or employees to act as the steward for that particular gift, and informs the bhikkhu—or has someone else inform him—either before or after the fact.

     - *2）由施主指定*\，包括施主選擇他/她自己的一位朋友或僱員作為該特定布施的服務者，並在事前或事後通知比丘－或讓其他人通知他的情況。

   * - *3) Indicated by neither* covers two separate cases:
     - *3) 兩者都沒有指定*\涵蓋兩種不同的情況：

   * - a\) The donor asks the bhikkhu who his steward is, and the bhikkhu says that he has none. Another person happens to overhear the conversation and volunteers—in the presence of both—to act as the steward for that particular gift.

     - a\) 施主問比丘誰是他的服務者，比丘說他沒有。另一個人碰巧無意中聽到了談話，並在兩人都在場的情況下自願擔任該特定布施的服務者。

   * - b\) The donor gives the gift to the lay person who is normally the bhikkhu’s steward or is on familiar terms with the bhikkhu, but does not inform the bhikkhu or have him informed of the fact.

     - b\) 施主將該布施給在家人，通常是比丘的服務者或與比丘關係熟悉的人，但沒有通知比丘或讓他知道這一事實。

   * - According to the Commentary, this training rule covers only cases of the first sort—the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu—but not of the other two. This, however, is a controversial point. To understand the controversy, though, we will first have to discuss the protocols for accepting funds and obtaining requisites from stewards as set forth in this rule. Then we will revisit this issue in the section, “range of application,” below.

     - 根據《義註》，本學處只涵蓋第一種情況──服務者由比丘指定──而不包括其他兩種情況。然而，這是一個有爭議的觀點。不過，為了理解這項爭議，我們首先必須討論本戒條中規定的接受資金和從服務者那裡獲取必需品的行儀。然後我們將在下面的「適用範圍」部分中重新討論這個議題。

   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile

   * - **The protocol in accepting**
     - **接受的行儀**

   * - The Vibhaṅga gives the following guidelines:
     - 《經分別》給出了以下\ `指導方針 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0313a14>`__\：

   * - If donors offer money, they are to be told that bhikkhus do not accept money.
     - 如果布施者提供金錢，他們應該被告知比丘不接受金錢。

   * - If they ask who the bhikkhus’ steward is, one may point out any lay person at all, saying, “That’s the steward.” One is *not* to say, “Give it to him/her,” or “He/she will keep (the money),” for that would be to accept ownership and responsibility for the money, and thus be an infraction of the rule against accepting money. Also, one is not to say, “He/she will buy (the requisite),” or “He/she will get it in exchange,” for even this much would be an infraction of the rule against trading.

     - 如果他們問誰是比丘的服務者，可以指著任何一個在家人說：「那就是服務者。」 *不要*\說「把錢給他/她」或「他/她會保管（錢）」，因為那樣就等於接受了錢的所有權和責任，從而違反禁止接受金錢的戒條。此外，也不能說「他/她會購買（必需品）」或「他/她會得到它作為交換」，因為即使是這樣也將違反禁止交易的戒條。

   * - The K/Commentary adds that if the donor asks, “To whom should I give this?” or “Who will keep this?” one is not to point anyone out. It doesn’t say what one *may* do in such a situation, although a wise policy would be to broach the topic of stewards so that the donor will ask a question to which one may give an allowable answer.

     - K/《義註》補充說，如果布施者問：「我應該把這個給誰？」或「誰會保管這個？」不要指出任何人。它沒有說明在這種情況下\ *可以*\做什麼，儘管明智之舉是提出服務者的話題，以便布施者提出一個可以給出允許答案的問題。

   * - **The protocol in obtaining requisites from the fund**
     - **從資金取得必需品的行儀**

   * - The rule states that a bhikkhu may give his steward up to three verbal and six silent promptings in order to get a requisite from the fund. The Vibhaṅga works out an arrangement whereby he may exchange two silent promptings for one verbal prompting, which leads the Commentary to lay out the following scheme: A bhikkhu may make up to—

     - 戒條規定，比丘可以向他的服務者發出最多三次口頭提示和六次無聲提示，以便從資金中獲得必需品。《經分別》制定了一種安排，使他可以將\ `兩次無聲提示改為一次口頭提示 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0314a10>`__\，這導致《義註》提出以下方案：比丘可以做到——

   * - 6 verbal & 0 silent promptings
     - 6次 口頭 及 0次 無聲提示

   * - 5 verbal & 2 silent promptings
     - 5次 口頭 及 2次 無聲提示

   * - 4 verbal & 4 silent promptings
     - 4次 口頭 及 4次 無聲提示

   * - 3 verbal & 6 silent promptings
     - 3次 口頭 及 6次 無聲提示

   * - 2 verbal & 8 silent promptings
     - 2次 口頭 及 8次 無聲提示

   * - 1 verbal & 10 silent promptings, or
     - 1次 口頭 及 10次 無聲提示，或

   * - 0 verbal & 12 silent promptings
     - 0次 口頭 及 12次 無聲提示

   * - The Vibhaṅga adds that when giving a verbal prompting, one may say only, “I need a robe (or whatever the requisite may be),” or statements to that effect. One may not say, “Give me a robe,” “Get me a robe,” “Buy me a robe,” or “Get a robe in exchange for me,” for these last two statements in particular would incur a penalty under `NP 20`_.

     - 《經分別》\ `補充說，當給予口頭提示時 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0314a03>`__\，只能說：「我需要一件衣（或任何必要的東西）」，或類似的陳述。不能說，「給我一件衣」，「拿給我一件衣」，「買給我一件衣」，或者「交換一件衣給我」，因為最後兩種說法尤其會招致\ `《捨墮》二十`_\ 的懲罰。

   * - According to the Commentary, promptings are counted not by the number of visits to the steward but by the number of times the bhikkhu states his need/desire for the requisite. Thus if, in one visit, he states his need for a robe three times, that counts as three verbal promptings.

     - 根據《義註》，提示不是根據拜訪服務者的次數來計算的，而是根據比丘陳述他對必需品的需要/渴望的次數來計算的。因此，如果他在一次拜訪中三次表示需要一件衣，那就算是三次口頭提示。

   * - As for silent promptings—or “standings”—the bhikkhu merely stands in the steward’s presence. If the steward asks, “What have you come for?’ the bhikkhu should say, “You know,” or “You should know.”

     - 至於無聲提示——或「站立」——比丘只是站在服務者面前。如果服務者問：「你來做什麼？」比丘應該說：「你知道」或「你應該知道」。

   * - The Vibhaṅga also notes that during the period when a bhikkhu has yet to receive the requisite, he should not accept an invitation to sit down at the steward’s place, to accept alms, or to teach Dhamma there. If he does any of these things, that cuts back his number of allowed standings. The Sub-commentary raises the question as to what precisely this means: When a bhikkhu does several of these actions in one visit, does each action take away one standing, or is just that one visit struck from his allowed number of standings? After a long discussion, it sides with the decision in the Three Gaṇṭhipadas: Each time a bhikkhu sits, receives alms, or teaches one sentence of Dhamma (see `Pc 7`_) under these circumstances, even in one visit, he cuts down his allowed number of standings by one.

     - 《經分別》也指出，\ `在比丘尚未領受必需品期間，他不應接受坐在服務者處的邀請、接受施捨，或在那裡教導佛法。`_\ 如果他做了任何這些事情，就會減少他允許的站立次數。《複註》提出了一個問題，即這到底意味著什麼：當比丘在一次拜訪中做了數個這樣的行為時，是否每一個行為都會減少一個站立，或者只是那一次拜訪從他允許的站立次數中減去？經過冗長的討論，它支持《Three Gaṇṭhipada》中的決定：每當比丘在這種情況下坐著、接受施捨，或教導一句佛法（參見\ `《波逸提》七`_\）時，即使是一次拜訪，他也會在允許的站立次數中減去一次。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if one obtains the requisite after making the allowable number of verbal and silent promptings—or fewer—there is no offense. If one does not obtain the requisite after the maximum allowable number of promptings, one should inform the original donor and then leave the issue up to him/her. If the donor, being informed, then makes arrangements to get the requisite for the bhikkhu, there is no offense.

     - 《經分別》指出，如果在進行了允許次數的口頭和無聲提示（或更少）後獲得了必需的東西，那麼就沒有犯戒。如果在最大允許次數的提示後仍未獲得必需品，則應通知原始施主，然後將問題留給他/她。如果施主得知情況後，作出安排，為比丘取得必需品，這並沒有犯戒。

   * - The Commentary adds that not to inform the donor here entails a dukkaṭa on the grounds that one is neglecting a duty. This statement, however, should be qualified to apply only in cases where one knows which donor gave which fund to which steward. If a single fund administered by a steward contains donations from many donors, one is unlikely to be in a position to inform all the donors if the steward does not respond to one’s request. In such cases one should be duty bound to inform only one of the donors.

     - 《義註》補充說，不通知施主會犯《突吉羅》，理由是疏忽了職責。然而，這個說法僅適用於知道哪位施主向哪位服務者提供哪項資金的情況。如果服務者管理的單一資金包含許多施主的捐款，如果服務者不回應請求，則不太可能通知所有施主。在這種情況下，有義務只通知其中一位施主。

   * - **Range of application**
     - **適用範圍**

   * - As mentioned above, the Commentary maintains that this rule applies only in the first of the three cases listed there: The steward has been indicated by the bhikkhu. As for the second case—the steward has been indicated by the donor—it maintains that one may make any number of promptings without committing an offense. If the article is not forthcoming, one may get another lay person to handle the issue (although one should be careful to phrase one’s request to this lay person so as not to transgress the rules against accepting money or trading). If the article is not forthcoming, one is not duty-bound to inform the original donor. Although there is nothing in the Canon to contradict any of these points, there is nothing to confirm them, either. Simple etiquette would suggest that one not harass the steward excessively and that one should inform the donor if the article is not forthcoming, so as to let the donor decide what, if anything, should be done. Thus it would make sense, using the Great Standards, to apply this rule even in cases of this sort.

     - 如上所述，《義註》認為本戒條僅適用於所列三種情況中的第一種：服務者已由比丘指定。至於第二種情況──服務者已由施主指定──它認為可以做出任意次數的提示而不構成犯戒。如果沒有提供物品，可以找另一位居士來處理這個議題（儘管應該小心地向這位居士表達自己的請求，以免違反禁止接受金錢或交易的戒條）。如果沒有提供物品，則沒有義務通知原始施主。儘管《聖典》中沒有任何內容與這些觀點相矛盾，但也沒有任何內容可以證實它們。簡單的建議禮節是，不要過度騷擾服務者，如果沒有提供物品，應該通知施主，以便讓施主決定應該做什麼（如果有的話）。因此，即使在這種情況下，使用《四大教示》來適用本戒條也是有意義的。

   * - As for the third case, in which the steward is not indicated either by the donor or by a bhikkhu, the Commentary says that, as far as that fund is concerned, the steward should be treated as a person who is not related and has not made an invitation to ask. In other words, one may not make any requests of the steward at all unless he/she happens to invite one to make a request. The Commentary gives no reasons for these positions, and they are hard to infer. In the first of the two instances under this sub-category—the volunteer temporary steward—the Commentary depicts the steward as volunteering in the presence of both the bhikkhu and the donor, and this would seem to place the steward under some obligation to both. Thus the bhikkhu would seem to have the right to make a reasonable number of promptings; and the donor, the right to know if the article is not forthcoming.

     - 至於第三種情況，即施主或比丘均未指明服務者的情況，《義註》指出，就該資金而言，服務者應被視為無親屬關係且與尚未發出詢問邀請的人。換句話說，除非服務者碰巧邀請提出請求，否則根本不能向服務者提出任何要求。《義註》沒有給出這些立場的理由，很難推論。在這個子類別下的兩個例子中的第一個——志願臨時服務者——《義註》中將服務者描述為同時在比丘和施主面前做志願者，這似乎使服務者對雙方都負有某種義務。因此，比丘似乎有權做出合理次數的提示；而施主，則有權知道該物品是否被提供。

   * - As for the second of the two instances—the donor gives the gift to the bhikkhu’s normal steward but does not inform the bhikkhu or have him informed—the steward can either inform the bhikkhu or not. If he/she chooses to inform the bhikkhu, then according to the Commentary the bhikkhu would have the right to make any number of promptings, as the steward now counts as having given an invitation. Thus the steward would not be protected by the protocol under this rule, which doesn’t seem proper. If, however, the steward chooses not to inform the bhikkhu, there are two further possibilities: Either the bhikkhu never learns of the arrangement, in which case the issue is moot; or else he learns through a third party, in which case the bhikkhu would seem to have the right to ask the steward if the third party’s report is true. If the steward lies and says No, then that’s the steward’s kamma. If the steward truthfully reports Yes, then it would seem reasonable to apply the protocol under this rule.

     - 至於這兩種情況中的第二種情況──施主將布施給比丘的正常服務者，但沒有通知比丘或讓他被通知──服務者可以通知比丘，也可以不通知。如果他/她選擇通知比丘，那麼根據《義註》，比丘將有權做出任意次數的提示，因為服務者現在被視為已發出邀請。因此，根據本戒條，服務者將不受行儀的保護，這似乎不合適。然而，如果服務者選擇不通知比丘，則還有兩種可能性：要麽比丘永遠不知道這一安排，在這種情況下，這議題就沒有意義了；否則，他透過第三者得知，在這種情況下，比丘似乎有權詢問服務者第三者的報告是否屬實。如果服務者撒謊並說「不」，那麼這就是服務者的業力。如果服務者如實報告「是」，那麼適用本戒條下的行儀似乎是合理的。

   * - Thus, given these considerations, there would seem to be little reason to limit the protocols under this rule to cases where the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu, and stronger reason, using the Great Standards, to apply the protocols to all three cases: where the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu, by the donor, or by neither.

     - 因此，鑑於這些考慮，似乎沒有什麼理由將本戒條下的行儀限制於比丘指定服務者的情況，並且更有理由使用《四大教示》將行儀適用於所有三種情況：服務者由比丘、施主指定，或兩者都沒有指定。

   * - As we will note under `NP 18`_, a bank can serve as a steward for a bhikkhu. However, because of the protocols surrounding a bhikkhu’s relationship to his steward, he may not sign a check—which is an order to pay money to the order of the payee—even if the check draws on an account set up in his name. Nor may he present the bank with a withdrawal statement to remove money from the account.

     - 正如我們將在\ `《捨墮》一八`_\中指出的，銀行可以充當比丘的服務者。然而，由於比丘與服務者關係的行儀，即使支票是從以他的名義開設的帳戶中提取的，他不能簽署支票（這是按照收款人的指示付款的命令）。他也不得向銀行提供提款聲明以從帳戶中提取資金。
