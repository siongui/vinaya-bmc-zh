          *In case a king, a royal official, a brahman, or a householder sends a robe fund for the sake of a bhikkhu via a messenger, (saying,) “Having purchased a robe with this robe fund, clothe the bhikkhu named so-and-so with a robe”: If the messenger, approaching the bhikkhu, should say, “This is a robe fund being delivered for the sake of the venerable one. May the venerable one accept this robe fund,” then the bhikkhu is to tell the messenger: “We do not accept robe funds, my friend. We accept robes (robe-cloth) as are proper according to season.”*

          *若國王、王官、婆羅門、居士透過使者為比丘送衣資，（說：）「用此衣資購買衣後，送衣給某某比丘披著」：如果使者接近比丘時如此說：「這是為尊者而交付的衣資。願尊者接受此衣資。」然後，比丘要告訴使者：「我們不接受衣資，我的朋友。我們接受根據季節合適的衣（衣布料）。」*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If the messenger should say to the bhikkhu, “Does the venerable one have a steward?” then, bhikkhus, if the bhikkhu desires a robe, he may indicate a steward—either a monastery attendant or a lay follower—(saying,) “That, my friend, is the bhikkhus’ steward.”*

          *若使者對比丘如此說：「尊者有服務者嗎？」那麼，比丘們，如果比丘想要一件衣，他可以指示一位服務者——或者是寺院侍者，或者是在家人——（說：）「我的朋友，那是比丘的服務者。」*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If the messenger, having instructed the steward and going to the bhikkhu, should say, “I have instructed the steward the venerable one indicated. May the venerable one go (to him) and he will clothe you with a robe in season,” then the bhikkhu, desiring a robe and approaching the steward, may prompt and remind him two or three times, “I have need of a robe.” Should (the steward) produce the robe after being prompted and reminded two or three times, that is good.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果使者在交代了服務者之後，前往比丘那裡，如此說：「我已經交代了尊者所指示的服務者。願尊者前往，他會在適當的時候送衣給您披著。」然後，比丘想要衣，就到服務者那裡，可以催促、提醒他兩三遍：「我需要衣。」如果在兩、三次催促、提醒時獲得該衣，這實在很好。*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If he should not produce the robe, (the bhikkhu) should stand in silence four times, five times, six times at most for that purpose. Should (the steward) produce the robe after (the bhikkhu) has stood in silence for that purpose four, five, six times at most, that is good.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果沒有獲得，那麼（比丘）就應該默立四次、五次、至多六次。如果（服務者）在（比丘）為此目的而默立四次、五次、至多六次之後，獲得該衣，這實在很好*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *If he should not produce the robe (at that point), should he then produce the robe after (the bhikkhu) has endeavored further than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.*

          *假如沒有獲得衣（此時），如果在（比丘）更努力之後獲得衣，尼薩耆波逸提。*

          *If he should not produce (the robe), then the bhikkhu himself should go to the place from which the robe fund was brought, or a messenger should be sent (to say), “The robe fund that you, venerable sirs, sent for the sake of the bhikkhu has given no benefit to the bhikkhu at all. May you be united with what is yours. May what is yours not be lost.” This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果沒有獲得（衣），那麼比丘就應該親自到衣資帶來的地方，或者派一個使者（說）：「尊敬的先生們，你們曾指定為比丘所送去的衣資根本沒有給比丘帶來任何利益。願屬於你的回歸於你。願屬於你的不失去。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The protocols surrounding gifts of money and their proper use are quite complex—much more complex than even this long training rule would indicate—and require a detailed explanation. What follows is an attempt to make them clear. If it seems long and involved, remember that the purpose of the protocols is to free bhikkhus from the even more bothersome worries and complexities that come with participating in buying, selling, and monetary matters in general.

     - 圍繞金錢贈禮及其正確使用的行儀相當複雜——甚至比這個冗長的學處所表明的還要複雜得多——並且需要詳細的解釋。接下來是試著讓它們變得清晰。如果它看起來又長又複雜，請記住，這些行儀的目的是讓比丘擺脫參與一般買賣和貨幣事務所帶來的更麻煩的擔憂和複雜性。
