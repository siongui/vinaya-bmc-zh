          “Now at that time, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs became recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. (According to the Commentary, if a bhikkhu gave a good exhortation to the bhikkhunīs, they would tell their supporters, who in turn would provide the exhorter with requisites.) The thought occurred to some group-of-six bhikkhus: ‘At present, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs have become recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. Let’s exhort the bhikkhunīs, too.’ So, having approached the bhikkhunīs, they said, ‘Come, sisters, go to us too, and we’ll exhort you as well.’

          「\ `爾時 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0066a06>`__\ ，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。（根據《義註》，如果比丘善於教誡比丘尼，他們會告訴他們的支持者們，支持者們又會為教誡者提供生活必需品。）六群比丘想到：『目前，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。我們也教誡比丘尼吧。』於是，他們來到比丘尼跟前，說：『來，姊妹們，也到我們這裡來，我們也教誡你們。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “So the bhikkhunīs went to the group-of-six bhikkhus and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. Then the group-of-six bhikkhus, after giving just a trifling Dhamma talk and spending the day with animal talk, dismissed the bhikkhunīs: ‘You may go, sisters.’

          “Then the bhikkhunīs went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there, the Blessed One said to them: ‘I hope the exhortation was effective, bhikkhunīs.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「比丘尼們去世尊處，到達後，頂禮佛陀，立於一旁。當她們站立時，世尊對她們說：『比丘尼們，願此教誡有效。』

          「『大德，這教誡從何有效？那六群比丘只給我們講了些微不足道的佛法，在談了一整天的畜生論後，便遣散我們了。』」

   * - When Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, the Buddha’s aunt and stepmother, asked him to establish an order of bhikkhunīs, he did so on the condition that she and all future bhikkhunīs accept eight rules of respect *(garu-dhamma)*. (This term is sometimes translated as “heavy rules” or “important rules,” but the Commentary explains it as meaning vows that the bhikkhunīs are to accept with respect.) In short:

     - 當佛陀的姨母兼繼母\ `大愛道·瞿曇彌`_\ 請求佛陀建立一個比丘尼教團時，佛陀答應了，條件是\ `大愛道·瞿曇彌`_\ 和所有未來的比丘尼都必須接受\ `八敬法`_\ *（garu-dhamma）*\ 。（該詞有時被翻譯為「重戒」或「重要戒」，但《義註》將其解釋為比丘尼必須恭敬接受的誓言。）簡而言之：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          1\) Even a bhikkhunī who has been ordained over a century must pay homage to a bhikkhu ordained that very day.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          1）即使受具足戒超過百年的比丘尼，也必須頂禮當天受具足戒的比丘。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          2\) A bhikkhunī must not spend the Rains in a residence where there is no bhikkhu (within half a yojana, says the Commentary).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          2）比丘尼不得在沒有比丘的住所度過雨安居（《義註》中說，半\ `由旬`_\ 之內）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          3\) Every half month a bhikkhunī should expect two things from the Community of bhikkhus: permission to ask the date of the Pāṭimokkha recitation and permission to approach for an exhortation.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          3）每半個月，比丘尼應預期比丘僧團給予兩件事：允許詢問《波羅提木叉》誦戒的日期，以及允許至比丘尼處教誡。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          4\) At the end of the Rains-residence, every bhikkhunī should invite accusations both from the Community of bhikkhunīs and from the Community of bhikkhus.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          4）雨安居結束時，每個比丘尼都應該邀請比丘尼僧團和比丘僧團的指責。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          5\) A bhikkhunī who has broken any of the rules of respect must undergo penance *(mānatta)* for half a month under both Communities.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          5）違反任何一條敬法的比丘尼必須在二部僧團下接受半個月的\ `摩那埵`_\ *（mānatta）*\ 。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          6\) A woman may become ordained as a bhikkhunī only after, as a female trainee *(sikkhamānā)*, she has observed the first six of the ten precepts without lapse for two full years. (Apparently she did this as a ten-precept female novice, although this point is controversial.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          6）女人必須作為\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ *（sikkhamānā）*\ 持守十戒中的前六戒滿兩年且無間斷之後，方可受戒為比丘尼。（顯然她是在擔任十戒沙彌尼時這樣做的，儘管這一點存在爭議。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          7\) A bhikkhunī is not to insult or revile a bhikkhu in any way. According to the Commentary, this means that she is not to insult him with any of the ten *akkosa-vatthu* (see `Pc 2`_) or any other matter, nor is she to threaten him with harm.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          7）比丘尼不得出任何方式侮辱或辱罵比丘。根據《義註》，這意味著她不得用十種 *akkosa-vatthu* （見\ `《波逸提》二`_\ ）或任何其他事物侮辱他，也不得用傷害來威脅他。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          8\) A bhikkhunī may not instruct a bhikkhu, although a bhikkhu may instruct a bhikkhunī. (According to the Commentary, this means that a bhikkhunī may not give commands to a bhikkhu on how to behave. However, it notes, she may teach him in a more indirect manner, saying, for instance, “In the past, the great bhikkhus behaved like this.”)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          8）比丘尼不可以教導比丘，但比丘可以教導比丘尼。（根據《義註》，這意味著比丘尼不得命令比丘如何行為舉止。但是，它指出，她可以以更間接的方式教導他，例如說，「在過去，偉大的比丘們行為舉止像這樣。」）

   * - This rule deals with the biweekly exhortation mentioned in the third vow. The pattern for the exhortation was that once a bhikkhu had been chosen by the bhikkhus to exhort the bhikkhunīs, he was to sweep the place for the exhortation within the monastery where he was dwelling, set out water for drinking and washing, arrange seats for the bhikkhunīs, find a male companion, and then sit waiting for the bhikkhunīs to arrive. When they had come, he was to ask if all the bhikkhunīs were present and if the eight rules of respect were being kept up (§). (According to the Commentary, this last question means, “Are they kept memorized so that they are fresh in the memory?”) If they weren’t, he was to recite the eight rules. If they were, he was to present an exhortation.

     - 這條戒條涉及第三個誓言中提到的每兩週一次的教誡。教誡的模式是，當比丘們選定一位比丘來教誡比丘尼時，這位比丘要打掃自己所住寺院的教誡場所，擺上飲用水和洗用水，為比丘尼安排座位，找一位男伴，然後坐著等候比丘尼到來。當他們到來時，他要詢問所有比丘尼是否都在場，以及八敬法是否得到遵守（§）。（根據《義註》，最後一個問題的意思是「它們是否被記住了，以至於記憶猶新？」）如果沒有，他就必須背誦八敬法。如果是的話，他應該提出教誡。

   * - Because the eight rules form the heart of the exhortation, the two factors for the full offense under this rule are defined as follows:
     - 由於八敬法是教誡的核心，因此，根據本戒條構成完全違犯的兩個因素定義如下：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Object:* a bhikkhunī or group of bhikkhunīs.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）對象：*\ 一名比丘尼或一群比丘尼。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Effort:* A bhikkhu exhorts her/them concerning the eight rules of respect when he has neither been properly authorized to do so by the Community *nor* asked by the bhikkhunī(s) to give instruction.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）努力：*\ 當比丘沒有得到僧團的適當授權，\ *也沒有*\ 得到比丘尼的教導要求時，他便教誡她/她們關於八敬法。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - A bhikkhunī had to undergo a double ordination, first in the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha and then in the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, before she was considered fully ordained. Thus only a bhikkhunī with the full double ordination is grounds for a pācittiya here. A bhikkhunī who has received only her first ordination, from the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, is grounds for a dukkaṭa, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.

     - 比丘尼必須接受雙重受戒，先在比丘尼僧伽，然後在比丘僧伽，才算完整受戒。因此，只有完整雙重受戒的比丘尼才會在此構成《波逸提》。僅從比丘尼僧伽接受單部受戒的比丘尼，則構成《突吉羅》，而\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ 和沙彌尼則不構成犯戒。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - A bhikkhu, not properly authorized, who exhorts the bhikkhunīs on any topic other than the eight rules incurs a dukkaṭa.
     - 未經適當授權的比丘，若就八敬法以外的任何話題教誡比丘尼，犯《突吉羅》。

   * - **The authorization**
     - **授權**

   * - When this rule was still newly formulated, some group-of-six bhikkhus simply authorized one another to continue exhorting the bhikkhunīs. This forced the Buddha to establish stringent standards for the type of bhikkhu who could properly be authorized. They were, in short:

     - 當這條戒條剛剛制定時，六群比丘只是互相授權繼續教誡比丘尼。這迫使佛陀對能夠獲得適當授權的比丘類型制定了嚴格的標準。簡而言之，它們是：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is scrupulously virtuous.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他戒行一絲不苟。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is very learned and thoroughly understands the teachings of the celibate life.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他學識淵博，並透徹理解梵行生活的教義。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has mastered both the bhikkhus’ Pāṭimokkha and the bhikkhunīs’ Pāṭimokkha.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他已精通比丘《波羅提木叉》與比丘尼的《波羅提木叉》。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has a pleasing voice and delivery.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他的聲音和表達方式令人愉悅。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is well-liked by most of the bhikkhunīs. (As the Commentary notes, this means that he is liked by the bhikkhunīs who are learned, virtuous, and wise.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他深受大多數比丘尼的喜愛。（如《義註》所言，這意味著他受到有學問、有戒行、有智慧的比丘尼們的喜愛。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is capable of exhorting the bhikkhunīs. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he is able to cite sutta passages and other reasons that will instill within the bhikkhunīs a sense of the dangers in the cycle of rebirth.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他有能力教誡比丘尼。（根據《義註》，這意味著他能夠引用經文和其他理由，讓比丘尼們意識到輪迴的危險。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He never, before his ordination, violated an important rule against one wearing the ochre robe. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he never engaged in bodily contact with a bhikkhunī or in sexual intercourse with a female trainee or female novice).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          在他受具足戒之前，他從未違反過對穿赭色袈裟者的重要戒條。（根據《義註》，這意味著他從未與比丘尼發生過身體接觸，也從未與\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ 或沙彌尼發生過性交）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has been a bhikkhu for at least 20 years.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他當比丘至少20年。

   * - With regard to the first of these qualifications, `Cv.II.1.2`_ notes that a bhikkhu undergoing penance or probation for a saṅghādisesa offense should not accept an authorization to exhort the bhikkhunīs; even if authorized, he should not exhort them. The same restriction applies to bhikkhus undergoing the duties imposed by a transaction of censure, further punishment, demotion, banishment, suspension, or reconciliation. (See `BMC2, Chapter 20`_. For more details on the authorization procedures, see `BMC2, Chapter 23`_.)

     - 關於第一個資格，\ `《小品》.二.1.2`_ 指出，因犯《僧殘》罪而接受摩那埵或別住的比丘不應接受教誡比丘尼的授權；即使獲得授權，他也不應該教誡她們。同樣的限制也適用於因受到呵責、罪處所、依止、驅出、舉罪或下意羯磨而履行義務的比丘。（請參閱\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十章`_\ 。有關授權程序的更多詳細信息，請參閱\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十三章`_\ 。）

   * - As the Commentary notes, the group-of-six bhikkhus never possessed the above eight qualities even in their dreams.
     - 正如《義註》所指出的，這六群比丘即使在夢中也從未具備上述八種特質。

   * - One’s perception as to whether one was properly authorized is not a factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 對於自己是否獲得適當授權的感知在這裡並不是一個因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - Although this rule grew from a time when bhikkhus were eager to exhort the bhikkhunīs, times changed. The Cullavagga (`Cv.X.9.5`_) deals with a period when the bhikkhus tried to avoid exhorting the bhikkhunīs, and `Cv.X.9.4`_ tells what should be done when there is no bhikkhu qualified to exhort them. (The bhikkhus were to tell them, “Strive for completion (in the practice) in an amicable way.”)

     - 雖然這條戒條源自於比丘們熱衷於教誡比丘尼的時代，但時代變了。《小品》（\ `《小品》.十.9.5`_\ ）講述了比丘們試圖避免教誡比丘尼的時期，而\ `《小品》.十.9.4`_ 則講述了當沒有比丘有資格教誡她們時應該怎麼做。（比丘們應該告訴她們：「以友善的方式努力完成（修行）。」）

   * - Even in these cases, though, the bhikkhunīs were not left adrift. They could approach any bhikkhu they admired and ask him for instruction. Thus the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clauses here say, “There is no offense when, having given the exposition, having given the interrogation, and then, after being requested by the bhikkhunīs to recite, he recites.” According to the Commentary, “exposition” here means a recitation of the eight rules in Pali, whereas “interrogation” means the ancient commentary on the eight rules. This last is hardly likely. What seems more likely is that “exposition” means establishing that the bhikkhunīs have all come; “interrogation,” questioning them as to whether they have memorized the eight rules. At any rate, the Commentary goes on to say that, when a bhikkhu has been invited like this, he is free to speak about the eight rules or any other Dhamma topic without offense. Again, this seems unlikely, for the Vibhaṅga is very precise in the terminology it uses for the various stages leading up to the exhortation, and *recites (osāreti)* is not the verb it uses for speaking about a topic. Instead, it usually means repeating a passage from memory.

     - 但即使在這些情況下，比丘尼也並非無所適從。他們可以接近任何她們敬佩的比丘，並向他請教。因此，《經分別》中的不犯條款在此說：「在講解、詢問之後，然後在比丘尼要求誦讀之後，他誦讀，則無犯。」根據《義註》，「講解」在此指誦讀巴利語的八敬法，而「詢問」指古代對八敬法的註釋。最後這個不太可能。更有可能的是，「講解」是指確定比丘尼都已到場；「詢問」是指詢問她們是否已記住八敬法。無論如何，《義註》繼續說道，當一位比丘受到這樣的邀請時，他可以自由地談論八敬法或任何其他佛法話題，而不犯戒。再一次，這似乎不太可能，因為《經分別》在描述教誡的各個階段時使用的術語非常精確，而\ *「誦讀」（osāreti）*\ 並非它用來表示談論某個主題的動詞。它通常指的是憑記憶複述一段話。

   * - However, there is a non-offense clause in the Vibhaṅga that allows for an unauthorized bhikkhu to exhort a bhikkhunī (or bhikkhunīs) on the eight rules or any other topic in the following situation: if, being asked a question by a bhikkhunī, one answers her question. There is also no offense if a bhikkhunī happens to overhear any instruction one is giving for the sake of another person.

     - 然而，《經分別》中有一個不犯條款，允許未經授權的比丘在以下情況下就八敬法或其他任何話題教誡比丘尼：如果比丘尼提出問題，而比丘回答了她的問題。如果比丘尼偶然聽到比丘為他人所做的指導，也不構成犯戒。

   * - **Subsidiary rules**
     - **附屬戒條**

   * - The Vibhaṅga to this rule includes a discussion of three subsidiary rules related to the exhortation of the bhikkhunīs:
     - 此戒條的《經分別》包含了與教誡比丘尼有關的三條附屬戒條的討論：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          1\) A bhikkhu, even if authorized, incurs a dukkaṭa if he exhorts an incomplete group of bhikkhunīs, regardless of whether he perceives them as complete or not. The Sub-commentary notes, however, that according to the Vibhaṅga to the bhikkhunīs’ `Pc 58`_ an ill bhikkhunī is not obliged to go to an exhortation. Thus if all the bhikkhunīs except the ill ones have come, the group counts as complete. If the group is complete and yet the bhikkhu perceives it as incomplete or is in doubt, then if he still goes ahead with the exhortation he incurs a dukkaṭa.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          1）即使獲得授權，比丘如果教誡一群不完整的比丘尼，無論他認為這些比丘尼是否完整，都犯《突吉羅》。然而，《複註》指出，根據\ `比丘尼《波逸提》五八的《經分別》`_\ ，患病的比丘尼沒有義務參加教誡。因此，如果除了患病的比丘尼之外的所有比丘尼都已到場，則該群體就算完整。如果群體完整，但比丘認為其不完整或心存疑慮，而如果他仍然繼續教誡，則犯《突吉羅》。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          2\) If an authorized bhikkhu, after asking the bhikkhunīs if they have all come, speaks of another Dhamma (instead of asking them if the eight rules have been memorized), he incurs a dukkaṭa.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          2）如果一位已獲授權的比丘在詢問比丘尼們是否都已經到了之後，談論別種佛法（而不是詢問她們是否已經記住了八敬法），那麼他犯《突吉羅》。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          3\) If, without having first introduced the exhortation, he speaks of another Dhamma, he incurs a dukkaṭa. According to the Commentary, “introducing” an exhortation means simply announcing, “This, sisters, is the exhortation.” (See the origin story to the following rule for an example of this practice.) In other words, the dukkaṭa here is for simply launching into a talk without observing the proper formalities.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          3）如果未先引言教誡，就談論其他佛法，則犯《突吉羅》。根據《義註》，「引言」教誡的意思是簡單地宣布：「姊妹們，這是教誡。」（有關此做法的例子，請參閱\ `下一條戒條的起源故事`_\ 。）換句話說，此處的《突吉羅》是指未遵循適當的禮節而直接開始談話。

   * - *Summary: Exhorting a bhikkhunī about the eight rules of respect—except when one has been authorized to do so by the Community or asked a question by a bhikkhunī—is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：教誡比丘尼關於八敬法 —— 除非獲得僧團的授權如此做或被比丘尼詢問 —— 是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*
