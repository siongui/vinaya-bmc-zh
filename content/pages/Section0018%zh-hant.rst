          “Now at that time, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs became recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. (According to the Commentary, if a bhikkhu gave a good exhortation to the bhikkhunīs, they would tell their supporters, who in turn would provide the exhorter with requisites.) The thought occurred to some group-of-six bhikkhus: ‘At present, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs have become recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. Let’s exhort the bhikkhunīs, too.’ So, having approached the bhikkhunīs, they said, ‘Come, sisters, go to us too, and we’ll exhort you as well.’

          「\ `爾時 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0066a06>`__\ ，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。（根據《義註》，如果比丘善於教誡比丘尼，他們會告訴他們的支持者們，支持者們又會為教誡者提供生活必需品。）六群比丘想到：『目前，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。我們也教誡比丘尼吧。』於是，他們來到比丘尼跟前，說：『來，姊妹們，也到我們這裡來，我們也教誡你們。』

          “So the bhikkhunīs went to the group-of-six bhikkhus and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. Then the group-of-six bhikkhus, after giving just a trifling Dhamma talk and spending the day with animal talk, dismissed the bhikkhunīs: ‘You may go, sisters.’

          「於是比丘尼們來到六群比丘處，一到便頂禮，坐於一旁。六群比丘們只是開示了些微不足道的佛法，談了一整天的畜生論，便遣散了比丘尼們：『姐妹們，你們可以走了。』

          “Then the bhikkhunīs went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there, the Blessed One said to them: ‘I hope the exhortation was effective, bhikkhunīs.’

          「『大德，這教誡從何有效？那六群比丘只給我們講了些微不足道的佛法，在談了一整天的畜生論後，便遣散我們了。』」
