          “Now at that time, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs became recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. (According to the Commentary, if a bhikkhu gave a good exhortation to the bhikkhunīs, they would tell their supporters, who in turn would provide the exhorter with requisites.) The thought occurred to some group-of-six bhikkhus: ‘At present, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhunīs have become recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. Let’s exhort the bhikkhunīs, too.’ So, having approached the bhikkhunīs, they said, ‘Come, sisters, go to us too, and we’ll exhort you as well.’

          「\ `爾時 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0066a06>`__\ ，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。（根據《義註》，如果比丘善於教誡比丘尼，他們會告訴他們的支持者們，支持者們又會為教誡者提供生活必需品。）六群比丘想到：『目前，教誡比丘尼的長老比丘們，得到了袈裟、缽食、住處和病藥。我們也教誡比丘尼吧。』於是，他們來到比丘尼跟前，說：『來，姊妹們，也到我們這裡來，我們也教誡你們。』

          “So the bhikkhunīs went to the group-of-six bhikkhus and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. Then the group-of-six bhikkhus, after giving just a trifling Dhamma talk and spending the day with animal talk, dismissed the bhikkhunīs: ‘You may go, sisters.’

          「於是比丘尼們來到六群比丘處，一到便頂禮，坐於一旁。六群比丘們只是開示了些微不足道的佛法，談了一整天的畜生論，便遣散了比丘尼們：『姐妹們，你們可以走了。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then the bhikkhunīs went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there, the Blessed One said to them: ‘I hope the exhortation was effective, bhikkhunīs.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「比丘尼們去世尊處，到達後，頂禮佛陀，立於一旁。當她們站立時，世尊對她們說：『比丘尼們，願此教誡有效。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘Venerable sir, from where would the exhortation be effective? The group-of-six bhikkhus, giving just a trifling Dhamma talk, dismissed us after spending the day with animal talk.’”

          「『大德，這教誡從何有效？那六群比丘只給我們講了些微不足道的佛法，在談了一整天的畜生論後，便遣散我們了。』」

   * - When Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, the Buddha’s aunt and stepmother, asked him to establish an order of bhikkhunīs, he did so on the condition that she and all future bhikkhunīs accept eight rules of respect *(garu-dhamma)*. (This term is sometimes translated as “heavy rules” or “important rules,” but the Commentary explains it as meaning vows that the bhikkhunīs are to accept with respect.) In short:

     - 當佛陀的姨母兼繼母\ `大愛道·瞿曇彌`_\ 請求佛陀建立一個比丘尼教團時，佛陀答應了，條件是\ `大愛道·瞿曇彌`_\ 和所有未來的比丘尼都必須接受\ `八敬法`_\ *（garu-dhamma）*\ 。（該詞有時被翻譯為「重戒」或「重要戒」，但《義註》將其解釋為比丘尼必須恭敬接受的誓言。）簡而言之：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          1\) Even a bhikkhunī who has been ordained over a century must pay homage to a bhikkhu ordained that very day.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          1）即使受具足戒超過百年的比丘尼，也必須頂禮當天受具足戒的比丘。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          2\) A bhikkhunī must not spend the Rains in a residence where there is no bhikkhu (within half a yojana, says the Commentary).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          2）比丘尼不得在沒有比丘的住所度過雨安居（《義註》中說，半\ `由旬`_\ 之內）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          3\) Every half month a bhikkhunī should expect two things from the Community of bhikkhus: permission to ask the date of the Pāṭimokkha recitation and permission to approach for an exhortation.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          3）每半個月，比丘尼應預期比丘僧團給予兩件事：允許詢問《波羅提木叉》誦戒的日期，以及允許至比丘尼處教誡。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          4\) At the end of the Rains-residence, every bhikkhunī should invite accusations both from the Community of bhikkhunīs and from the Community of bhikkhus.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          4）雨安居結束時，每個比丘尼都應該邀請比丘尼僧團和比丘僧團的指責。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          5\) A bhikkhunī who has broken any of the rules of respect must undergo penance *(mānatta)* for half a month under both Communities.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          5）違反任何一條敬法的比丘尼必須在二部僧團下接受半個月的\ `摩那埵`_\ *（mānatta）*\ 。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          6\) A woman may become ordained as a bhikkhunī only after, as a female trainee *(sikkhamānā)*, she has observed the first six of the ten precepts without lapse for two full years. (Apparently she did this as a ten-precept female novice, although this point is controversial.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          6）女人必須作為\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ *（sikkhamānā）*\ 持守十戒中的前六戒滿兩年且無間斷之後，方可受戒為比丘尼。（顯然她是在擔任十戒沙彌尼時這樣做的，儘管這一點存在爭議。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          7\) A bhikkhunī is not to insult or revile a bhikkhu in any way. According to the Commentary, this means that she is not to insult him with any of the ten *akkosa-vatthu* (see `Pc 2`_) or any other matter, nor is she to threaten him with harm.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          7）比丘尼不得出任何方式侮辱或辱罵比丘。根據《義註》，這意味著她不得用十種 *akkosa-vatthu* （見\ `《波逸提》二`_\ ）或任何其他事物侮辱他，也不得用傷害來威脅他。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          8\) A bhikkhunī may not instruct a bhikkhu, although a bhikkhu may instruct a bhikkhunī. (According to the Commentary, this means that a bhikkhunī may not give commands to a bhikkhu on how to behave. However, it notes, she may teach him in a more indirect manner, saying, for instance, “In the past, the great bhikkhus behaved like this.”)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          8）比丘尼不可以教導比丘，但比丘可以教導比丘尼。（根據《義註》，這意味著比丘尼不得命令比丘如何行為舉止。但是，它指出，她可以以更間接的方式教導他，例如說，「在過去，偉大的比丘們行為舉止像這樣。」）

   * - This rule deals with the biweekly exhortation mentioned in the third vow. The pattern for the exhortation was that once a bhikkhu had been chosen by the bhikkhus to exhort the bhikkhunīs, he was to sweep the place for the exhortation within the monastery where he was dwelling, set out water for drinking and washing, arrange seats for the bhikkhunīs, find a male companion, and then sit waiting for the bhikkhunīs to arrive. When they had come, he was to ask if all the bhikkhunīs were present and if the eight rules of respect were being kept up (§). (According to the Commentary, this last question means, “Are they kept memorized so that they are fresh in the memory?”) If they weren’t, he was to recite the eight rules. If they were, he was to present an exhortation.

     - 這條戒條涉及第三個誓言中提到的每兩週一次的教誡。教誡的模式是，當比丘們選定一位比丘來教誡比丘尼時，這位比丘要打掃自己所住寺院的教誡場所，擺上飲用水和洗用水，為比丘尼安排座位，找一位男伴，然後坐著等候比丘尼到來。當他們到來時，他要詢問所有比丘尼是否都在場，以及八敬法是否得到遵守（§）。（根據《義註》，最後一個問題的意思是「它們是否被記住了，以至於記憶猶新？」）如果沒有，他就必須背誦八敬法。如果是的話，他應該提出教誡。

   * - Because the eight rules form the heart of the exhortation, the two factors for the full offense under this rule are defined as follows:
     - 由於八敬法是教誡的核心，因此，根據本戒條構成完全違犯的兩個因素定義如下：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Object:* a bhikkhunī or group of bhikkhunīs.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）對象：*\ 一名比丘尼或一群比丘尼。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Effort:* A bhikkhu exhorts her/them concerning the eight rules of respect when he has neither been properly authorized to do so by the Community *nor* asked by the bhikkhunī(s) to give instruction.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）努力：*\ 當比丘沒有得到僧團的適當授權，\ *也沒有*\ 得到比丘尼的教導要求時，他便教誡她/她們關於八敬法。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - A bhikkhunī had to undergo a double ordination, first in the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha and then in the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, before she was considered fully ordained. Thus only a bhikkhunī with the full double ordination is grounds for a pācittiya here. A bhikkhunī who has received only her first ordination, from the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, is grounds for a dukkaṭa, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.

     - 比丘尼必須接受雙重受戒，先在比丘尼僧伽，然後在比丘僧伽，才算完整受戒。因此，只有完整雙重受戒的比丘尼才會在此構成《波逸提》。僅從比丘尼僧伽接受單部受戒的比丘尼，則構成《突吉羅》，而\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ 和沙彌尼則不構成犯戒。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - A bhikkhu, not properly authorized, who exhorts the bhikkhunīs on any topic other than the eight rules incurs a dukkaṭa.
     - 未經適當授權的比丘，若就八敬法以外的任何話題教誡比丘尼，犯《突吉羅》。

   * - **The authorization**
     - **授權**

   * - When this rule was still newly formulated, some group-of-six bhikkhus simply authorized one another to continue exhorting the bhikkhunīs. This forced the Buddha to establish stringent standards for the type of bhikkhu who could properly be authorized. They were, in short:

     - 當這條戒條剛剛制定時，六群比丘只是互相授權繼續教誡比丘尼。這迫使佛陀對能夠獲得適當授權的比丘類型制定了嚴格的標準。簡而言之，它們是：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is scrupulously virtuous.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他戒行一絲不苟。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is very learned and thoroughly understands the teachings of the celibate life.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他學識淵博，並透徹理解梵行生活的教義。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has mastered both the bhikkhus’ Pāṭimokkha and the bhikkhunīs’ Pāṭimokkha.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他已精通比丘《波羅提木叉》與比丘尼的《波羅提木叉》。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has a pleasing voice and delivery.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他的聲音和表達方式令人愉悅。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is well-liked by most of the bhikkhunīs. (As the Commentary notes, this means that he is liked by the bhikkhunīs who are learned, virtuous, and wise.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他深受大多數比丘尼的喜愛。（如《義註》所言，這意味著他受到有學問、有戒行、有智慧的比丘尼們的喜愛。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He is capable of exhorting the bhikkhunīs. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he is able to cite sutta passages and other reasons that will instill within the bhikkhunīs a sense of the dangers in the cycle of rebirth.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他有能力教誡比丘尼。（根據《義註》，這意味著他能夠引用經文和其他理由，讓比丘尼們意識到輪迴的危險。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He never, before his ordination, violated an important rule against one wearing the ochre robe. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he never engaged in bodily contact with a bhikkhunī or in sexual intercourse with a female trainee or female novice).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          在他受具足戒之前，他從未違反過對穿赭色袈裟者的重要戒條。（根據《義註》，這意味著他從未與比丘尼發生過身體接觸，也從未與\ `學法女（式叉摩那）`_\ 或沙彌尼發生過性交）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          He has been a bhikkhu for at least 20 years.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          他當比丘至少20年。
