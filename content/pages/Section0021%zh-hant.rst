          “Then Ven. Sāgata went to the hermitage of the coiled-hair ascetic of Ambatittha, and on arrival—having entered the fire building and arranged a grass mat—sat down cross-legged with his body erect and mindfulness to the fore. The nāga (living in the fire building) saw that Ven. Sāgata had entered and, on seeing him, was upset, disgruntled, and emitted smoke. Ven. Sāgata emitted smoke. The nāga, unable to bear his rage, blazed up. Ven. Sāgata, entering the fire element, blazed up. Then Ven. Sāgata, having consumed the nāga’s fire with his own fire, left for Bhaddavatikā.

          “Then the Kosambī lay followers, having prepared pigeon’s liquor in house after house, and seeing that Ven.

          （§—泰國版和斯里蘭卡版的《聖典》拼讀為 *deḍḍubhena-pi* 。）

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - *Alcohol* means any alcoholic beverage made from grain, yeast, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include whiskey, beer, vodka, and gin. *Fermented liquor* means any alcoholic beverage made from flowers, fruits, honey, sugar, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include wine, mead, and rum. Together, the two terms are meant to cover all kinds of alcoholic beverages.

     - *酒精*\ 是指任何由穀物、酵母或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括威士忌、啤酒、伏特加和金酒。\ *發酵酒*\ 是指任何由花、水果、蜂蜜、糖或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括葡萄酒、蜂蜜酒和蘭姆酒。這兩個術語合在一起，旨在涵蓋所有種類的酒精飲料。

   * - There is some controversy as to what other substances would be included in this factor in line with the Great Standards. Because the Canon repeatedly criticizes alcohol on the grounds that it destroys one’s sense of shame, weakens one’s discernment, and can put one into a stupor—as happened to Ven. Sāgata—it seems reasonable to extend this rule to other intoxicants, narcotics, and hallucinogens as well. Thus things like marijuana, hashish, heroin, cocaine, and LSD would fulfill this factor. Coffee, tea, tobacco, and betel do not have this effect, though, so there is no reason to include them here.

     - 關於哪些其他物質符合《四大教示》，也應納入此因素，存在一些爭議。由於《聖典》一再批評酒精，認為它會損害人的羞恥感，削弱人的辨識力，並可能使人神智不清——就像娑伽陀尊者所遭遇的那樣——因此，將這一戒條擴展到其他麻醉品、麻醉劑和致幻劑似乎也合情合理。因此，大麻、大麻樹脂、海洛因、古柯鹼和迷幻藥（LSD）等東西符合此因素。然而，咖啡、茶、菸草和檳榔不具有這種效果，因此沒有理由將它們納入此處。

   * - Perception as to whether a liquid counts as alcohol or liquor is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_). Thus a bhikkhu drinking champagne that he thinks to be carbonated apple juice *would* fall under this factor, regardless of his ignorance.

     - 對於某種液體是否屬於酒精或含酒精飲料的感知，並非此處的減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。因此，如果一位比丘喝了他認為是碳酸蘋果汁的香檳，那麼無論他是否無知，\ *都*\ 符合這一因素。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *drinking* as taking even as little as the tip of a blade of grass. Thus taking a small glass of wine, even though it might not be enough to make one drunk, would be more than enough to fulfill this factor.

     - 《經分別》將\ *飲用*\ 定義為哪怕只喝一小片草尖。因此，喝一小杯酒，即使不足以讓人醉，也足以滿足這項條件。

   * - The Vibhaṅga does not, however, indicate how offenses are to be counted here. According to the Commentary, the number of offenses involved in taking an alcoholic drink is determined by the number of separate sips. As for intoxicants taken by means other than sipping, each separate effort would count as an offense.

     - 然而，《經分別》並未指明此處如何計算犯戒次數。根據《義註》，飲酒的犯戒次數取決於單獨啜飲的次數。至於以啜飲以外的方式使用麻醉品，每次單獨努力都算作一次犯戒。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense in taking items that are non-alcoholic, but whose color, taste, or smell is like alcohol. Thus, for example, carbonated apple juice that resembles champagne would not be grounds for an offense.

     - 《經分別》規定，飲用不含酒精但顏色、味道或氣味類似酒精的飲品並不構成犯戒。例如，類似香檳的碳酸蘋果汁不構成犯戒。

   * - There is also no offense in taking alcohol “cooked in broth, meat, or oil.” The Commentary interprets the first two items as referring to sauces, stews, and meat dishes to which alcoholic beverages, such as wine, are added for flavoring before they are cooked. Because the alcohol would evaporate during the cooking, it would have no intoxicating effect. Foods containing unevaporated alcohol—such as rum babas—would not be included under this allowance.

     - 飲用「用肉湯、肉或油烹調的」酒類也不犯戒。《義註》將前兩項解釋為醬汁、燉菜和肉類菜餚，在烹飪前會加入諸如葡萄酒等酒精飲料調味。由於酒精會在烹調過程中揮發，因此不會產生醉人效果。含有未揮發酒精的食物（例如蘭姆巴巴）不在此開緣之列。

   * - As for alcohol cooked in oil, this refers to a medicine used in the Buddha’s time for afflictions of the “wind element.” The Mahāvagga (VI.14.1) allows this medicine for internal use only as long as the taste, color, and smell of the alcohol are not perceptible. From this point, the Vinaya-mukha argues that morphine and other narcotics used as pain killers are allowable as well.

     - 至於油裡煮的酒，指的是佛陀時代用來治療「風大」不調的藥物。\ `《大品》（六.14.1）`_\ 規定，這種藥物只能內服，但酒的味道、顏色和氣味必須無法察覺。從這一點來看，《戒律入口》認為嗎啡和其他用於止痛的麻醉劑也是可以允許的。

   * - In addition, the non-offense clauses state, “With regard to molasses and emblic myrobalan, (there is no offense) if he drinks unfermented *ariṭṭha*.” The Commentary explains this as follows: “There is no offense for non-alcoholic *ariṭṭha*. They reportedly make ariṭṭha with the juice of such fruits as emblic myrobalan, which has the color, smell, and taste of alcohol but is not alcoholic: This is what is meant. That which has the starter thrown in, however, is alcoholic, and even the mother (of this kind of *ariṭṭha*) is unallowable.”

     - 此外，不犯條款規定：「至於糖蜜和餘甘子，如果他飲用未發酵的 *ariṭṭha* ，（不犯戒）。」《義註》對此解釋如下：「不含酒精的 *ariṭṭha* 不犯戒。據說他們用諸如餘甘子等水果的汁液製作 ariṭṭha ，有酒的顏色、氣味和味道，但不含酒精：這就是它的意思。然而，加入發酵劑者含有酒精，即使（這種 *ariṭṭha* 的）母體也是不允許的。」

   * - *Summary: Taking an intoxicant is a pācittiya offense regardless of whether one is aware that it is an intoxicant.*
     - *摘要：服用麻醉物是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪，無論是否知道它是麻醉物。*

   * - There are three factors for the full offense here.
     - 這裡的完全違犯有三個因素。

   * - *1) Object:* another bhikkhu.
     - *1）對象：*\ 另一位比丘。

   * - *2) Effort:* One touches any part of his body with any part of one’s own body
     - *2）努力：*\ 用自己身體的任何部位觸碰他的身體的任何部位

   * - *3) Intention:* for fun.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 為了好玩。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - A bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya here; any unordained person, grounds for a dukkaṭa. The Vibhaṅga does not say whether *unordained* here includes bhikkhunīs. The Commentary states explicitly that it does, adding that a bhikkhu looking for a little fun can tickle a bhikkhunī without incurring a penalty stronger than a dukkaṭa. There are occasional attempts at humor in the Commentary, and we can probably write this off as one of them.

     - 比丘在此構成《波逸提》；任何未受具足戒者，構成《突吉羅》。《經分別》並未說此處的\ *未受具足戒*\ 是否包括比丘尼。《義註》明確指出，包括比丘尼，並補充說，想找點樂子的比丘可以搔比丘尼癢，而不會遭受比《突吉羅》更重的懲罰。《義註》中偶爾會有一些幽默的嘗試，我們或許可以把這算作其中之一。

   * - Perception as to whether the person being tickled is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).
     - 被搔癢的人是否受過具足戒的感知與犯戒無關（參閱\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**

   * - This factor is fulfilled only by body-to-body contact, as defined at length under `Sg 2`_. The following actions, if done with the intent of making the other person laugh, would be grounds for a dukkaṭa here regardless of whether the person was ordained or not:

     - 這一因素僅透過身體對身體的接觸才能滿足，如\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 中詳細定義的那樣。如果以逗別人笑為目的而做出以下行為，則無論該人是否受具足戒，在此都構成《突吉羅》：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          using an item connected with the body—such as a stick—to poke at the person;

   * - **Intention**

   * - If one has legitimate motives for touching the other person aside from a desire for fun, there is no penalty in doing so. Thus a bhikkhu massaging another bhikkhu’s tired back commits no offense if he inadvertently happens to touch a spot where the other bhikkhu is ticklish. However, touching another bhikkhu in anger would come under `Pc 74`_.

     - 如果除了為了好玩之外，有正當動機觸碰他人，則這樣做不會受到任何懲罰。例如，一位比丘在按摩另一位比丘疲憊的背部時，如果無意中觸碰到了另一位比丘怕癢的部位，則不構成犯戒。然而，憤怒地觸碰另一位比丘則算在\ `《波逸提》七四`_\ 。

          *在水中玩耍的行為，波逸提。*

   * - Here again, the factors for the full offense are three.
     - 此處再次，構成完全違犯的因素有三。

   * - *1) Effort:* One jumps up or down, splashes, or swims
     - *1）努力：*\ 跳起或跳下、濺起水花或游泳

   * - *2) Object:* in water deep enough to immerse one’s ankle
     - *2）對象：*\ 水深足以浸沒腳踝

   * - *3) Intention:* for fun.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 為了好玩。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga is silent on how to count offenses under this rule. According to the Commentary, each individual effort counts as a separate offense. Thus if one is swimming for fun, one incurs a pācittiya for each hand or foot stroke.

     - 《經分別》並沒有說明如何根據這條戒條計算犯戒。根據《義註》，每一次單獨的努力都算作一次單獨的犯戒。因此，如果只是為了好玩而游泳，那麼每次划手或划腳都犯一次《波逸提》。

   * - Perception as to whether one’s actions count as “playing in the water” is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 關於自己的行為是否算作「在水中玩耍」的感知在這裡並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - Jumping up or down in water less than ankle deep entails a dukkaṭa, as does splashing water with the hands, feet, a stick, or a piece of tile; or playing with water or other liquids—such as rice gruel, milk, buttermilk, colored dyes, urine, or mud—in a vessel.

     - 在水深不到腳踝的水中跳上跳下犯《突吉羅》，用手、腳、棍子或瓷磚濺起水花也一樣；或玩在容器中的水或其他液體（如米粥、牛奶、酪乳、彩色染料、尿液或泥漿）。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that there is also a dukkaṭa for playing in a boat. This the Commentary illustrates with examples: such things as paddling a boat with an oar, propelling it with a pole, or pushing it up on shore. At present, sailing a sailboat or steering a motorboat would come under this factor.

     - 《經分別》指出，在船上玩耍也犯《突吉羅》。《義註》舉例說明了這一點：例如用槳划船、用篙撐船、或將船推上岸。目前，駕駛帆船或駕駛摩托艇都算在此因素之下。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines this factor as “for a laugh” *(hassādhippāyo)*, which the Commentary translates as “for fun” or “for sport” *(kiḷādhippāyo)*.
     - 《經分別》將此因素定義為「為了笑」\ *（hassādhippāyo）*\ ，《義註》將其翻譯為「為了好玩」或「為了運動」\ *（kiḷādhippāyo）*\ 。

   * - The question of swimming for fitness or exercise is not discussed in any of the texts and seems to have been virtually unheard of in Asia until recent times. Swimming in most Asian countries has long been regarded as a childish form of play, and the one mention in the Canon of athletic bhikkhus keeping their bodies in strong shape is disparaging. In the origin story to `Sg 8`_, Ven. Dabba Mallaputta assigned separate dwellings to different groups of bhikkhus—those who studied the suttas, those who studied the Vinaya, those who meditated, etc.—and, finally, “for those bhikkhus who lived indulging in animal talk and keeping their bodies in strong shape, he assigned dwellings in the same place, ‘So that even these venerable ones will stay as they like.’” Thus it does not seem likely that the Buddha would have recognized physical fitness as an appropriate reason for bhikkhus to go swimming.

     - 游泳健身或鍛鍊身體的問題在任何文獻中均未提及，而且似乎直到近代才在亞洲有所聞。在大多數亞洲國家，游泳一直被視為幼稚的玩樂形式，而《聖典》中關於運動型比丘保持強健體魄的提及更是帶有貶義。在\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 的起源故事中，沓婆摩羅子尊者為不同群體的比丘——研習經藏的、研習律藏的、禪修的等等——分配了不同的住所，最後，「對於那些沉溺於畜生論並保持強健體魄的比丘，他分配了同一住所，『以便連這些尊者，也都能隨意居住。』」因此，佛陀似乎不太可能認可身體健康是比丘們去游泳的適當理由。

   * - On the other hand, if a bhikkhu has a medical motive for swimming—e.g., he has injured his shoulder, and his doctor has recommended that he swim to help speed its healing—this would probably count as an instance of “having business to do in the water” and thus would come under the relevant non-offense clause.

     - 另一方面，如果比丘游泳是為了醫療目的——例如，他的肩膀受傷了，他的醫生建議他游泳以加速癒合——這或許可算作「在水中有事要做」的例子，因此算在相關的不犯條款之下。

   * - **Non-offenses.** The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense in jumping in or out of the water, swimming, or using a boat—
     - **不犯。**\ 《經分別》規定，跳入或躍出水面、游泳或使用船均不構成犯戒—

   * - .. container:: notification

          *Disrespect is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *不尊重，波逸提。*

   * - This rule refers to cases where one has been admonished for one’s behavior. The factors for the full offense are two.
     - 此戒條適用於因行為而受到訓誡的情況。構成完全違犯的因素有二。

   * - *1) Effort:* Having been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya, one shows disrespect
     - *1）努力：*\ 被一位比丘同儕引用律藏裡的戒條訓誡時，表現出不敬。

   * - *2) Object:* for the bhikkhu or for the rule.
     - *2）對象：*\ 對比丘或對戒條。

   * - We will discuss these factors in reverse order.
     - 我們將按相反的順序討論這些因素。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - Only if the bhikkhu cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya is this factor grounds for a pācittiya. If he criticizes one’s actions, citing standards of behavior for the sake of being “self-effacing, scrupulous, or inspiring; for lessening (defilement) or arousing energy” that are not formulated in the Vinaya, this factor becomes grounds for a dukkaṭa. The Commentary limits “not formulated” to teachings in the suttas and Abhidhamma, but there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to suggest that this is so. Its normal way of referring specifically to the suttas and mātikās (the basis for the Abhidhamma) is to say, “another Dhamma,” and so its choice of words here seems intended to include any principle, whether expressed in the other parts of the Canon or not, that aims at the goal of being self-effacing, etc. Thus any teaching devoted to such goals would be grounds for a dukkaṭa.

     - 只有當比丘引用律藏中所制定的戒條時，此因素才構成《波逸提》的依據。如果他批評自己的行為，引用律藏中未明文規定的行為準則，以「謙遜、謹慎或鼓舞人心；減少（煩惱）或激發精進」為目的，則此因素構成《突吉羅》的依據。《義註》將「未明文規定」的範疇限定於經藏和阿毘達摩的教義，但《經分別》中沒有任何內容顯示這一點。它特別指經和論（阿毘達摩的基礎）的通常方式是說「另一種法」，因此這裡的措辭似乎意在包括任何原則，無論是否在經典的其他部分中表達，旨在實現謙遜等目標。因此，任何致力於此類目標的教學都將構成《突吉羅》的依據。

   * - If the person admonishing one is not a bhikkhu, then regardless of whether he/she cites a rule in the Vinaya or standards for being self-effacing, etc., outside of the Vinaya, then the penalty for showing disrespect to that person is a dukkaṭa.

     - 如果訓誡者不是比丘，那麼無論他/她引用的是律藏中的戒條，還是律藏之外的謙遜準則等，對那個人表示不尊重的懲罰是《突吉羅》。

   * - Perception as to whether the person doing the admonishing is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).
     - 對於訓誡者是否受過具足戒的感知，與犯戒無關（參閱\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - The validity of the admonition is not an issue here. Even if the other person is really an ignorant fool, has misinterpreted the rule, or has peculiar ideas on being self-effacing, etc., one should be careful not to show disrespect in word or deed.

     - 勸誡的有效性在這裡並不重要。即使對方真的是個無知的傻瓜，誤解了戒條，或者對謙遜有自己獨特的想法等等，也應該注意不要在言語或行為上表現出不尊重。

   * - If one is being criticized against standards that have nothing to do with being self-effacing, etc., it would not be grounds for an offense. However, a wise policy would be to avoid showing disrespect for another person, regardless of the situation.

     - 如果批評的標準與謙遜等無關，則不構成犯戒。然而，明智的做法是，無論情況如何，都應避免表現出對他人的不尊重。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - There are two possible targets for one’s disrespect—the person and the rule—and two ways of showing it: by word or by gesture.
     - 不尊重有兩個可能的對象——人和戒條——而表達不尊重的方式也有兩種：言語或示意動作。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *Disrespect for the person* includes—

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *對人不尊重*\ 包括—

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          saying things that show disrespect in either a crude or subtle way, e.g., “Who are *you* to tell *me*?” “It’s presumptuous of you to pass judgment when you aren’t in my position,” “Your critical attitude shows that you have some messy emotional problems that you would be well-advised to look into,” “Get lost!” or “Go to hell!”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          以粗魯或微妙的方式說出表現出不尊重的話，例如「\ *你*\ 是誰，憑什麼告訴\ *我*\ ？」「你沒有站在我的立場上就妄加評判，這是很冒昧的」，「你的批判態度表明你有一些混亂的情緒問題，你最好去調查一下」，「滾開！」或「去死吧！」

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          or making a rude gesture or even a slight facial expression to show one’s contempt.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          或者做出粗魯的手勢，甚至輕微的面部表情來表達自己的蔑視。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *Disrespect for the rule* includes—

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *對戒條不尊重*\ 包括—

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          saying, “That’s a stupid rule,” “That rule doesn’t apply to me”;

     - .. container:: mx-2

          說「那是一條愚蠢的戒條」，「那條戒條不適用於我」；

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          stubbornly repeating the action for which one was admonished (this point is covered in `Mv.IV.17.7-9`_);

     - .. container:: mx-2

          固執地重複被訓誡的行為（這點被涵蓋在\ `《大品》.四.17.7-9`_\ 中）；

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          or making a rude gesture, saying, “This is what I think of that rule.”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          或者做出粗魯的示意動作，說「這就是我對該戒條的看法。」

   * - None of the texts explicitly confine this factor to disrespect expressed in the person’s presence. Thus it would seem that if, as a result of the person’s comments, one expresses disrespect behind his or her back, it would fulfill this factor as well.

     - 沒有任何文獻明確規定這一因素僅限於當面表達的不尊重。因此，如果因為對方的言論，導致在對方背後表達不尊重，似乎也滿足這個因素。

   * - **Further action**
     - **進一步行動**

   * - If one persists in acting disrespectfully when being admonished, one may also be subject to `Sg 12`_ or to suspension from the Community (see `BMC2, Chapter 20`_).
     - 如果在受到訓誡時仍然堅持表現出不尊重的行為，則可能還會受到\ `《僧殘》十二`_\ 的處罰或被僧團舉罪（參見\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十章`_\ ）。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - There is no offense if, being admonished, one states simply that one was taught differently by one’s teachers. (The precise words in the Vibhaṅga are, “Such is our teachers’ tradition and catechism.” (§)) The Commentary contains a discussion of which sort of teachers’ tradition is worthy of including in this exemption, but this seems to miss the point. If one can rightfully cite one’s teacher’s instruction as the reason for one’s behavior, then regardless of whether the teacher is right or wrong, such a citation would not count as disrespect.

     - 如果在被訓誡時，僅僅說自己的老師教得不一樣，這並沒有犯戒。（《經分別》的確切措辭是：「這就是我們老師的傳統和教義。」（§））《義註》討論了哪些老師的傳統值得納入這一豁免，但這似乎沒有抓住要點。如果能夠正確地引用自己老師的教導為自己行為的理由，那麼無論老師是對是錯，這樣的引用都不算不尊重。

   * - As `Dhp 76`_ says, one should regard a person who points out one’s faults as a guide who points out hidden treasure. If one shows disrespect to such a guide, it is unlikely that he/she will feel inclined to point out any hidden treasure ever again.

     - 正如\ `《法句》七六`_\ 所說，應該將指出自己過失的人視為指出寶藏的嚮導。如果對這樣的嚮導不敬，那麼他/她很可能永遠不會再想指出任何寶藏。

   * - A good example of how to receive admonishment was set by Ven. Ānanda during the First Council (Cv.XI.1.10). Although he was admonished for committing acts that the Buddha had not declared to be offenses, and although he did not see that he had committed any error, still he willingly confessed his actions as offenses so as to show good faith in his fellow bhikkhus.

     - 阿難尊者在第一次結集（\ `《小品》.十一.1.10`_\ ）中樹立了接受訓誡的典範。儘管他因犯下佛陀未明示的罪行而受到訓誡，儘管他並未意識到自己犯了任何過錯，但他仍然願意承認自己的行為是罪行，以向比丘同儕們展現誠意信心。

   * - **A related rule**
     - **相關戒條**

   * - Pc 71 covers the case of a bhikkhu who, trying to avoid an offense under this rule, uses a ploy to get out of altering his behavior in response to an admonition. For details, see the explanation under that rule.

     - 《波逸提》七一涵蓋比丘為了避免違反本戒條，使用計謀逃避因勸誡而改變行為的情況。詳情請參閱該戒條的解釋。

   * - *Summary: Speaking or acting disrespectfully after having been admonished by another bhikkhu for a breach of the training rules is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：在因違反學處而受到另一位比丘的訓誡後，如果言語或行為不敬，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - One wants to frighten the other person.
     - 想驚嚇另一個人。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - One arranges a frightening sight, sound, smell, taste, or tactile sensation—this would include such things as hanging a sheet in a dark room so that it looks like a ghost, making a ghostly wail outside the person’s window, etc.—\ *or* one describes dangers from ghosts, robbers, or wild animals.

   * - **Object**

   * - The other person is a bhikkhu. Anyone who is not a bhikkhu is grounds for a dukkaṭa.
     - 另一個人是比丘。任何不是比丘的人都構成《突吉羅》。

   * - Perception as to whether the person one is trying to frighten is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).
     - 至於試圖驚嚇的人是否受過具足戒的感知，則與犯戒無關（參閱\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - “Result” is not a factor here. If the three factors are fulfilled, one commits the offense regardless of whether the other person is actually frightened.
     - 「結果」在這裡不是一個因素。如果三個因素都滿足，那麼無論對方是否真的被驚嚇到，都構成犯戒。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - To inform another person of dangers from ghosts, robbers, etc., without intending to frighten him/her constitutes no offense. The same exemption holds for arranging a sight, sound, smell, taste, or tactile sensation without the intention of causing fright.

     - 告知他人鬼怪、盜賊等危險，而非有意驚嚇他人，不構成犯戒。同樣，營造視覺、聽覺、嗅覺、味覺或觸覺，而非有意驚嚇他人，亦不構成犯戒。

   * - Here again the factors for the full offense are three.
     - 再次，此處構成完全違犯的因素有三。

   * - *1) Object:* One is not ill.
     - *1）對象：*\ 自己沒有生病。

   * - *2) Effort:* One lights a fire or gets someone else to light one
     - *2）努力：*\ 自己點火或讓別人點火

   * - *3) Intention:* for the purpose of warming oneself.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 以取暖為目的。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - *Not ill*, in the context of this rule, means that one can fare comfortably without warming oneself. The Vibhaṅga makes the point that perception as to whether one is actually ill is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_). What this means is that when it is chilly outside, one should be very sure that extra warmth is necessary for one’s health before lighting a fire to warm oneself.

     - 在本戒條的脈絡中，「\ *無病*\ 」是指無需取暖即可舒適地生活。《經分別》指出，是否真的生病的感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。這意味著，當外面很冷時，在生火取暖之前，應該非常確定額外的保暖對健康是必要的。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - *Lighting a fire* at present would include turning on the flame in a heating system in one’s dwelling for the sake of the warmth. Solar or electric heating systems, which do not use flames, would not be included here.

     - 目前，\ *生火*\ 包括為了取暖而打開住處供暖系統的火焰。不使用火焰的太陽能或電加熱系統不在此列。

   * - *Getting a fire lit*, according to the Vibhaṅga, means ordering another person to light a fire. Thus there is apparently room for *kappiya-vohāra* under this rule, as long as one’s suggestion for lighting a fire not be an express command.

     - 根據《經分別》，「\ *令點火*\ 」意味著命令他人點火。因此，只要點火的建議不是明確的命令，這條戒條下顯然就有 *kappiya-vohāra* 的空間。

   * - If, when not ill, one orders someone else to light a fire (or fires) for the purpose of warming oneself, there is a pācittiya in making the order, and another pācittiya when the other person lights the fire(s), regardless of how many fires are lit as a result of the one order. To return a burning piece of fuel to a fire is grounds for a dukkaṭa; adding new fuel to a fire—according to the Commentary—is grounds for a pācittiya.

     - 如果在無病的情況下，為了取暖而命令別人生火，那麼發出命令時會犯一次《波逸提》，而當別人生火時，無論因這個命令而生了多少火，犯另一次《波逸提》。將燃燒的燃料放回火中構成《突吉羅》；根據《義註》，往火中添加新的燃料構成《波逸提》。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - There is no offense if one lights a fire or has one lit for purposes other than warming oneself. Thus one may light a lamp or light a fire to boil water, burn dead leaves, or fire an alms bowl without penalty. `Cv.V.32.1`_ says that if a forest fire is approaching one’s dwelling, one may light a counter-fire to ward off its approach. In other circumstances, though, `Pc 10`_ would impose a penalty for lighting a fire on top of “live” soil; and `Pc 11`_ would impose a further penalty for damaging plant life.

     - 如果出於取暖以外的目的而生火或讓人生火，則不構成犯戒。因此，們可以點燈或點火燒水、燒枯葉或燒缽，而不會受到懲罰。\ `《小品》.五.32.1`_ 說，如果森林大火正在逼近住所，可以點燃逆火以阻止火勢蔓延。不過，在其他情況下，\ `《波逸提》十`_\ 規定，在「活」土壤上生火會受到懲罰；\ `《波逸提》十一`_\ 規定，破壞植物生命會受到進一步懲罰。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - In addition, there is no offense in warming oneself at raked-out coals or at a fire lit by someone else (not at one’s request). And there is no offense in lighting a fire when there are dangers. This, the Commentary says, refers to cases when one is bitten by a snake (and wants to make the snake-bite medicine mentioned under `Pc 40`_), when one is surrounded by robbers, or disturbed by non-human beings or beasts of prey.

     - 此外，用耙出的煤塊或他人點燃的火（非本人要求）取暖也不犯戒。在危險的情況下生火也不犯戒。《義註》指出，這指的是被蛇咬傷（並想製作\ `《波逸提》四十`_\ 中提到的蛇咬藥）、被強盜包圍或被非人或猛獸騷擾的情況。

   * - `Cv.V.14.1`_ allows bhikkhus to use a “fire hall (§),” similar to a sauna at present, for the purpose of inducing perspiration for health reasons. According to the Vibhaṅga, there is no offense in lighting a fire in a place such as this.

     - `《小品》.五.14.1`_ 允許比丘使用類似現在桑拿房的「火堂」（§），以促進排汗，從而達到保健目的。根據《經分別》，在這樣的地方生火並無犯戒。

   * - The purpose of this rule is suggested by AN 5:219, which lists the five disadvantages of sitting around a fire: It is bad for one’s eyes, bad for one’s skin, bad for one’s strength, and (most importantly, in this context) groups tend to form (that can turn into factions), and they spend their time in animal talk.

     - 這條戒條的目的由\ `《增支部》5:219經`_\ 提出，其中列出了圍坐在火堆旁的五個缺點：對眼睛有害、對皮膚有害、對體力有害，並且（最重要的是，在這種脈絡下）容易形成團體（可能變成派系），他們會把時間花在畜生論上。

   * - *Summary: Lighting a fire to warm oneself—or having it lit—when one does not need the warmth for one’s health is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：當不需要溫暖來保持健康時，點火取暖或讓人點火是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

(There was a similar temporary rule, against eating mangoes (`Cv.V.5.1`_), that the Buddha formulated when King Bimbisāra had invited the bhikkhus to help themselves to his mangoes, and some group-of-six bhikkhus went and took all the mangoes in his park, even the unripe ones. The rule was later rescinded (`Cv.V.5.2`_) when the Buddha allowed bhikkhus to eat any and all fruit as long as it was allowable in any of the five ways mentioned under `Pc 11`_.)

     - 這條戒條的最初制定——沒有「適當時間」的開緣——似乎是針對那些給國王帶來不便的比丘們的臨時懲戒措施。（佛陀也曾制定過一條類似的臨時戒律，禁止食用芒果（\ `《小品》.五.5.1`_\ ）。當時頻毘娑羅王邀請比丘們隨意享用他的芒果，結果有六群比丘去把王園裡所有的芒果都吃光了，連未熟的也吃光了。後來，佛陀允許比丘吃任何水果，只要符合\ `《波逸提》十一`_\ 中提到的五種方式中的任何一種是允許的，這條戒條就被廢除了（\ `《小品》.五.5.2`_\ ）。）

   * - As for this rule: Once the proper occasions were added, they relaxed it considerably. For instance:
     - 至於這條戒條：一旦增加了適當的時間，他們就大大放寬了。例如：

          *生病的時候*\ 是指不沐浴就覺得不舒服的任何時候；

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *刮風或下雨的時候*\ ，就是刮起一陣塵土飛揚的風，及至少落下兩三滴雨到身上。

   * - In addition, `Mv.V.13`_ tells the story of Ven. Mahā Kaccāna’s leaving the middle Ganges Valley and settling in Avantī, to the south. After some time, one of his students—Ven. Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa—asked permission to visit the Buddha. Ven. Mahā Kaccāna gave his permission, together with a request to convey to the Buddha: that certain rules inappropriate for areas outside of the Ganges Valley—this rule among them—be rescinded for bhikkhus living in outlying districts. The Buddha complied with the request and defined the outlying districts in such a way that there is nowhere in the world outside of the middle Ganges Valley where this rule applies.

     - 此外，\ `《大品》.五.13`_ 也講述了摩訶迦旃延尊者離開恆河中游，定居於南邊的阿槃提的故事。一段時間後，他的一位弟子——首樓那億耳尊者——請求准許去拜見佛陀。摩訶迦旃延尊者同意了，但他同時請求轉告佛陀：一些不適用於恆河流域以外地區的戒條——其中包括這條戒條——對於居住在邊遠地區的比丘來說，應予以廢除。佛陀遵從了該請求，並劃定了邊遠地區的範圍，使得世界上除恆河中游地區外，沒有任何地方適用這條戒條。

   * - **Offenses**
     - **犯戒**

   * - For those who live in the middle Ganges Valley, the offenses for bathing more frequently than once a fortnight outside of the proper occasions are these: a dukkaṭa for every time one scrubs oneself with *chunam* (bathing powder) or clay (soap), and a pācittiya when one has finished bathing.

     - 對於居住在恆河中游者來說，在適當時間之外每半個月沐浴超過一次的犯戒如下：每次用 *chunam* （沐浴粉）或黏土（肥皂）擦身體犯一次《突吉羅》，沐浴完畢犯一次《波逸提》。

   * - Perception as to whether a fortnight has actually passed is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 對於半個月是否真的已經過去的感知並不是這裡的減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - In addition to the allowances to bathe more frequently than once a fortnight during the proper occasions or in areas outside the middle Ganges Valley, there is no offense in bathing more frequently if one is crossing a river or if there are dangers. This last allowance the Commentary explains with an example: One is being chased by bees and so jumps into the water to escape them.

     - 除了在適當時間或在恆河中游以外的地區允許每半個月沐浴一次以上之外，如果要過河或遇到危險，更頻繁地沐浴也無犯戒。《義註》舉例解釋了最後一種開緣：被蜜蜂追趕，於是跳入水中躲避。

   * - Summary: Bathing more frequently than once a fortnight when residing in the middle Ganges Valley, except on certain occasions, is a pācittiya offense.
     - 摘要：居住在恆河中游地區時，除特定場合外，每半個月沐浴超過一次，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。

          *When a bhikkhu receives a new robe, any one of three means of discoloring it is to be applied: green, brown, or black. If a bhikkhu should make use of a new robe without applying any of the three means of discoloring it, it is to be confessed.*

          “Now at that time many bhikkhus and wanderers were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. On the way, thieves came out and robbed them. Royal officials, coming out of Sāvatthī and capturing the thieves with the goods, sent a messenger to the bhikkhus, saying, ‘Come, your reverences. Let each identify his own robes and take them.’ The bhikkhus couldn’t identify their robes. People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can their reverences not identify their own robes?’”

          「\ `其時，許多比丘和遊方者從沙祇前往舍衛城。 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0160a10>`_\ 途中，盜賊出沒，劫掠了他們。王國官員從舍衛城出來，擒獲了盜賊和財物，便派使者去見比丘，說道：「諸大德，來吧，各認各的袈裟，帶走。」比丘們認不出自己的袈裟。人們紛紛批評、抱怨，並四處散播：『諸大德怎麼會認不出自己的袈裟呢？』」

   * - **Protocol**
     - **行儀**

   * - As this rule indicates, a bhikkhu should wear robes only that have been marked with an identifying mark. The Vibhaṅga does not go into any great detail on procedures for marking a robe, aside from saying that the mark may be as small as the tip of a blade of grass, and can be made with any of the colors mentioned in the rule. (The color green in Pali also covers the color blue, so a mark made with blue ink would be acceptable.)

     - 正如這條戒條所示，比丘只能穿著帶有識別標記的袈裟。《經分別》並未詳細闡述在袈裟上做標記的步驟，只是說標記可以小到草尖，並且可以用戒條中提到的任何顏色來標記。（巴利語中的綠色也涵蓋藍色，因此用藍墨水做的標記是可以接受的。）

   * - The Commentary goes into more detail: After the robe has been dyed, one should make a round mark no smaller than the size of a bedbug’s back and no larger than the iris of a peacock’s eye in all four corners of the robe, three corners, two, or one, as one sees fit. Only round marks are allowable. Such things as lines or angular marks (squares, triangles, or stars) are not. Because these prohibitions have no basis in the Canon or the Great Standards, they are not binding.

     - 《義註》對此進行了更詳細的闡述：袈裟染色後，應在袈裟的四個角（三個角、兩個角或一個角，視情況而定）上，做一個不小於臭蟲背部大小、不大於孔雀眼虹膜大小的圓形標記。只允許做圓形標記。不允許做線狀或有角的標記（正方形、三角形或星形）。由於這些禁令在《聖典》或《四大教示》中均無依據，因此不具約束力。

   * - As the Vibhaṅga notes, once the robe has been marked there is no need to mark it again, even if the mark wears off, the marked part of the robe gets worn through age, one sews a marked cloth together with an unmarked one, or one patches, darns, or adds a hem to a marked robe. If Bhikkhu X marks a robe and then gives it to Bhikkhu Y, Y may wear it without having to mark it again.

     - 《分別論》指出，一旦袈裟上有標記，就無需再標記。即使標記磨損，或標記部分因時間久遠而磨損，或將標記的布料與未標記的布料縫合在一起，或為標記的袈裟打補丁、縫補或加邊，也無需再次標記。如果比丘 X 在袈裟上做了標記，然後將其給予比丘 Y ，Y 可以穿著它，而無需再次標記。

   * - In Thailand at present, the custom is to make three small dots in one corner of the robe, saying, *“Imaṁ bindu-kappaṁ karomi,”* (I make this properly marked) while making each dot. This procedure does not appear in the Canon or commentaries, but does not conflict with any of them.

     - 泰國目前的習俗是在袈裟的一角點三個小點，每點一個，都要說\ *「Imaṁ bindu-kappaṁ karomi」*\ （我適當地標記之）。此做法並未見於《聖典》或註釋書，但與它們也並不衝突。

   * - The factors for the offense here are two: *object*\—a new robe; and *effort*\—one makes use of it without first marking it.
     - 這裡的犯戒因素有兩個：\ *對象*\ ——一件新袈裟；以及\ *努力*\ ——在沒有先標記的情況下使用它。
