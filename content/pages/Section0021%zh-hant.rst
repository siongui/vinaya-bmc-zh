          “Then Ven. Sāgata went to the hermitage of the coiled-hair ascetic of Ambatittha, and on arrival—having entered the fire building and arranged a grass mat—sat down cross-legged with his body erect and mindfulness to the fore. The nāga (living in the fire building) saw that Ven. Sāgata had entered and, on seeing him, was upset, disgruntled, and emitted smoke. Ven. Sāgata emitted smoke. The nāga, unable to bear his rage, blazed up. Ven. Sāgata, entering the fire element, blazed up. Then Ven. Sāgata, having consumed the nāga’s fire with his own fire, left for Bhaddavatikā.

          “Then the Kosambī lay followers, having prepared pigeon’s liquor in house after house, and seeing that Ven.

          （§—泰國版和斯里蘭卡版的《聖典》拼讀為 *deḍḍubhena-pi* 。）

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - *Alcohol* means any alcoholic beverage made from grain, yeast, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include whiskey, beer, vodka, and gin. *Fermented liquor* means any alcoholic beverage made from flowers, fruits, honey, sugar, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include wine, mead, and rum. Together, the two terms are meant to cover all kinds of alcoholic beverages.

     - *酒精*\ 是指任何由穀物、酵母或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括威士忌、啤酒、伏特加和金酒。\ *發酵酒*\ 是指任何由花、水果、蜂蜜、糖或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括葡萄酒、蜂蜜酒和蘭姆酒。這兩個術語合在一起，旨在涵蓋所有種類的酒精飲料。

   * - There is some controversy as to what other substances would be included in this factor in line with the Great Standards. Because the Canon repeatedly criticizes alcohol on the grounds that it destroys one’s sense of shame, weakens one’s discernment, and can put one into a stupor—as happened to Ven. Sāgata—it seems reasonable to extend this rule to other intoxicants, narcotics, and hallucinogens as well. Thus things like marijuana, hashish, heroin, cocaine, and LSD would fulfill this factor. Coffee, tea, tobacco, and betel do not have this effect, though, so there is no reason to include them here.

     - 關於哪些其他物質符合《四大教示》，也應納入此因素，存在一些爭議。由於《聖典》一再批評酒精，認為它會損害人的羞恥感，削弱人的辨識力，並可能使人神智不清——就像娑伽陀尊者所遭遇的那樣——因此，將這一戒條擴展到其他麻醉品、麻醉劑和致幻劑似乎也合情合理。因此，大麻、大麻樹脂、海洛因、古柯鹼和迷幻藥（LSD）等東西符合此因素。然而，咖啡、茶、菸草和檳榔不具有這種效果，因此沒有理由將它們納入此處。

   * - Perception as to whether a liquid counts as alcohol or liquor is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_). Thus a bhikkhu drinking champagne that he thinks to be carbonated apple juice *would* fall under this factor, regardless of his ignorance.

     - 對於某種液體是否屬於酒精或含酒精飲料的感知，並非此處的減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。因此，如果一位比丘喝了他認為是碳酸蘋果汁的香檳，那麼無論他是否無知，\ *都*\ 符合這一因素。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *drinking* as taking even as little as the tip of a blade of grass. Thus taking a small glass of wine, even though it might not be enough to make one drunk, would be more than enough to fulfill this factor.

     - 《經分別》將\ *飲用*\ 定義為哪怕只喝一小片草尖。因此，喝一小杯酒，即使不足以讓人醉，也足以滿足這項條件。

   * - The Vibhaṅga does not, however, indicate how offenses are to be counted here. According to the Commentary, the number of offenses involved in taking an alcoholic drink is determined by the number of separate sips. As for intoxicants taken by means other than sipping, each separate effort would count as an offense.

     - 然而，《經分別》並未指明此處如何計算犯戒次數。根據《義註》，飲酒的犯戒次數取決於單獨啜飲的次數。至於以啜飲以外的方式使用麻醉品，每次單獨努力都算作一次犯戒。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense in taking items that are non-alcoholic, but whose color, taste, or smell is like alcohol. Thus, for example, carbonated apple juice that resembles champagne would not be grounds for an offense.

     - 《經分別》規定，飲用不含酒精但顏色、味道或氣味類似酒精的飲品並不構成犯戒。例如，類似香檳的碳酸蘋果汁不構成犯戒。

   * - There is also no offense in taking alcohol “cooked in broth, meat, or oil.” The Commentary interprets the first two items as referring to sauces, stews, and meat dishes to which alcoholic beverages, such as wine, are added for flavoring before they are cooked. Because the alcohol would evaporate during the cooking, it would have no intoxicating effect. Foods containing unevaporated alcohol—such as rum babas—would not be included under this allowance.

     - 飲用「用肉湯、肉或油烹調的」酒類也不犯戒。《義註》將前兩項解釋為醬汁、燉菜和肉類菜餚，在烹飪前會加入諸如葡萄酒等酒精飲料調味。由於酒精會在烹調過程中揮發，因此不會產生醉人效果。含有未揮發酒精的食物（例如蘭姆巴巴）不在此開緣之列。

   * - As for alcohol cooked in oil, this refers to a medicine used in the Buddha’s time for afflictions of the “wind element.” The Mahāvagga (VI.14.1) allows this medicine for internal use only as long as the taste, color, and smell of the alcohol are not perceptible. From this point, the Vinaya-mukha argues that morphine and other narcotics used as pain killers are allowable as well.

     - 至於油裡煮的酒，指的是佛陀時代用來治療「風大」不調的藥物。\ `《大品》（六.14.1）`_\ 規定，這種藥物只能內服，但酒的味道、顏色和氣味必須無法察覺。從這一點來看，《戒律入口》認為嗎啡和其他用於止痛的麻醉劑也是可以允許的。

   * - In addition, the non-offense clauses state, “With regard to molasses and emblic myrobalan, (there is no offense) if he drinks unfermented *ariṭṭha*.” The Commentary explains this as follows: “There is no offense for non-alcoholic *ariṭṭha*. They reportedly make ariṭṭha with the juice of such fruits as emblic myrobalan, which has the color, smell, and taste of alcohol but is not alcoholic: This is what is meant. That which has the starter thrown in, however, is alcoholic, and even the mother (of this kind of *ariṭṭha*) is unallowable.”

     - 此外，不犯條款規定：「至於糖蜜和餘甘子，如果他飲用未發酵的 *ariṭṭha* ，（不犯戒）。」《義註》對此解釋如下：「不含酒精的 *ariṭṭha* 不犯戒。據說他們用諸如餘甘子等水果的汁液製作 ariṭṭha ，有酒的顏色、氣味和味道，但不含酒精：這就是它的意思。然而，加入發酵劑者含有酒精，即使（這種 *ariṭṭha* 的）母體也是不允許的。」

   * - *Summary: Taking an intoxicant is a pācittiya offense regardless of whether one is aware that it is an intoxicant.*
     - *摘要：服用麻醉物是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪，無論是否知道它是麻醉物。*

   * - There are three factors for the full offense here.
     - 這裡的完全違犯有三個因素。

   * - *1) Object:* another bhikkhu.
     - *1）對象：*\ 另一位比丘。

   * - *2) Effort:* One touches any part of his body with any part of one’s own body
     - *2）努力：*\ 用自己身體的任何部位觸碰他的身體的任何部位

   * - *3) Intention:* for fun.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 為了好玩。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - A bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya here; any unordained person, grounds for a dukkaṭa. The Vibhaṅga does not say whether *unordained* here includes bhikkhunīs. The Commentary states explicitly that it does, adding that a bhikkhu looking for a little fun can tickle a bhikkhunī without incurring a penalty stronger than a dukkaṭa. There are occasional attempts at humor in the Commentary, and we can probably write this off as one of them.

     - 比丘在此構成《波逸提》；任何未受具足戒者，構成《突吉羅》。《經分別》並未說此處的\ *未受具足戒*\ 是否包括比丘尼。《義註》明確指出，包括比丘尼，並補充說，想找點樂子的比丘可以搔比丘尼癢，而不會遭受比《突吉羅》更重的懲罰。《義註》中偶爾會有一些幽默的嘗試，我們或許可以把這算作其中之一。

   * - Perception as to whether the person being tickled is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).
     - 被搔癢的人是否受過具足戒的感知與犯戒無關（參閱\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**

   * - This factor is fulfilled only by body-to-body contact, as defined at length under `Sg 2`_. The following actions, if done with the intent of making the other person laugh, would be grounds for a dukkaṭa here regardless of whether the person was ordained or not:

     - 這一因素僅透過身體對身體的接觸才能滿足，如\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 中詳細定義的那樣。如果以逗別人笑為目的而做出以下行為，則無論該人是否受具足戒，在此都構成《突吉羅》：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          using an item connected with the body—such as a stick—to poke at the person;

   * - **Intention**

   * - If one has legitimate motives for touching the other person aside from a desire for fun, there is no penalty in doing so. Thus a bhikkhu massaging another bhikkhu’s tired back commits no offense if he inadvertently happens to touch a spot where the other bhikkhu is ticklish. However, touching another bhikkhu in anger would come under `Pc 74`_.

     - 如果除了為了好玩之外，有正當動機觸碰他人，則這樣做不會受到任何懲罰。例如，一位比丘在按摩另一位比丘疲憊的背部時，如果無意中觸碰到了另一位比丘怕癢的部位，則不構成犯戒。然而，憤怒地觸碰另一位比丘則算在\ `《波逸提》七四`_\ 。

          *在水中玩耍的行為，波逸提。*

   * - Here again, the factors for the full offense are three.
     - 此處再次，構成完全違犯的因素有三。

   * - *1) Effort:* One jumps up or down, splashes, or swims
     - *1）努力：*\ 跳起或跳下、濺起水花或游泳

   * - *2) Object:* in water deep enough to immerse one’s ankle
     - *2）對象：*\ 水深足以浸沒腳踝

   * - *3) Intention:* for fun.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 為了好玩。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga is silent on how to count offenses under this rule. According to the Commentary, each individual effort counts as a separate offense. Thus if one is swimming for fun, one incurs a pācittiya for each hand or foot stroke.

     - 《經分別》並沒有說明如何根據這條戒條計算犯戒。根據《義註》，每一次單獨的努力都算作一次單獨的犯戒。因此，如果只是為了好玩而游泳，那麼每次划手或划腳都犯一次《波逸提》。

   * - Perception as to whether one’s actions count as “playing in the water” is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 關於自己的行為是否算作「在水中玩耍」的感知在這裡並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - Jumping up or down in water less than ankle deep entails a dukkaṭa, as does splashing water with the hands, feet, a stick, or a piece of tile; or playing with water or other liquids—such as rice gruel, milk, buttermilk, colored dyes, urine, or mud—in a vessel.

     - 在水深不到腳踝的水中跳上跳下犯《突吉羅》，用手、腳、棍子或瓷磚濺起水花也一樣；或玩在容器中的水或其他液體（如米粥、牛奶、酪乳、彩色染料、尿液或泥漿）。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that there is also a dukkaṭa for playing in a boat. This the Commentary illustrates with examples: such things as paddling a boat with an oar, propelling it with a pole, or pushing it up on shore. At present, sailing a sailboat or steering a motorboat would come under this factor.

     - 《經分別》指出，在船上玩耍也犯《突吉羅》。《義註》舉例說明了這一點：例如用槳划船、用篙撐船、或將船推上岸。目前，駕駛帆船或駕駛摩托艇都算在此因素之下。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines this factor as “for a laugh” *(hassādhippāyo)*, which the Commentary translates as “for fun” or “for sport” *(kiḷādhippāyo)*.
     - 《經分別》將此因素定義為「為了笑」\ *（hassādhippāyo）*\ ，《義註》將其翻譯為「為了好玩」或「為了運動」\ *（kiḷādhippāyo）*\ 。

   * - The question of swimming for fitness or exercise is not discussed in any of the texts and seems to have been virtually unheard of in Asia until recent times. Swimming in most Asian countries has long been regarded as a childish form of play, and the one mention in the Canon of athletic bhikkhus keeping their bodies in strong shape is disparaging. In the origin story to `Sg 8`_, Ven. Dabba Mallaputta assigned separate dwellings to different groups of bhikkhus—those who studied the suttas, those who studied the Vinaya, those who meditated, etc.—and, finally, “for those bhikkhus who lived indulging in animal talk and keeping their bodies in strong shape, he assigned dwellings in the same place, ‘So that even these venerable ones will stay as they like.’” Thus it does not seem likely that the Buddha would have recognized physical fitness as an appropriate reason for bhikkhus to go swimming.

     - 游泳健身或鍛鍊身體的問題在任何文獻中均未提及，而且似乎直到近代才在亞洲有所聞。在大多數亞洲國家，游泳一直被視為幼稚的玩樂形式，而《聖典》中關於運動型比丘保持強健體魄的提及更是帶有貶義。在\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 的起源故事中，沓婆摩羅子尊者為不同群體的比丘——研習經藏的、研習律藏的、禪修的等等——分配了不同的住所，最後，「對於那些沉溺於畜生論並保持強健體魄的比丘，他分配了同一住所，『以便連這些尊者，也都能隨意居住。』」因此，佛陀似乎不太可能認可身體健康是比丘們去游泳的適當理由。

   * - On the other hand, if a bhikkhu has a medical motive for swimming—e.g., he has injured his shoulder, and his doctor has recommended that he swim to help speed its healing—this would probably count as an instance of “having business to do in the water” and thus would come under the relevant non-offense clause.

     - 另一方面，如果比丘游泳是為了醫療目的——例如，他的肩膀受傷了，他的醫生建議他游泳以加速癒合——這或許可算作「在水中有事要做」的例子，因此算在相關的不犯條款之下。

   * - **Non-offenses.** The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense in jumping in or out of the water, swimming, or using a boat—
     - **不犯。**\ 《經分別》規定，跳入或躍出水面、游泳或使用船均不構成犯戒—
