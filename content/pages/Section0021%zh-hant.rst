          “Then Ven. Sāgata went to the hermitage of the coiled-hair ascetic of Ambatittha, and on arrival—having entered the fire building and arranged a grass mat—sat down cross-legged with his body erect and mindfulness to the fore. The nāga (living in the fire building) saw that Ven. Sāgata had entered and, on seeing him, was upset, disgruntled, and emitted smoke. Ven. Sāgata emitted smoke. The nāga, unable to bear his rage, blazed up. Ven. Sāgata, entering the fire element, blazed up. Then Ven. Sāgata, having consumed the nāga’s fire with his own fire, left for Bhaddavatikā.

          「\ `其時，娑伽陀尊者前往安巴提達盤髮苦行者的隱居處 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0145a03>`_\ ，到達後，他進入火舍，鋪好草蓆，盤腿而坐，端正身軀，將正念置於前。龍眾（住在火舍中）看到娑伽陀尊者進來，見狀感到不安、不滿，並噴出煙霧。娑伽陀尊者也噴出煙霧。彼龍不勝怒而放出火焰。娑伽陀尊者入於火界三昧，也放出火焰。娑伽陀尊者以自己的火焰燒盡彼龍之火焰，然後前往跋陀越邑。

          “Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bhaddavatikā as long as he liked, left on a walking tour to Kosambī. The lay followers of Kosambī heard, ‘They say that Ven. Sāgata did battle with the Ambatittha nāga!’

          「時，世尊在跋陀越邑隨意住宿，然後步行前往憍賞彌。憍賞彌的優婆塞們聽說：『據說娑伽陀尊者曾與跋陀越邑的龍戰鬥過！』

          “Then the Blessed One, having toured by stages, came to Kosambī. The Kosambī lay followers, after welcoming the Blessed One, went to Ven. Sāgata and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, ‘What, venerable sir, is something the masters like that is hard for you to get? What can we prepare for you?’

          「世尊次第遊行後，來到了憍賞彌。憍賞彌的優婆塞們迎接世尊後，前往娑伽陀尊者處。到達後，他們向他頂禮，並在一旁坐下。坐下後，他們對他說：『大德，尊師們有什麼喜好且難以得到之物嗎？我們可以為您準備什麼嗎？』

          “When this was said, some group-of-six bhikkhus said to the Kosambī lay followers, ‘Friends, there is a strong liquor called pigeon’s liquor (the color of pigeons’ feet, according to the Commentary) that the bhikkhus like and is hard for them to get. Prepare that.’

          「如是言時，六群比丘對憍賞彌的優婆塞們說道：『朋友們，有一種烈酒叫鴿子酒（根據《義註》，鴿子腳的顏色），比丘們都喜歡，但很難得到。準備那個吧。』

          “Then the Kosambī lay followers, having prepared pigeon’s liquor in house after house, and seeing that Ven. Sāgata had gone out for alms, said to him, ‘Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor! Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor!’ Then Ven. Sāgata, having drunk pigeon’s liquor in house after house, passed out at the city gate as he was leaving the city.

          「於是，憍賞彌的優婆塞們家家戶戶地準備了鴿子酒，看到娑伽陀尊者出去托缽，就對他說：『娑伽陀尊者，喝點鴿子酒吧！娑伽陀尊者，喝點鴿子酒吧！』娑伽陀尊者家家戶戶地喝完鴿子酒後，出城時，倒臥在城門口。
