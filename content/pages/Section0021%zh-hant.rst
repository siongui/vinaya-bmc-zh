          “Then Ven. Sāgata went to the hermitage of the coiled-hair ascetic of Ambatittha, and on arrival—having entered the fire building and arranged a grass mat—sat down cross-legged with his body erect and mindfulness to the fore. The nāga (living in the fire building) saw that Ven. Sāgata had entered and, on seeing him, was upset, disgruntled, and emitted smoke. Ven. Sāgata emitted smoke. The nāga, unable to bear his rage, blazed up. Ven. Sāgata, entering the fire element, blazed up. Then Ven. Sāgata, having consumed the nāga’s fire with his own fire, left for Bhaddavatikā.

          「\ `其時，娑伽陀尊者前往安巴提達盤髮苦行者的隱居處 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0145a03>`_\ ，到達後，他進入火舍，鋪好草蓆，盤腿而坐，端正身軀，將正念置於前。龍眾（住在火舍中）看到娑伽陀尊者進來，見狀感到不安、不滿，並噴出煙霧。娑伽陀尊者也噴出煙霧。彼龍不勝怒而放出火焰。娑伽陀尊者入於火界三昧，也放出火焰。娑伽陀尊者以自己的火焰燒盡彼龍之火焰，然後前往跋陀越邑。

          “Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bhaddavatikā as long as he liked, left on a walking tour to Kosambī. The lay followers of Kosambī heard, ‘They say that Ven. Sāgata did battle with the Ambatittha nāga!’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「時，世尊在跋陀越邑隨意住宿，然後步行前往憍賞彌。憍賞彌的優婆塞們聽說：『據說娑伽陀尊者曾與跋陀越邑的龍戰鬥過！』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then the Blessed One, having toured by stages, came to Kosambī. The Kosambī lay followers, after welcoming the Blessed One, went to Ven. Sāgata and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, ‘What, venerable sir, is something the masters like that is hard for you to get? What can we prepare for you?’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「世尊次第遊行後，來到了憍賞彌。憍賞彌的優婆塞們迎接世尊後，前往娑伽陀尊者處。到達後，他們向他頂禮，並在一旁坐下。坐下後，他們對他說：『大德，尊師們有什麼喜好且難以得到之物嗎？我們可以為您準備什麼嗎？』

          “When this was said, some group-of-six bhikkhus said to the Kosambī lay followers, ‘Friends, there is a strong liquor called pigeon’s liquor (the color of pigeons’ feet, according to the Commentary) that the bhikkhus like and is hard for them to get. Prepare that.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「如是言時，六群比丘對憍賞彌的優婆塞們說道：『朋友們，有一種烈酒叫鴿子酒（根據《義註》，鴿子腳的顏色），比丘們都喜歡，但很難得到。準備那個吧。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then the Kosambī lay followers, having prepared pigeon’s liquor in house after house, and seeing that Ven. Sāgata had gone out for alms, said to him, ‘Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor! Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor!’ Then Ven. Sāgata, having drunk pigeon’s liquor in house after house, passed out at the city gate as he was leaving the city.

          「於是，憍賞彌的優婆塞們家家戶戶地準備了鴿子酒，看到娑伽陀尊者出去托缽，就對他說：『娑伽陀尊者，喝點鴿子酒吧！娑伽陀尊者，喝點鴿子酒吧！』娑伽陀尊者家家戶戶地喝完鴿子酒後，出城時，倒臥在城門口。

          “Then the Blessed One, leaving the city with a number of bhikkhus, saw that Ven. Sāgata had passed out at the city gate. On seeing him, he addressed the bhikkhus, saying, ‘Bhikkhus, pick up Sāgata.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「那時，世尊與一群比丘離開城市，看到娑伽陀尊者倒臥在城門口。見到他後，世尊對比丘們說：『比丘們，扶持娑伽陀。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Responding, ‘As you say, venerable sir,’ the bhikkhus took Ven. Sāgata to the monastery and laid him down with his head toward the Blessed One. Then Ven. Sāgata turned around and went to sleep with his feet toward the Blessed One. So the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying, ‘In the past, wasn’t Sāgata respectful to the Tathāgata and deferential?’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「答道：『如你所言，世尊。』比丘們把娑伽陀尊者帶回寺院，讓他頭朝向世尊躺下。然後娑伽陀尊者轉過身去，雙腳朝向世尊，繼續睡著了。世尊便對比丘們說道：『過去，娑伽陀對如來不是恭敬順從的嗎？』

          “‘Yes, venerable sir.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          （§—泰國版和斯里蘭卡版的《聖典》拼讀為 *deḍḍubhena-pi* 。）

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - *Alcohol* means any alcoholic beverage made from grain, yeast, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include whiskey, beer, vodka, and gin. *Fermented liquor* means any alcoholic beverage made from flowers, fruits, honey, sugar, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include wine, mead, and rum. Together, the two terms are meant to cover all kinds of alcoholic beverages.

     - *酒精*\ 是指任何由穀物、酵母或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括威士忌、啤酒、伏特加和金酒。\ *發酵酒*\ 是指任何由花、水果、蜂蜜、糖或任何成分組合製成的酒精飲料。現在的例子包括葡萄酒、蜂蜜酒和蘭姆酒。這兩個術語合在一起，旨在涵蓋所有種類的酒精飲料。

   * - There is some controversy as to what other substances would be included in this factor in line with the Great Standards. Because the Canon repeatedly criticizes alcohol on the grounds that it destroys one’s sense of shame, weakens one’s discernment, and can put one into a stupor—as happened to Ven. Sāgata—it seems reasonable to extend this rule to other intoxicants, narcotics, and hallucinogens as well. Thus things like marijuana, hashish, heroin, cocaine, and LSD would fulfill this factor. Coffee, tea, tobacco, and betel do not have this effect, though, so there is no reason to include them here.

     - 關於哪些其他物質符合《四大教示》，也應納入此因素，存在一些爭議。由於《聖典》一再批評酒精，認為它會損害人的羞恥感，削弱人的辨識力，並可能使人神智不清——就像娑伽陀尊者所遭遇的那樣——因此，將這一戒條擴展到其他麻醉品、麻醉劑和致幻劑似乎也合情合理。因此，大麻、大麻樹脂、海洛因、古柯鹼和迷幻藥（LSD）等東西符合此因素。然而，咖啡、茶、菸草和檳榔不具有這種效果，因此沒有理由將它們納入此處。

   * - Perception as to whether a liquid counts as alcohol or liquor is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_). Thus a bhikkhu drinking champagne that he thinks to be carbonated apple juice *would* fall under this factor, regardless of his ignorance.

     - 對於某種液體是否屬於酒精或含酒精飲料的感知，並非此處的減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。因此，如果一位比丘喝了他認為是碳酸蘋果汁的香檳，那麼無論他是否無知，\ *都*\ 符合這一因素。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *drinking* as taking even as little as the tip of a blade of grass. Thus taking a small glass of wine, even though it might not be enough to make one drunk, would be more than enough to fulfill this factor.

     - 《經分別》將\ *飲用*\ 定義為哪怕只喝一小片草尖。因此，喝一小杯酒，即使不足以讓人醉，也足以滿足這項條件。

   * - The Vibhaṅga does not, however, indicate how offenses are to be counted here. According to the Commentary, the number of offenses involved in taking an alcoholic drink is determined by the number of separate sips. As for intoxicants taken by means other than sipping, each separate effort would count as an offense.

     - 然而，《經分別》並未指明此處如何計算犯戒次數。根據《義註》，飲酒的犯戒次數取決於單獨啜飲的次數。至於以啜飲以外的方式使用麻醉品，每次單獨努力都算作一次犯戒。
