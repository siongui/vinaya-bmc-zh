          *Should any bhikkhu give staple or non-staple food with his own hand to a naked ascetic, a male wanderer, or a female wanderer, it is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘親手給裸行者、男遊方者或女遊方者提供主食或副食，波逸提。*

   * - There are two origin stories here, the first being the more entertaining of the two:
     - 這裡有兩個起源故事，第一個是其中較有趣者：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time (a lot of) non-staple food accrued to the Community. Ven. Ānanda told this matter to the Blessed One, who said, “In that case, Ānanda, give the cakes to those who eat scraps.’”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「\ `爾時，（很多）副食歸屬於僧團所有。 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0122a03>`_\ 阿難尊者將此事稟告世尊。世尊說：『既然如此，阿難，就把餅給予那些吃剩飯的人。』」

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘As you say, venerable sir,’ Ven. Ānanda responded to the Blessed One. Then, having had those who eat scraps sit down in a line and giving a cake to each, he gave two cakes to a certain female wanderer, thinking they were one. The female wanderers around her said, “That monk is your lover.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『如你所說，世尊。』阿難達尊者回應世尊。然後，他讓那些吃剩飯的人坐下成一排，每人給一個餅。他給了一位女遊方者兩個餅，以為是一個。她周圍的女遊方者說：「那位沙門是你的情人。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘No, he’s not. He just gave me two cakes thinking they were one.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『不，他不是。他只是把兩個餅以為是一個給了我。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “A second time…. A third time, Ven. Ānanda, giving a cake to each, gave two cakes to that female wanderer, thinking they were one. The female wanderers around her said, “That monk is your lover.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「第二次……第三次，阿難尊者給每人一個餅，卻給了那位女遊方者兩個，以為是一個。她周圍的女遊方者說：『那位沙門是你的情人。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘No, he’s not. He just gave me two cakes thinking they were one.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『不，他不是。他只是把兩個餅以為是一個給了我。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “So—‘Lover!’ ‘Not a lover! (§)’—they kept squabbling.”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「所以——『情人！』『不是情人！（§）』——他們持續爭吵。」

   * - The second story, though, gives a better idea of the reason for the rule:
     - 不過，第二個故事更好地解釋了這條戒條的原因：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then a certain naked ascetic went to a distribution of food. A certain bhikkhu, having mashed some rice with a great deal of ghee, gave a large helping to the naked ascetic. So the naked ascetic, having received his alms, left. Another naked ascetic asked him, ‘Where, friend, did you get your alms?’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「後來，一位裸行者去食物分配處。一位比丘用大量酥油搗碎了一些米飯，給了這位裸行者一大份。這位裸行者受完施捨後便離開了。另一位裸行者問他：『朋友，你的施捨是從哪裡來的？』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘At a distribution of food by that shaveling householder, the Gotama monk.’”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『那位剃度的居士，喬達摩沙門，在食物分配處。』」

   * - This training rule is corollary to the preceding one. Other religions at the Buddha’s time observed the formalities of receiving food from their lay followers just as the bhikkhus did, and thus a bhikkhu who gave food in such a way to a mendicant ordained in another religion would be placing himself in the position of a lay follower of that religion, as the second origin story shows. An interesting point about this rule is that the Buddha formulated it at the request of Buddhist lay followers. Having overheard the naked ascetics’ conversation, they said to him, “Venerable sir, these adherents of other religions enjoy criticizing the Buddha… Dhamma… and Saṅgha. It would be good if the masters did not give to adherents of other religions with their own hands.”

     - 這條戒條與前一條戒條相輔相成。在佛陀時代，其他宗教也像比丘一樣，遵守著接受他們在家信眾食物的禮儀。因此，如果比丘以這種方式向其他宗教的托缽僧給予食物，就等於將自己置於該宗教的在家信眾的地位，正如第二個起源故事所示。這條戒條的一個有趣之處在於，佛陀是應佛教在家信眾的要求而制定的。他們無意中聽到裸行者的談話，便對佛陀說：「世尊，這些外教信徒喜歡批評佛……法……僧。如果大德們不親手將食物給予外教信徒就好了。」

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines the terms *naked ascetic* and *male or female wanderer* in such a way that they cover all people who have “gone forth” except for bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, female trainees, and male or female novices. Because “going forth” was how ordination was understood at that time, we can use the Great Standards at present to include anyone ordained in other religions—e.g., Catholic priests, Protestant ministers, Jewish rabbis, Muslim mullahs, etc.—under the factor of object here as well. Different Communities differ as to whether they would include people ordained in other Buddhist religions—such as Zen priests or Tibetan lamas—under this category as well.

     - 《經分別》對\ *裸行者*\ 和\ *男女遊方者*\ 的定義，涵蓋了除比丘、比丘尼、學法女（式叉摩那）以及男女沙彌之外的所有「出家」者。由於「出家」是當時對受戒的理解，我們如今可以運用《四大教示》，將其他宗教出家者（例如天主教神父、新教牧師、猶太教拉比、穆斯林毛拉等）也納入此處的對象因素。不同的僧團對於是否將其他佛教出家者（例如禪宗僧人或西藏喇嘛）納入此類也存在分歧。

   * - Perception as to whether a person would qualify as a naked ascetic or a male or female wanderer is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 對於某人是否真為裸行者或男女遊方者的感知在這裡並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - *Staple and non-staple food* here covers all edibles: juice drinks, tonics, and medicines as well as food, but not water or tooth-cleaning sticks. Staple and non-staple foods are grounds for a pācittiya; water and tooth-cleaning sticks, grounds for a dukkaṭa.

     - *主食和副食*\ 在此處涵蓋所有可食用物：果汁飲料、補品、藥物以及食物，但不包括水或齒木。主食和副食構成《波逸提》；水和齒木構成《突吉羅》。

   * - To *give* is defined as giving with the body, with something in contact with the body, or by means of letting go, as in the preceding rule.
     - *給予*\ 的定義是，用身體給予，用與身體接觸的某物給予，或透過放下來給予，就像前一條戒條一樣。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - To get someone else to give edible things, to give edible things by depositing them near (as in `NP 18`_), or to give ointments for external use entails no offense. The Commentary qualifies the first exemption by saying that the “someone else” must not be fully ordained. The New K/Sub-commentary points out that the last exemption was probably meant to apply to oils, which otherwise would come under “non-staple food” here.

     - 讓他人給予可食用物，或將可食用物放在附近給予（如\ `《捨墮》一八`_\ ），或施捨外用藥膏，均不構成犯戒。《義註》對第一項豁免進行了限定，指出「他人」不得受具足戒。新 K/《複註》指出，最後一項豁免可能適用於油類，否則油類在此處應歸入「副食」。

   * - *Summary: Handing food or medicine to a person ordained in another religion is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：向其他宗教出家者親手給予食物或藥物是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *Should any bhikkhu say to a bhikkhu, “Come, my friend, let’s enter the village or town for alms,” and then—whether or not he has had (food) given to him—dismiss him, saying, “Go away, my friend. I don’t like sitting or talking with you. I prefer sitting or talking alone”—doing it for just that reason and no other—it is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘對另一個比丘說，「來吧，我的朋友，我們進村或進城托缽」，然後——不管有沒有給予他食物——打發他走，說，「走開吧，我的朋友。我不喜歡和你坐在一起或說話。我更喜歡獨自坐著或說話」——如此做僅僅因為這個原因而沒有其他——波逸提。*

   * - The factors for the full offense here are four.
     - 這裡構成完全違犯的因素有四。

   * - *1) Object:* another bhikkhu.
     - *1）對象：*\ 另一位比丘。

   * - *2) Intention:* One wants to indulge in misconduct and does not want him to see it.
     - *2）意圖：*\ 想要沉溺於不當行為，卻又不想讓他看到。

   * - *3) Effort:* One dismisses him.
     - *3）努力：*\ 打發他走。

   * - *4) Result:* He leaves one’s range of hearing and sight.
     - *4）結果：*\ 他離開了自己的聽力和視力範圍。

   * - Although the rule mentions one specific situation—bhikkhus going for alms in a town or village—the non-offense clauses give no exemption for a bhikkhu who, wanting to indulge in misconduct, dismisses another bhikkhu while outside of a village or engaged in an activity other than going for alms. The commentaries notice this point and, reasonably, do not list the specific situation as a necessary factor for the offense. For this reason, the factors for this offense apply in any location and at any time of the day.

     - 雖然戒條提到了一種特殊情況——比丘在城鎮或村莊托缽——如果比丘想要沉溺於不當行為，在村莊之外或從事托缽以外的活動時打發另一位比丘走，不犯條款並未給予該比丘豁免。註釋書注意到了這一點，並且合理地沒有將特定情況列為構成此戒條犯戒的必要因素。因此，此戒條犯戒的因素適用於任何地點、任何時間。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya here; an unordained person (which for the purpose of this rule would include bhikkhunīs), grounds for a dukkaṭa. Perception as to whether a person is actually a bhikkhu is not a mitigating factor here. In other words, a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. An unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. *This pattern—three pācittiyas and three dukkaṭas—is repeated in all the rules where a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya, an unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa, and perception is not a mitigating factor.*

     - 《經分別》規定，比丘在此構成《波逸提》；而未受具足者（就本戒條而言，包括比丘尼）構成《突吉羅》。對某人是否為比丘的感知在此並非減輕懲罰的因素。換句話說，如果認為比丘是比丘，或認為他是未受具足戒者，或對此事存有疑問，則構成《波逸提》。如果認為未受具足戒者是比丘，或認為他是未受具足戒者，或對此事存有疑問，則構成《突吉羅》。\ *這種模式——三《波逸提》和三《突吉羅》——在比丘構成《波逸提》，未受具足戒者構成《突吉羅》，且感知不是減輕懲罰的因素的所有戒條中重複出現。*

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *misconduct* as laughing, playing, or sitting in private with a woman, or any other misbehavior of any sort. To dismiss the other person, ordained or not, for motives other than a desire to hide one’s own misconduct entails no offense. Examples of such motives given in the non-offense clauses are listed below.

     - 《經分別》將\ *不當行為*\ 定義為與女性私下嬉笑、玩耍、共坐，或任何其他不當行為。出於非為掩蓋自身不當行為的動機而打發他人走，不論該人是否受具足戒，均不構成犯戒。以下列舉了不犯條款中給予的此類動機範例。

   * - **Effort & result**
     - **努力及結果**

   * - To *dismiss* the other person means either to say outright for him/her to go away, or else to make remarks that will make him/her want to leave. The Commentary gives an example here—“Look at how this guy stands, sits, and looks around. He stands like a stump, sits like a dog, and looks about like a monkey”—but this would more likely come under `Pc 2`_.

     - *打發*\ 對方走意味著若非直接說出讓他/她走開，則是說些讓他/她想離開的話。《義註》在這裡舉了一個例子——「看看這傢伙站著、坐著，四處張望的樣子。他站著像個樹樁，坐著像條狗，看起來就像隻猴子。」——但這更有可能屬於\ `《波逸提》二`_\ 。

   * - The offenses here are as follows:
     - 此處的違犯如下：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          a dukkaṭa for speaking the words of dismissal;

     - .. container:: mx-2

          說了打發走的話，犯《突吉羅》；

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          a dukkaṭa when the other bhikkhu is leaving the range of hearing and sight; and

     - .. container:: mx-2

          當其他比丘離開聽力和視力範圍時，犯《突吉羅》；而且

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          a pācittiya when he has left.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          當他離開時，犯《波逸提》。

   * - The Commentary defines *range of hearing and range of sight* as twelve cubits, or six meters. If, however, there is a wall or a door within that distance, it says, that delimits the range.

     - 《義註》將\ *聽力範圍和視力範圍*\ 定義為十二肘尺，即六公尺。然而，如果在該距離內有一堵牆或一扇門，則該範圍就被劃定了。
