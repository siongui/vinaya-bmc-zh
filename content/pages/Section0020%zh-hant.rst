          *Should any bhikkhu give staple or non-staple food with his own hand to a naked ascetic, a male wanderer, or a female wanderer, it is to be confessed.*

          *如果任何比丘親手給裸行者、男遊方者或女遊方者提供主食或副食，波逸提。*

   * - There are two origin stories here, the first being the more entertaining of the two:
     - 這裡有兩個起源故事，第一個是其中較有趣者：

          “Now at that time (a lot of) non-staple food accrued to the Community. Ven. Ānanda told this matter to the Blessed One, who said, “In that case, Ānanda, give the cakes to those who eat scraps.’”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「\ `爾時，（很多）副食歸屬於僧團所有。 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0122a03>`_\ 阿難尊者將此事稟告世尊。世尊說：『既然如此，阿難，就把餅給予那些吃剩飯的人。』」

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘As you say, venerable sir,’ Ven. Ānanda responded to the Blessed One. Then, having had those who eat scraps sit down in a line and giving a cake to each, he gave two cakes to a certain female wanderer, thinking they were one. The female wanderers around her said, “That monk is your lover.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『如你所說，世尊。』阿難達尊者回應世尊。然後，他讓那些吃剩飯的人坐下成一排，每人給一個餅。他給了一位女遊方者兩個餅，以為是一個。她周圍的女遊方者說：「那位沙門是你的情人。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘No, he’s not. He just gave me two cakes thinking they were one.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『不，他不是。他只是把兩個餅以為是一個給了我。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “A second time…. A third time, Ven. Ānanda, giving a cake to each, gave two cakes to that female wanderer, thinking they were one. The female wanderers around her said, “That monk is your lover.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「第二次……第三次，阿難尊者給每人一個餅，卻給了那位女遊方者兩個，以為是一個。她周圍的女遊方者說：『那位沙門是你的情人。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “‘No, he’s not. He just gave me two cakes thinking they were one.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「『不，他不是。他只是把兩個餅以為是一個給了我。』

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “So—‘Lover!’ ‘Not a lover! (§)’—they kept squabbling.”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「所以——『情人！』『不是情人！（§）』——他們持續爭吵。」
