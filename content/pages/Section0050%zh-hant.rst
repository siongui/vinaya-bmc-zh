       **Rains-residence**

     - **雨安居**

   * - Well before the Buddha’s time there was a custom in India that wanderers would stay in place for the rainy season, both to avoid having to negotiate muddy roads and to avoid trampling plants. Bhikkhus in the early years of the Buddha’s teaching career were criticized by the Jains for not observing this custom, so the Buddha gave his permission for them to stop their wandering for three months of the Rains. Later he imposed a penalty for not observing this custom.

     - 早在佛陀時代之前，印度就有一個習俗，就是遊方者會在雨季待在原地，以避免行走泥濘的道路和踩踏植物。在佛陀早期的教化生涯中，比丘們因不遵守這項習俗而受到耆那教徒的批評，於是佛陀允許他們在雨季三個月內停止遊方。後來，他對不遵守這項習俗施加懲罰。

       **Periods of residence**

     - **安居時段**

   * - Because the rainy season in South Asia is roughly four months, bhikkhus are allowed to choose between two periods of Rains-residence: the first, starting the day after the full moon of the month of Asāḷhi (roughly July); and the second, starting the day after the following full moon. At present, the first Rains-residence starts on the full moon in July, or the second if there are two. Why the Buddha formulated two periods of Rains-residence, the Canon does not say. From the Commentary’s discussion of `Mv.II.21.4`_, it would appear that if one enters the first Rains and then, for one reason or another, “breaks” the Rains (see below) within the first month, one would still be eligible to enter the second Rains so as to receive the privileges contingent on its successful completion.

     - 由於南亞的雨季大約有四個月，比丘們可以在兩個雨安居時段之間進行選擇：前雨安居，從 Asāḷhi 月（大約是七月）滿月的次日開始；後雨安居，從下一個滿月的次日開始。目前，前雨安居從七月的滿月開始，如果有兩個滿月，則從第二個開始。至於佛陀為何要訂定兩個雨安居時段，《聖典》中並未說明。從《義註》對\ `《大品》.二.21.4`_ 的討論來看，如果入前雨安居，然後因為某種原因在第一個月內「中斷」了雨安居（見下文），仍然有資格入後雨安居，並在圓滿完成之後獲得方便利益。
