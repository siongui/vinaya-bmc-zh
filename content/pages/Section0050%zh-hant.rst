       **Rains-residence**

     - **雨安居**

   * - Well before the Buddha’s time there was a custom in India that wanderers would stay in place for the rainy season, both to avoid having to negotiate muddy roads and to avoid trampling plants. Bhikkhus in the early years of the Buddha’s teaching career were criticized by the Jains for not observing this custom, so the Buddha gave his permission for them to stop their wandering for three months of the Rains. Later he imposed a penalty for not observing this custom.

     - 早在佛陀時代之前，印度就有一個習俗，就是遊方者會在雨季待在原地，以避免行走泥濘的道路和踩踏植物。在佛陀早期的教化生涯中，比丘們因不遵守這項習俗而受到耆那教徒的批評，於是佛陀允許他們在雨季三個月內停止遊方。後來，他對不遵守這項習俗施加懲罰。

       **Periods of residence**

     - **安居時段**

   * - Because the rainy season in South Asia is roughly four months, bhikkhus are allowed to choose between two periods of Rains-residence: the first, starting the day after the full moon of the month of Asāḷhi (roughly July); and the second, starting the day after the following full moon. At present, the first Rains-residence starts on the full moon in July, or the second if there are two. Why the Buddha formulated two periods of Rains-residence, the Canon does not say. From the Commentary’s discussion of `Mv.II.21.4`_, it would appear that if one enters the first Rains and then, for one reason or another, “breaks” the Rains (see below) within the first month, one would still be eligible to enter the second Rains so as to receive the privileges contingent on its successful completion.

     - 由於南亞的雨季大約有四個月，比丘們可以在兩個雨安居時段之間進行選擇：前雨安居，從 Asāḷhi 月（大約是七月）滿月的次日開始；後雨安居，從下一個滿月的次日開始。目前，前雨安居從七月的滿月開始，如果有兩個滿月，則從第二個開始。至於佛陀為何要訂定兩個雨安居時段，《聖典》中並未說明。從《義註》對\ `《大品》.二.21.4`_ 的討論來看，如果入前雨安居，然後因為某種原因在第一個月內「中斷」了雨安居（見下文），仍然有資格入後雨安居，並在圓滿完成之後獲得方便利益。

   * - In the Buddha’s time, the determination of the lunar calendar was one of the responsibilities of the government in each kingdom or republic. Thus, to avoid controversy, the Buddha allowed that the wishes of kings be respected in this matter: If a king wanted to postpone the designation of the Asāḷhi full moon another month, bhikkhus were allowed to comply. (The rule coming from this origin story is stated in more general terms—“I allow that kings be complied with”—showing the general principle that we noted under `Chapter 7`_, that the Buddha was not so foolish as to try to legislate for kings. The Commentary notes, however, that this principle applies only in matters in which the king’s wish is in line with the Dhamma. No one, it says, should be complied with in matters where their wishes are not in line with the Dhamma.) At present, the governments of only a few countries concern themselves with calculating the lunar calendar for the sake of the general population. In other countries this point is not an issue, and the bhikkhus are free to calculate the lunar calendar without regard to the government’s calculations.

     - 在佛陀時代，制定陰曆是每個王國或共和國政府的職責之一。因此，為了避免爭議，佛陀允許在此事上尊重國王的意願：如果國王想將 Asāḷhi 滿月的指定推遲一個月，比丘們被允許遵從。（源自此起源故事的戒條以更普遍的措辭表達——「我允許國王被遵從」——體現了我們在\ `第七章`_\ 中提到的普遍原則，即佛陀不會愚蠢到試圖為國王立法。然而，《義註》指出，這一原則僅適用於國王意願符合佛法的事上。它說，如果有人的意願與佛法不符，就不應該在該事上遵從他。）目前，只有少數國家的政府會為了民眾而計算陰曆。在其他國家，這一點並不成問題，比丘們可以自由地計算陰曆，而不必考慮政府的計算方式。

       **Entering for the Rains**

     - **入雨安居**

   * - The first day of the Rains-residence is when lodgings in a monastery are assigned for the duration of the Rains, so the Commentary recommends that a bhikkhu planning to spend the Rains in another monastery should start heading there a month before the start of the Rains so as not to inconvenience the assigner of lodgings and other bhikkhus there. As for bhikkhus planning to stay on in the monastery where they are already residing, they should spend the month before the beginning of the Rains preparing any worn-down buildings so that those who come for the Rains will study and/or practice meditation in comfort. The assigner of lodgings should assign lodgings for the Rains at dawn of the day the Rains begins. If other bhikkhus come later in the day and there are no extra spaces for them, they should be told that the lodgings have been assigned and that they should go to other lodgings, such as the foot of a tree. (What this means, apparently, is that they should enter the second Rains somewhere else, as the Canon contains a rule against entering the Rains in anything less than a proper dwelling. See below.)

     - 雨安居的第一天是寺院分配雨安居住所的日子，因此《義註》建議，計劃在其他寺院度過雨安居的比丘應在雨安居開始前一個月前往該寺院，以免給分配住所的人和寺院的其他比丘帶來不便。至於計劃繼續留在現居寺院的比丘，他們應在雨安居開始前一個月整修任何破舊的建築，以便前來雨安居的人能夠舒適地學習和/或修行。分配住所的人應在雨安居開始當天黎明分配雨安居住所。如果其他比丘當天晚些時候到來，並且沒有多餘的空間，應告知他們住所已分配完畢，他們應前往其他住所，例如樹下。（顯然，這意味著他們應該在其他地方入後雨安居，因為《聖典》裡戒條規定，不得在非合適住所入雨安居。見下文。）
