   * - This term means “indefinite.” The rules in this section do not assign definite or fixed penalties, but instead give procedures by which the Community may pass judgment when a bhikkhu in uncertain circumstances is accused of having committed an offense. There are two training rules here.

     - 這個字的意思是「不定」。本節的戒條並沒有指定明確或固定的懲罰，而是給出了當比丘在不確定的情況下被指控犯戒時，僧團可以做出判決的程序。這裡有兩條學處。

          *Should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a woman on a seat secluded enough to lend itself (to sexual intercourse), so that a female lay follower whose word can be trusted, having seen (them), might describe it as constituting any of three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—then the bhikkhu, acknowledging having sat (there), may be dealt with in line with any of the three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—or he may be dealt with in line with whichever case the female lay follower whose word can be trusted described. This case is indefinite.*

          *如果任何比丘與一名女人私密地單獨坐在足夠（進行性交的）僻靜座位上，以至於一位言詞可信的近事女，在見過（他們）之後，可能會描述它構成了以下三種情況任何一種——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——比丘承認坐了（那裡），可以按照三種情況——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——中的任何一種來處理，或者依言詞可信的近事女所說來予以處理他。此情況不定。*

   * - *Woman* here means a female human being, “even one born that very day, all the more an older one.” *To sit* also includes lying down. Whether the bhikkhu sits down when the woman is already seated, or the woman sits down when he is already seated, or both sit down at the same time, makes no difference here.

     - 這裡的「女人」是指女性人類，「即使是當天出生的，更不用說更年長的」。\ *坐*\ 也包括躺著。無論比丘在女人已經坐下時坐下，還是當他已經坐下時，女人坐下，或者兩者同時坐下，在這裡都沒有區別。

   * - *Private* means private to the eye and private to the ear. Two people are sitting in a place private to the eye when no one else is near enough to see if they wink, raise their eyebrows, or nod (§). They are in a place private to the ear when no one else is near enough to hear what they say in a normal voice (§). *A secluded seat* is one behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush, or anything at all that would afford them enough privacy to engage in sexual intercourse.

     - *私密*\ 意味著視線私密、聞聲私密。兩個人坐在一個視線私密的地方，沒有其他人離得足夠近，可以看到他們是否眨眼、揚眉或點頭（§）。當沒有其他人離得夠近，無法聽清楚他們以正常聲音說話時，他們就處於一個聞聲私密的地方（§）。\ *僻靜的座位*\ 是指牆後、一扇緊閉的門、一大片灌木叢或任何能為他們提供足夠隱私以進行性交的地方。
