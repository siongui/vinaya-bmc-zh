   * - This term means “indefinite.” The rules in this section do not assign definite or fixed penalties, but instead give procedures by which the Community may pass judgment when a bhikkhu in uncertain circumstances is accused of having committed an offense. There are two training rules here.

     - 這個字的意思是「不定」。本節的戒條並沒有指定明確或固定的懲罰，而是給出了當比丘在不確定的情況下被指控犯戒時，僧團可以做出判決的程序。這裡有兩條學處。

          *Should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a woman on a seat secluded enough to lend itself (to sexual intercourse), so that a female lay follower whose word can be trusted, having seen (them), might describe it as constituting any of three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—then the bhikkhu, acknowledging having sat (there), may be dealt with in line with any of the three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—or he may be dealt with in line with whichever case the female lay follower whose word can be trusted described. This case is indefinite.*

          *如果任何比丘與一名女人私密地單獨坐在足夠（進行性交的）僻靜座位上，以至於一位言詞可信的優婆夷，在見過（他們）之後，可能會描述它構成了以下三種情況任何一種——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——比丘承認坐了（那裡），可以按照三種情況——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——中的任何一種來處理，或者依言詞可信的優婆夷所說來予以處理他。此情況不定。*

   * - *Woman* here means a female human being, “even one born that very day, all the more an older one.” *To sit* also includes lying down. Whether the bhikkhu sits down when the woman is already seated, or the woman sits down when he is already seated, or both sit down at the same time, makes no difference here.

     - 這裡的「女人」是指女性人類，「即使是當天出生的，更不用說更年長的」。\ *坐*\ 也包括躺著。無論比丘在女人已經坐下時坐下，還是當他已經坐下時，女人坐下，或者兩者同時坐下，在這裡都沒有區別。

   * - *Private* means private to the eye and private to the ear. Two people are sitting in a place private to the eye when no one else is near enough to see if they wink, raise their eyebrows, or nod (§). They are in a place private to the ear when no one else is near enough to hear what they say in a normal voice (§). *A secluded seat* is one behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush, or anything at all that would afford them enough privacy to engage in sexual intercourse.

     - *私密*\ 意味著視線私密、聞聲私密。兩個人坐在一個視線私密的地方，沒有其他人離得足夠近，可以看到他們是否眨眼、揚眉或點頭（§）。當沒有其他人離得夠近，無法聽清楚他們以正常聲音說話時，他們就處於一個聞聲私密的地方（§）。\ *僻靜的座位*\ 是指牆後、一扇緊閉的門、一大片灌木叢或任何能為他們提供足夠隱私以進行性交的地方。

   * - For a bhikkhu to sit in such a place with a woman can be in itself a breach of `Pc 44`_ (see the explanations for that rule) and affords the opportunity for breaking `Pr 1`_ and `Sg 1`_, 2, 3, & 4 as well—which is why this case is called indefinite.

     - 對於比丘來說，與女人坐在這樣的地方，本身就違反了\ `《波逸提》四四`_\ （參見該戒條的解釋），也提供了違反\ `《波羅夷》一`_\ 和\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 、二、三和四的機會——這就是為什麼這種情況稱為不定。

   * - If a trustworthy female lay follower happens to see a bhikkhu with a woman in such circumstances, she may inform the Community and charge him on the basis of what she has seen. *Female lay follower* here means one who has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. *Trustworthy* means that she is at least a stream-winner. Even if she is not a stream-winner, the Community may choose to investigate the case anyway; but if she is, they have to. The texts do not discuss cases in which a man is making the charge but, given the low legal status of women in the Buddha’s time, it seems reasonable to infer that if a woman’s word was given such weight, the same would hold true for a man’s. In other words, if he is a stream-winner, the Community has to investigate the case. If he isn’t, they are free to handle the case or not, as they see fit.

     - 如果一位值得信賴的優婆夷碰巧看到一位比丘與一名女人處於這種情況，她可以通知僧團，並根據她所看到的情況向他提出指控。這裡的\ *優婆夷*\ 是指已經皈依佛、法、僧的人。\ *值得信賴*\ 意味著她至少是一位入流者。即使她不是入流者，僧團也可選擇調查此案；但如果她是，他們就必須這麼做。這些文獻沒有討論男性提出指控的案例，但鑑於佛陀時代女性的法律地位較低，似乎可以合理地推斷，如果女性的話受到如此重視，那麼同樣的情況也適用於男性。換句話說，如果他是入流者，僧團就必須調查此案。如果他不是，他們可以按照他們認為合適的方式自由處理或不處理此案。

   * - The wording of the rule suggests that once the matter is investigated and the bhikkhu in question has stated his side of the story, the bhikkhus are free to judge the case either in line with what he admits to having done or in line with the trustworthy female lay follower’s charge. In other words, if his admission and her charge are at variance, they may decide which side seems to be telling the truth and impose a penalty—or no penalty—on the bhikkhu as they see fit.

     - 本戒條的措辭表明，一旦事件得到調查並且有關比丘陳述了他的說法，比丘們可以自由地根據他承認的行為或根據值得信賴的優婆夷來判斷案件。換句話說，如果他的承認和她的指控不一致，他們可以決定哪一方似乎說的是實話，並根據他們認為合適的方式對比丘施加懲罰——或不施加懲罰。

   * - The Vibhaṅga, however, states that they may deal with him only in line with what he admits to having done. The Commentary offers no explanation for this point aside from saying that in uncertain cases things are not always as they seem, citing as example the story of an arahant who was wrongly charged by another bhikkhu of having broken `Pc 44`_.

     - 然而，\ `《經分別》規定，他們只能根據他承認的行為來處理他 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_003#0265a14>`_\ 。《義註》對此沒有提供任何解釋，只是說，在不確定的情況下，事情並不總是像看上去的那樣，並引用了一位阿羅漢的故事作為例子，他被另一位比丘錯誤地指控違反了\ `《波逸提》四四`_\ 。
