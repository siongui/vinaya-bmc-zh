   * - This term means “indefinite.” The rules in this section do not assign definite or fixed penalties, but instead give procedures by which the Community may pass judgment when a bhikkhu in uncertain circumstances is accused of having committed an offense. There are two training rules here.

     - 這個字的意思是「不定」。本節的戒條並沒有指定明確或固定的懲罰，而是給出了當比丘在不確定的情況下被指控犯戒時，僧團可以做出判決的程序。這裡有兩條學處。

          *Should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a woman on a seat secluded enough to lend itself (to sexual intercourse), so that a female lay follower whose word can be trusted, having seen (them), might describe it as constituting any of three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—then the bhikkhu, acknowledging having sat (there), may be dealt with in line with any of the three cases—entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession—or he may be dealt with in line with whichever case the female lay follower whose word can be trusted described. This case is indefinite.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘與一名女人私密地單獨坐在足夠（進行性交的）僻靜座位上，以至於一位言詞可信的優婆夷，在見過（他們）之後，可能會描述它構成了以下三種情況任何一種——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——比丘承認坐了（那裡），可以按照三種情況——《波羅夷》、《僧殘》、或《波逸提》——中的任何一種來處理，或者依言詞可信的優婆夷所說來予以處理他。此情況不定。*

   * - *Woman* here means a female human being, “even one born that very day, all the more an older one.” *To sit* also includes lying down. Whether the bhikkhu sits down when the woman is already seated, or the woman sits down when he is already seated, or both sit down at the same time, makes no difference here.

     - 這裡的「女人」是指女性人類，「即使是當天出生的，更不用說更年長的」。\ *坐*\ 也包括躺著。無論比丘在女人已經坐下時坐下，還是當他已經坐下時，女人坐下，或者兩者同時坐下，在這裡都沒有區別。

   * - *Private* means private to the eye and private to the ear. Two people are sitting in a place private to the eye when no one else is near enough to see if they wink, raise their eyebrows, or nod (§). They are in a place private to the ear when no one else is near enough to hear what they say in a normal voice (§). *A secluded seat* is one behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush, or anything at all that would afford them enough privacy to engage in sexual intercourse.

     - *私密*\ 意味著視線私密、聞聲私密。兩個人坐在一個視線私密的地方，沒有其他人離得足夠近，可以看到他們是否眨眼、揚眉或點頭（§）。當沒有其他人離得夠近，無法聽清楚他們以正常聲音說話時，他們就處於一個聞聲私密的地方（§）。\ *僻靜的座位*\ 是指牆後、一扇緊閉的門、一大片灌木叢或任何能為他們提供足夠隱私以進行性交的地方。

   * - For a bhikkhu to sit in such a place with a woman can be in itself a breach of `Pc 44`_ (see the explanations for that rule) and affords the opportunity for breaking `Pr 1`_ and `Sg 1`_, 2, 3, & 4 as well—which is why this case is called indefinite.

     - 對於比丘來說，與女人坐在這樣的地方，本身就違反了\ `《波逸提》四四`_\ （參見該戒條的解釋），也提供了違反\ `《波羅夷》一`_\ 和\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 、二、三和四的機會——這就是為什麼這種情況稱為不定。

   * - If a trustworthy female lay follower happens to see a bhikkhu with a woman in such circumstances, she may inform the Community and charge him on the basis of what she has seen. *Female lay follower* here means one who has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. *Trustworthy* means that she is at least a stream-winner. Even if she is not a stream-winner, the Community may choose to investigate the case anyway; but if she is, they have to. The texts do not discuss cases in which a man is making the charge but, given the low legal status of women in the Buddha’s time, it seems reasonable to infer that if a woman’s word was given such weight, the same would hold true for a man’s. In other words, if he is a stream-winner, the Community has to investigate the case. If he isn’t, they are free to handle the case or not, as they see fit.

     - 如果一位值得信賴的優婆夷碰巧看到一位比丘與一名女人處於這種情況，她可以通知僧團，並根據她所看到的情況向他提出指控。這裡的\ *優婆夷*\ 是指已經皈依佛、法、僧的人。\ *值得信賴*\ 意味著她至少是一位入流者。即使她不是入流者，僧團也可選擇調查此案；但如果她是，他們就必須這麼做。這些文獻沒有討論男性提出指控的案例，但鑑於佛陀時代女性的法律地位較低，似乎可以合理地推斷，如果女性的話受到如此重視，那麼同樣的情況也適用於男性。換句話說，如果他是入流者，僧團就必須調查此案。如果他不是，他們可以按照他們認為合適的方式自由處理或不處理此案。

   * - The wording of the rule suggests that once the matter is investigated and the bhikkhu in question has stated his side of the story, the bhikkhus are free to judge the case either in line with what he admits to having done or in line with the trustworthy female lay follower’s charge. In other words, if his admission and her charge are at variance, they may decide which side seems to be telling the truth and impose a penalty—or no penalty—on the bhikkhu as they see fit.

     - 本戒條的措辭表明，一旦事件得到調查並且有關比丘陳述了他的說法，比丘們可以自由地根據他承認的行為或根據值得信賴的優婆夷來判斷案件。換句話說，如果他的承認和她的指控不一致，他們可以決定哪一方似乎說的是實話，並根據他們認為合適的方式對比丘施加懲罰——或不施加懲罰。

   * - The Vibhaṅga, however, states that they may deal with him only in line with what he admits to having done. The Commentary offers no explanation for this point aside from saying that in uncertain cases things are not always as they seem, citing as example the story of an arahant who was wrongly charged by another bhikkhu of having broken `Pc 44`_.

     - 然而，\ `《經分別》規定，他們只能根據他承認的行為來處理他 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_003#0265a14>`_\ 。《義註》對此沒有提供任何解釋，只是說，在不確定的情況下，事情並不總是像看上去的那樣，並引用了一位阿羅漢的故事作為例子，他被另一位比丘錯誤地指控違反了\ `《波逸提》四四`_\ 。

   * - Actually, the Vibhaṅga in departing from the wording of the rule is simply following the general guidelines given in `As 4`_ and the Khandhakas for handling accusations. Apparently what happened was that this rule and the following one were formulated early on. Then `As 4`_—the principle of imposing an offense on a bhikkhu only in line with what he admits to having done—was formulated. This left a conflict. Which was to take precedence: these Ay rules, or `As 4`_? Later still, when the general guidelines were formulated for dealing with accusations, some group-of-six bhikkhus abused the system to impose penalties on innocent bhikkhus they didn’t like (`Mv.IX.3.1`_), so the Buddha formulated a number of checks to prevent the system from working against the innocent. One of those checks, in effect, was to give precedence to `As 4`_, a decision that the Vibhaṅga is following here.

     - 事實上，《經分別》偏離戒條的措辭只是遵循\ `《滅諍》四`_\ 和《犍度》中給出的處理指控的一般準則。顯然，本戒條和下一條戒條是很早就制定的。然後制定了\ `《滅諍》四`_\ ——僅根據比丘承認的行為來對他施加罪行的原則。這就留下了衝突。哪個優先：這些《不定》戒條，還是\ `《滅諍》四`_\ ？再後來，當制定處理指控的一般準則時，一些六群比丘濫用這一制度，對他們不喜歡的無辜比丘施加懲罰（\ `《大品》.九.3.1`_\ ），因此佛陀制定了一些檢查以防止系統對無辜者起作用。實際上，其中一項檢查是優先考慮\ `《滅諍》四`_\ ，這是《經分別》在此遵循的決定。

   * - We will cover the guidelines in detail under the adhikaraṇa-samatha rules in `Chapter 11`_, but here we may note a few of their more important features.
     - 我們將在\ `第十一章`_\ 中詳細介紹滅諍戒條下的指南，但在這裡我們可以注意到它們的一些更重要的特徵。

   * - If Bhikkhu X wants to charge Bhikkhu Y with an offense, he must first meet privately with Y, as explained under `Sg 8`_. If the issue cannot be settled privately in this way, then it has to go to a formal meeting of the Community. Once the case reaches this stage, one of only three verdicts can settle it: that the accused is innocent, that he was insane at the time he committed the offense (and so absolved of guilt), or that he is not only guilty as charged but—for having dragged out his confession to this point—also deserves a further-punishment transaction (`Cv.IV.14.27-29`_), which is the same as a censure transaction (Cv.IV.11-12).

     - 如果比丘 X 想要指控比丘 Y 犯戒，他必須先與 Y 私下會面，如\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 所述。如果問題不能以這種方式私下解決，則必須提交僧團正式會議。一旦案件到達此階段，只有三個判決之一可以解決這個問題：被指控者無罪，他在犯戒時精神錯亂（因此無罪），或者他不僅有罪，而且，由於他的坦承拖延到了這個地步，他還應該受到罪處所(覓罪相)羯磨（\ `《小品》.四.14.27-29`_\ ），這與訶責羯磨（\ `《小品》.四.11-12`_\ ）相同。

   * - When the Community meets, both the accused and the accuser must be present, and both must agree to the case’s being heard by that particular group. (If the original accuser is a lay person, one of the bhikkhus is to take up the charge.) The accused is then asked to state his version of the story and is to be dealt with in accordance with what he admits to having done (`Mv.IX.6.1-4`_). `Cv.IV.14.29`_ shows that the other bhikkhus are not to take his first statement at face value. They should press and cross-examine him until they are all satisfied that he is telling the truth, and only then may they pass one of the three verdicts mentioned above.

     - 當僧團開會時，被指控者和指控者都必須出席，並且雙方都必須同意該案件由該特定群體審理。（如果原告是在家人，則由一名比丘承擔指控。）然後，被指控者被要求陳述他的故事版本，並根據他承認的行為進行處理（\ `《大品》.九.6.1-4`_\ ）。\ `《小品》.四.14.29`_\ 顯示其他比丘不要相信他的最先陳述的表面價值。他們應該對他進行追問和盤問，直到他們都確信他說的是實話，然後才能通過上述三個判決之一。

   * - If necessary, they should be prepared to spend many hours in the meeting to arrive at a unanimous decision, for if they cannot come to a unanimous agreement, the case has to be left as unsettled, which is a very bad question mark to leave hovering over the communal life. The Commentary to `Sg 8`_ suggests that if one side or the other seems unreasonably stubborn, the senior bhikkhus should lead the group in long periods of chanting to wear down the stubborn side.

     - 如果有必要，他們應該準備好在會議上花很多時間來達成一致決定，因為如果他們不能達成一致意見，案件就只能懸而未決，在僧團生活中留下一個非常糟糕的問號。\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 的《義註》建議，如果一方或另一方看起來不合理地頑固，資深比丘應該帶領團體長時間念誦，以磨滅頑固的一方。

   * - If, in the course of the interrogation, Y admits to an action that constitutes an offense but he refuses to see it as an offense (`Mv.IX.1.3`_; Cv.XI.1.10), the case is not settled. However, this much of an admission allows the Community, if it sees fit, to suspend him from the Saṅgha at large (see `BMC2, Chapter 20`_) until he sees the error of his ways and is willing to undergo the penalty for the offense.

     - 如果在審訊過程中，Y 承認構成犯戒的行為，但他拒絕將其視為犯戒（\ `《大品》.九.1.3`_\ ；\ `《小品》.十一.1.10`_\ ），則案件未結案。然而，如此多的承認允許僧團在認為合適的情況下在整個僧伽中舉罪他（參見\ `《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章`_\ ），直到他看到自己的錯誤並願意接受犯戒的懲罰。
