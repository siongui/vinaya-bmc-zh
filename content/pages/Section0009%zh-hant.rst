   * - The first rule in the Pāṭimokkha opens with the statement that it—and, by extension, every other rule in the Pāṭimokkha—applies to all bhikkhus who have not disrobed by renouncing the training and returning to the lay life. Thus the Vibhaṅga begins its explanations by discussing what does and does not count as a valid act of disrobing. Because this is, in effect, the escape clause for all the rules, I am discussing it first as a separate chapter, for if a bhikkhu disrobes in an invalid manner, he still counts as a bhikkhu and is subject to the rules whether he realizes it or not. If he then were to break any of the pārājika rules, he would be disqualified from ever becoming a bhikkhu again in this lifetime.

     - 《波羅提木叉》的第一條戒條一開始就聲明，它——以及由此推及的《波羅提木叉》中的所有其他戒條——適用於所有尚未還俗捨戒，回到在家生活的比丘。因此，《經分別》透過討論什麼算是有效及無效的還俗行為來開始其解釋。因為這實際上是所有戒條的豁免條款，所以我首先將其作為一個單獨的章節來討論，因為如果比丘以無效的方式還俗，他仍然算是比丘，並且無論他是否意識到，他仍然受到戒條的約束。如果他違反任何《波羅夷》戒條，他這一生將失去再次成為比丘的資格。

   * - To disrobe, a bhikkhu with firm intent states in the presence of a witness words to the effect that he is renouncing the training. The validity of the act depends on four factors:

     - 為了還俗，一位比丘帶著堅定的意圖在見證人面前聲明他捨戒。該行為的有效性取決於四個因素：

   * - 1. The bhikkhu’s state of mind.
     - 1. 比丘的精神狀態。

   * - 2. His intention.
     - 2. 他的意圖。

   * - 3. His statement.
     - 3. 他的聲明。

   * - 4. The witness to his statement.
     - 4. 他的聲明的見證人。
