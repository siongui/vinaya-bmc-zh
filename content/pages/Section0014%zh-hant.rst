          *如果任何比丘接受金銀，或令接受金銀，或同意將其存放（在他附近），則該金銀將被捨出並懺悔。*

   * - As mentioned under `NP 10`_, one of the purposes of this rule is to relieve a bhikkhu of the burden of ownership that comes as the result of accepting gifts of money or having them accepted in one’s name. The discourses contain passages, though, indicating other purposes for this rule as well:

     - 正如\ `《捨墮》十`_\ 中所提到的，本戒條的目的之一是減輕比丘因接受金錢布施或令其以自己的名義接受而產生的所有權負擔。不過，經文中所包含的段落也顯示了本戒條的其他目的：

          “For anyone for whom gold and silver are allowable, the five strings of sensuality are also allowable. For anyone for whom the five strings of sensuality are allowable, gold and silver are allowable (reading *yassa pañca kāmaguṇā kappanti tassa-pi jātarūpa-rajataṁ kappati* with the Thai edition). That you can unequivocally recognize as not the quality of a contemplative, not the quality of one of the Sakyan sons.”—`SN 42:10`_

          “Bhikkhus, there are these four obscurations of the sun and moon, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? Clouds… Fog…. Smoke and dust… Rāhu, the king of the asuras (believed to be the cause of an eclipse) is an obscuration, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle…. In the same way, there are four obscurations of contemplatives and brahmans, obscured by which some contemplatives and brahmans don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? There are some contemplatives and brahmans who… do not refrain from drinking alcohol and fermented liquor… who do not refrain from sexual intercourse… who do not refrain from accepting gold and silver… who do not refrain from wrong livelihood…. Because of these obscurations, some brahmans and contemplatives… covered with darkness, slaves to craving, led on, swell the terrible charnel ground, grab at further becoming.”—`AN 4:50`_

          「諸比丘，日月有四種障蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？雲……霧……煙塵……羅睺，阿修羅之王（據信是日食的原因）是遮蔽物，被它遮蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝……。同樣地，沙門和婆羅門也有四種障蔽，有些沙門和婆羅門被這四種障蔽所遮蔽，不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？有沙門、婆羅門……不遠離飲酒及發酵飲料……不遠離淫欲法……不遠離接受金銀……不遠離邪命……。由於這些障蔽，有些婆羅門和沙門…被黑暗所籠罩，成為貪愛的奴隸，被牽引，擴大了可怖的墳場，執取後有。」—`《增支部》4:50經`_

   * - Bhikkhus, in abandoning the use of money, make real their abandonment of worldly pursuits and show others by example that the struggle for wealth is not the true way to find happiness.

     - 比丘們放棄使用金錢，就真正放棄了世俗的追求，並以身作則向他人表明，為財富而奮鬥並不是尋找幸福的真正方法。

   * - The factors for an offense under this rule are two: object and effort. However, because “object” is defined in one way for the first two actions stated in the rule, and in another way for the third, it seems best to analyze this rule as covering two separate but related offenses.

     - 根據本戒條，犯戒的因素有兩個：對象和努力。然而，由於「對象」以一種方式定義為戒條中規定的前兩種行為，而第三種行為則以另一種方式定義，因此似乎最好將本戒條分析為涵蓋兩種獨立但相關的犯戒。

   * - In the first offense the factors are:
     - 在第一種犯戒中，因素是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver.
     - *1）對象：*\金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One accepts or gets someone else to accept it.
     - *2）努力：*\接受或讓別人接受它。

   * - In the second offense they are:
     - 在第二種犯戒中，他們是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver intended for one.
     - *1）對象：*\供使用的金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One consents to its being placed down next to one.
     - *2）努力：*\同意將其放在旁邊。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *gold* so as to include anything made of gold. *Silver* it defines to cover coins made of silver, copper, wood, or lac, or whatever is used as a currency. The Commentary adds such examples as bones, pieces of hide, fruit, and seeds of trees used as currency, whether they have been stamped with a figure or not. At present, the term would include coins and paper currency, as well as money orders and cashiers checks not made out to a specific payee, as these meet all three requirements of a currency: (1) They are a generally accepted medium of exchange; (2) they are of standard recognized value; and (3) they are presentable by any bearer. The following items, because they do not fulfill all three of these requirements, would not count as “silver” under this rule: money orders and cashier’s checks made out to a specific payee; personal checks and travelers’ checks; credit cards and debit cards; gift cards, phone cards, frequent flyer miles; food stamps; and promissory notes.

     - 《經分別》對\ *金*\的定義\ `包括所有黃金製成的東西`_。它定義的「\ *銀*\」\ `包括由銀、銅、木頭、樹膠或任何用作貨幣的物質製成的硬幣`_。《義註》添加了用作貨幣的骨頭、獸皮碎片、水果和樹種等例子，無論它們是否帶有數字印記。目前，該術語包括硬幣和紙幣，以及未開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票，因為它們滿足貨幣的所有三個要求：（1）它們是普遍接受的交換媒介；（2）具有標準認可價值；（3）任何持有者均可出示。以下物品，因為不符合所有這三個要求，因此根據本戒條不能算作「銀」：開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票；個人支票和旅行支票；信用卡和金融卡；禮品卡、電話卡、飛行常客哩程；食品券；和\ `期票（本票）`_\。

   * - Because the word *silver* here functionally means “money,” that is how I will translate it for the remainder of the discussion of this rule.
     - 因為這裡的“銀”這個詞在功能上意味著“金錢”，所以我將在本戒條的其餘討論中對其進行翻譯。

   * - The Vibhaṅga indicates that perception is not a mitigating factor in either offense. Thus if a bhikkhu receives gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else—as when accepting a closed envelope not knowing that it contains money, or consenting to a bolt of cloth’s being placed near him, unaware that money has been placed inside it—he commits the full offense all the same. The same holds true if he is in doubt about what the envelope or bolt of cloth contains. This may seem a harsh penalty for a bhikkhu acting in complete innocence, but we must remember that, having received the money even unknowingly, he is now in possession of it and must dispose of it in a proper way. The protocols under this rule give directions for precisely how to do that.

     - 《經分別》指出，感知並不是這兩種犯戒的減輕因素。因此，如果比丘收到黃金或金錢，即使他將其視為其他東西，例如當他接受一個封閉的信封時，並不知道裡面裝有金錢，或者同意將一塊布匹放在他附近，但不知道裡面已經放入金錢了，他仍然完全違犯此戒。如果他對信封或布匹的內容有疑問，這同樣成立。對於一個完全無辜的比丘來說，這似乎是一個嚴厲的懲罰，但我們必須記住，即使在不知情的情況下收到了這筆錢，他現在也擁有了這筆錢，並且必須以適當的方式處置它。本戒條下的行儀給出了具體如何做到這一點的指示。

   * - If a bhikkhu accepts or consents to the placing of something that is not gold or money and yet he perceives it to be gold or money or is in doubt about its status, he incurs a dukkaṭa.

     - 如果比丘接受或同意放置非黃金或金錢的東西，但他認為它是黃金或金錢或對其狀態有疑問，他就會犯《突吉羅》。

   * - Gold Buddha images and gold items given to Buddha images, relics, or stūpas are not mentioned in the texts in connection with this rule. Over the centuries the common practice has been not to regard them as fulfilling the factor of object here, probably because Buddha images, stūpas, and relics, strictly speaking, cannot be owned by anyone. Similarly with items given to a Buddha image, etc.: Technically, these belong to the image, etc., and not to the monastery in which it may be located. Thus, as long as a bhikkhu realizes that he cannot assume ownership of any of these things, he may handle them without incurring an offense under this rule.

     - 文獻中沒有提到與此戒條相關的金佛像和供養佛像、舍利或塔的黃金物品。幾個世紀以來，普遍的做法是不認為它們滿足了這裡的對象因素，可能是因為嚴格來說，佛像、佛塔和舍利不能為任何人所擁有。與給予佛像等的物品類似：從技術上講，這些物品屬於佛像等，而不屬於它所在的寺院。因此，只要比丘意識到他不能擁有這些物品中的任何一件，他就可以處理它們，而不會觸犯本戒條。

   * - As mentioned under `NP 10`_, the Commentary derives from the Canon a list of items that it says carry a dukkaṭa when accepted by a bhikkhu. These include pearls and precious stones; uncooked grain and raw meat; women and girls, male and female slaves; goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares; fields and property. For convenience’s sake, we will refer to these items from here on as dukkaṭa objects *(dukkaṭa-vatthu)*, or D.O. for short.

     - 正如\ `《捨墮》十`_\中所提到的，《義註》源自《聖典》的一份物品列表，它說當比丘接受時會犯《突吉羅》。其中包括珍珠和寶石；未煮熟的穀物和生肉；女人和女孩、男性和女性奴隸；山羊和綿羊、家禽和豬、大象、牛、馬和母馬；土地和財產。為了方便起見，我們從這裡開始將這些物品稱為《突吉羅》物件\ *(dukkaṭa-vatthu)*\，或縮寫成 D.O. 。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - This factor may be fulfilled by any of three actions: accepting gold or money, having it accepted, or consenting to its being deposited. As noted above, the factors of the offense differ among the three: In the first two, the question of whether the bhikkhu consents to the gold or money does not enter into the definition of the act, nor does the donor’s intention as to who the gold or money is for. Only in the third act is the bhikkhu’s consent required to fulfill the action, and only there is it required that the donor intend the gold or money for the bhikkhu himself.

     - 這個因素可以透過以下三種行為中的任何一種來實現：接受黃金或金錢、讓其被接受，或同意將其存放。如上所述，這三種犯戒的因素有所不同：在前兩種情況下，比丘是否同意黃金或金錢的問題不屬於該行為的定義，布施者對於黃金或金錢是給誰的意圖也不屬於。只有在第三種行為中，才需要比丘同意才能完成該行動，並且只有在布施者打算將黃金或金錢送給比丘本人時才需要。

   * - *1) Accepting*
     - *1) 接受*

   * - According to the K/Commentary, this includes receiving gold or money offered as a gift or picking up gold or money left lying around ownerless. (As the non-offense clauses show, this factor does not cover cases where one picks up money left lying around the monastery or a house where one is visiting if one’s purpose is to keep it in safekeeping for the owner. See `Pc 84`_.) According to the Commentary, a bhikkhu who accepts money wrapped up in a bolt of cloth would also commit an offense here, which shows that this act includes receiving or taking the money not only with one’s body, but also with items connected with the body. Thus accepting money in an envelope or having it placed in one’s shoulder bag as it hangs from one’s shoulder would fulfill this factor as well.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，這包括接收作為布施提供的黃金或金錢，或拾取無主的黃金或金錢。（如不犯條款所示，此因素不包括以下情況：如果目的是為所有者妥善保管，撿起留在寺院或正在參觀的房屋周圍的錢的情況。參閱\ `《波逸提》八四`_\。）根據《義註》，比丘接受用布包裹的金錢也犯了本戒，這表明此行為不僅包括用自己的身體接受或拿走金錢，還包括用與身體相連的物品。因此，接受裝在信封裡的錢或把它放在掛在肩上的肩包裡也可以滿足此因素。
