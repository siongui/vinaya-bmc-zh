          *如果任何比丘接受金銀，或令接受金銀，或同意將其存放（在他附近），則該金銀將被捨出並懺悔。*

   * - As mentioned under `NP 10`_, one of the purposes of this rule is to relieve a bhikkhu of the burden of ownership that comes as the result of accepting gifts of money or having them accepted in one’s name. The discourses contain passages, though, indicating other purposes for this rule as well:

     - 正如\ `《捨墮》十`_\ 中所提到的，本戒條的目的之一是減輕比丘因接受金錢布施或令其以自己的名義接受而產生的所有權負擔。不過，經文中所包含的段落也顯示了本戒條的其他目的：

          “For anyone for whom gold and silver are allowable, the five strings of sensuality are also allowable. For anyone for whom the five strings of sensuality are allowable, gold and silver are allowable (reading *yassa pañca kāmaguṇā kappanti tassa-pi jātarūpa-rajataṁ kappati* with the Thai edition). That you can unequivocally recognize as not the quality of a contemplative, not the quality of one of the Sakyan sons.”—`SN 42:10`_

          “Bhikkhus, there are these four obscurations of the sun and moon, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? Clouds… Fog…. Smoke and dust… Rāhu, the king of the asuras (believed to be the cause of an eclipse) is an obscuration, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle…. In the same way, there are four obscurations of contemplatives and brahmans, obscured by which some contemplatives and brahmans don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? There are some contemplatives and brahmans who… do not refrain from drinking alcohol and fermented liquor… who do not refrain from sexual intercourse… who do not refrain from accepting gold and silver… who do not refrain from wrong livelihood…. Because of these obscurations, some brahmans and contemplatives… covered with darkness, slaves to craving, led on, swell the terrible charnel ground, grab at further becoming.”—`AN 4:50`_

          「諸比丘，日月有四種障蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？雲……霧……煙塵……羅睺，阿修羅之王（據信是日食的原因）是遮蔽物，被它遮蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝……。同樣地，沙門和婆羅門也有四種障蔽，有些沙門和婆羅門被這四種障蔽所遮蔽，不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？有沙門、婆羅門……不遠離飲酒及發酵飲料……不遠離淫欲法……不遠離接受金銀……不遠離邪命……。由於這些障蔽，有些婆羅門和沙門…被黑暗所籠罩，成為貪愛的奴隸，被牽引，擴大了可怖的墳場，執取後有。」—`《增支部》4:50經`_

   * - Bhikkhus, in abandoning the use of money, make real their abandonment of worldly pursuits and show others by example that the struggle for wealth is not the true way to find happiness.

     - 比丘們放棄使用金錢，就真正放棄了世俗的追求，並以身作則向他人表明，為財富而奮鬥並不是尋找幸福的真正方法。

   * - The factors for an offense under this rule are two: object and effort. However, because “object” is defined in one way for the first two actions stated in the rule, and in another way for the third, it seems best to analyze this rule as covering two separate but related offenses.

     - 根據本戒條，犯戒的因素有兩個：對象和努力。然而，由於「對象」以一種方式定義為戒條中規定的前兩種行為，而第三種行為則以另一種方式定義，因此似乎最好將本戒條分析為涵蓋兩種獨立但相關的犯戒。

   * - In the first offense the factors are:
     - 在第一種犯戒中，因素是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver.
     - *1）對象：*\金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One accepts or gets someone else to accept it.
     - *2）努力：*\接受或讓別人接受它。

   * - In the second offense they are:
     - 在第二種犯戒中，他們是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver intended for one.
     - *1）對象：*\供使用的金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One consents to its being placed down next to one.
     - *2）努力：*\同意將其放在旁邊。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *gold* so as to include anything made of gold. *Silver* it defines to cover coins made of silver, copper, wood, or lac, or whatever is used as a currency. The Commentary adds such examples as bones, pieces of hide, fruit, and seeds of trees used as currency, whether they have been stamped with a figure or not. At present, the term would include coins and paper currency, as well as money orders and cashiers checks not made out to a specific payee, as these meet all three requirements of a currency: (1) They are a generally accepted medium of exchange; (2) they are of standard recognized value; and (3) they are presentable by any bearer. The following items, because they do not fulfill all three of these requirements, would not count as “silver” under this rule: money orders and cashier’s checks made out to a specific payee; personal checks and travelers’ checks; credit cards and debit cards; gift cards, phone cards, frequent flyer miles; food stamps; and promissory notes.

     - 《經分別》對\ *金*\的定義\ `包括所有黃金製成的東西`_。它定義的「\ *銀*\」\ `包括由銀、銅、木頭、樹膠或任何用作貨幣的物質製成的硬幣`_。《義註》添加了用作貨幣的骨頭、獸皮碎片、水果和樹種等例子，無論它們是否帶有數字印記。目前，該術語包括硬幣和紙幣，以及未開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票，因為它們滿足貨幣的所有三個要求：（1）它們是普遍接受的交換媒介；（2）具有標準認可價值；（3）任何持有者均可出示。以下物品，因為不符合所有這三個要求，因此根據本戒條不能算作「銀」：開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票；個人支票和旅行支票；信用卡和金融卡；禮品卡、電話卡、飛行常客哩程；食品券；和\ `期票（本票）`_\。

   * - Because the word *silver* here functionally means “money,” that is how I will translate it for the remainder of the discussion of this rule.
     - 因為這裡的“銀”這個詞在功能上意味著“金錢”，所以我將在本戒條的其餘討論中對其進行翻譯。

   * - The Vibhaṅga indicates that perception is not a mitigating factor in either offense. Thus if a bhikkhu receives gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else—as when accepting a closed envelope not knowing that it contains money, or consenting to a bolt of cloth’s being placed near him, unaware that money has been placed inside it—he commits the full offense all the same. The same holds true if he is in doubt about what the envelope or bolt of cloth contains. This may seem a harsh penalty for a bhikkhu acting in complete innocence, but we must remember that, having received the money even unknowingly, he is now in possession of it and must dispose of it in a proper way. The protocols under this rule give directions for precisely how to do that.

     - 《經分別》指出，感知並不是這兩種犯戒的減輕因素。因此，如果比丘收到黃金或金錢，即使他將其視為其他東西，例如當他接受一個封閉的信封時，並不知道裡面裝有金錢，或者同意將一塊布匹放在他附近，但不知道裡面已經放入金錢了，他仍然完全違犯此戒。如果他對信封或布匹的內容有疑問，這同樣成立。對於一個完全無辜的比丘來說，這似乎是一個嚴厲的懲罰，但我們必須記住，即使在不知情的情況下收到了這筆錢，他現在也擁有了這筆錢，並且必須以適當的方式處置它。本戒條下的行儀給出了具體如何做到這一點的指示。

   * - If a bhikkhu accepts or consents to the placing of something that is not gold or money and yet he perceives it to be gold or money or is in doubt about its status, he incurs a dukkaṭa.

     - 如果比丘接受或同意放置非黃金或金錢的東西，但他認為它是黃金或金錢或對其狀態有疑問，他就會犯《突吉羅》。

   * - Gold Buddha images and gold items given to Buddha images, relics, or stūpas are not mentioned in the texts in connection with this rule. Over the centuries the common practice has been not to regard them as fulfilling the factor of object here, probably because Buddha images, stūpas, and relics, strictly speaking, cannot be owned by anyone. Similarly with items given to a Buddha image, etc.: Technically, these belong to the image, etc., and not to the monastery in which it may be located. Thus, as long as a bhikkhu realizes that he cannot assume ownership of any of these things, he may handle them without incurring an offense under this rule.

     - 文獻中沒有提到與此戒條相關的金佛像和供養佛像、舍利或塔的黃金物品。幾個世紀以來，普遍的做法是不認為它們滿足了這裡的對象因素，可能是因為嚴格來說，佛像、佛塔和舍利不能為任何人所擁有。與給予佛像等的物品類似：從技術上講，這些物品屬於佛像等，而不屬於它所在的寺院。因此，只要比丘意識到他不能擁有這些物品中的任何一件，他就可以處理它們，而不會觸犯本戒條。

   * - As mentioned under `NP 10`_, the Commentary derives from the Canon a list of items that it says carry a dukkaṭa when accepted by a bhikkhu. These include pearls and precious stones; uncooked grain and raw meat; women and girls, male and female slaves; goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares; fields and property. For convenience’s sake, we will refer to these items from here on as dukkaṭa objects *(dukkaṭa-vatthu)*, or D.O. for short.

     - 正如\ `《捨墮》十`_\中所提到的，《義註》源自《聖典》的一份物品列表，它說當比丘接受時會犯《突吉羅》。其中包括珍珠和寶石；未煮熟的穀物和生肉；女人和女孩、男性和女性奴隸；山羊和綿羊、家禽和豬、大象、牛、馬和母馬；土地和財產。為了方便起見，我們從這裡開始將這些物品稱為《突吉羅》物件\ *(dukkaṭa-vatthu)*\，或縮寫成 D.O. 。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - This factor may be fulfilled by any of three actions: accepting gold or money, having it accepted, or consenting to its being deposited. As noted above, the factors of the offense differ among the three: In the first two, the question of whether the bhikkhu consents to the gold or money does not enter into the definition of the act, nor does the donor’s intention as to who the gold or money is for. Only in the third act is the bhikkhu’s consent required to fulfill the action, and only there is it required that the donor intend the gold or money for the bhikkhu himself.

     - 這個因素可以透過以下三種行為中的任何一種來實現：接受黃金或金錢、讓其被接受，或同意將其存放。如上所述，這三種犯戒的因素有所不同：在前兩種情況下，比丘是否同意黃金或金錢的問題不屬於該行為的定義，布施者對於黃金或金錢是給誰的意圖也不屬於。只有在第三種行為中，才需要比丘同意才能完成該行動，並且只有在布施者打算將黃金或金錢送給比丘本人時才需要。

   * - *1) Accepting*
     - *1) 接受*

   * - According to the K/Commentary, this includes receiving gold or money offered as a gift or picking up gold or money left lying around ownerless. (As the non-offense clauses show, this factor does not cover cases where one picks up money left lying around the monastery or a house where one is visiting if one’s purpose is to keep it in safekeeping for the owner. See `Pc 84`_.) According to the Commentary, a bhikkhu who accepts money wrapped up in a bolt of cloth would also commit an offense here, which shows that this act includes receiving or taking the money not only with one’s body, but also with items connected with the body. Thus accepting money in an envelope or having it placed in one’s shoulder bag as it hangs from one’s shoulder would fulfill this factor as well.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，這包括接收作為布施提供的黃金或金錢，或拾取無主的黃金或金錢。（如不犯條款所示，此因素不包括以下情況：如果目的是為所有者妥善保管，撿起留在寺院或正在參觀的房屋周圍的錢的情況。參閱\ `《波逸提》八四`_\。）根據《義註》，比丘接受用布包裹的金錢也犯了本戒，這表明此行為不僅包括用自己的身體接受或拿走金錢，還包括用與身體相連的物品。因此，接受裝在信封裡的錢或把它放在掛在肩上的肩包裡也可以滿足此因素。

   * - The K/Commentary adds the stipulation that in the taking there must be some movement of the gold or money from one place to another. It offers no explanation for this point, but it may refer to cases where the gold or money is forced on a bhikkhu. (Because the presence or absence of the bhikkhu’s consent does not enter into the definition of the act of accepting, this means that when gold or money is forced on him, the act has been accomplished.) A typical example where this stipulation is useful is when a bhikkhu is on alms round and a lay donor, against the bhikkhu’s protestations, places money in his bowl. The stipulation allows the bhikkhu simply to stand there until he gets the donor or someone else to remove the money, and he would be absolved of an offense under this rule.

     - K/《義註》增加了這樣的規定：在取得過程中，黃金或金錢必須有從一處到另一處的某種移動。它沒有對這一點作出解釋，但它可能指的是黃金或金錢被強加給比丘的情況。（因為比丘的同意與否並不屬於接受行為的定義，這意味著當黃金或金錢被強加給他時，該行為就已經完成了。）這一規定有用的典型例子是當一位比丘托缽時，一位在家人不顧比丘的抗議，將錢放入他的缽中。該規定允許比丘簡單地站在那裡，直到他讓施主或其他人取走錢，根據本戒條，他將被免除犯戒。

   * - The commentaries add intention as an extra factor—the full offense is entailed only if the bhikkhu is taking the gold or money for his own sake—but there is no basis for this in the Vibhaṅga. The bhikkhu’s intention in accepting the money does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s discussions of any of the three actions covered by this rule, the donor’s intent does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s definition of this action, and the non-offense clauses do not allow for a bhikkhu to accept money for others, so the added factor seems unwarranted. Whether the bhikkhu accepts gold or money for himself or for others is thus not an issue here.

     - 註釋書中加入了意圖作為一個額外的因素——只有當比丘為了自己的利益而獲取黃金或金錢時，才構成完全的犯戒——但在《經分別》中沒有這方面的依據。比丘接受金錢的意圖不屬於《經分別》對本戒條所涵蓋的三種行為中任何一種的討論，布施者的意圖不屬於《經分別》對此行為的定義，並且不犯條款不允許比丘為他人接受金錢，所以增加的因素似乎沒有根據。因此，比丘是否為自己或他人接受黃金或金錢在這裡並不是問題。

   * - *2) Having gold or money accepted*
     - *2) 讓黃金或金錢被接受*

   * - Having gold or money accepted, according to the K/Commentary, includes getting someone else to do any of the actions covered under accepting, as described above. Examples from the commentaries, which draw on the protocols under `NP 10`_, include such things as telling the donor to give the money to a steward, telling the donor that so-and-so will take the money for him; telling the steward to take the money, to put it in a donation box, to “do what he thinks appropriate,” or any similar command.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，接受黃金或金錢包括讓其他人執行接受所涵蓋的任何行動，如上所述。註釋書中的例子借鑒了\ `《捨墮》十`_\下的行儀，包括告訴布施者將錢交給\ `淨人`_\、告訴布施者某某會替他拿走這筆錢；告訴淨人拿走錢，將其放入捐款箱（功德箱），「做他認為合適的事情」，或任何類似的命令。

   * - Anything that falls short of a command, though, would not fulfill this factor, as we have already seen under `NP 10`_. Thus simply telling the donor that X is the bhikkhus’ steward—or that the monastery’s stewards have placed a donation box in such-and-such a place—would not be a factor for an offense here. Also, if the donor—over the bhikkhu’s protestations—leaves money, say, on a table as a gift for a bhikkhu, then if the bhikkhu tells his steward what the donor did and said, without telling the steward to do anything with the money—letting the steward figure things out on his/her own—this too would not entail a penalty. The Commentary’s discussion of stewards under the next point shows that while a bhikkhu who tells a volunteer steward to put such a donation in a donation box would incur a penalty, a bhikkhu who simply points out the donation box would not.

     - 然而，任何不符合命令的事情都不會滿足這個因素，正如我們在\ `《捨墮》十`_\中已經看到的那樣。因此，僅僅告訴施主 X 是比丘的淨人──或是寺院的淨人在某處放置了一個捐款箱（功德箱）──在這裡並不會構成犯戒的因素。另外，如果施主不顧比丘的抗議，比如說，將錢留在桌上作為給比丘的布施，那麼如果比丘告訴他的淨人，施主做了什麼和說過什麼，但沒有告訴淨人如何處理這筆錢——讓淨人自己解決問題——這也不會帶來懲罰。《義註》在下一點中對淨人的討論表明，雖然比丘告訴志願者淨人將此類捐款放入捐款箱（功德箱）會受到處罰，但比丘只是指出捐款箱（功德箱）則不會受到處罰。

   * - As with the act of accepting, the questions of the bhikkhu’s consent, his intent in accepting, and the donor’s intent in giving do not enter into the definition of this action.

     - 與接受行為一樣，比丘的同意、接受的意圖以及布施者布施的意圖等問題不屬於該行為的定義。

   * - *3) Consenting to gold or money’s being deposited*
     - *3) 同意存放黃金或金錢*

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines this action as follows: “He (the donor), saying, ‘This is for the master,’ deposits it, and the bhikkhu consents (§).” According to the K/Commentary, depositing covers two sorts of situations:

     - `《經分別》對此行為的定義如下`_\：「他（布施者）說：『這是給大師的』，將其存入，比丘同意（§）。」根據 K/《義註》，存放分為兩種情況：

   * - 1\) The donor places gold or money anywhere in the bhikkhu’s presence, and says, “This is for the master,” or

     - 1\) 布施者將黃金或金錢放在比丘面前的任何地方，並說：「這是給大師的」，或

   * - 2\) The donor tells him, “I have some gold or money deposited in such-and-such a location. It’s yours.” (One of the implications of this second case is that any monastery with a donation box should make clear that money left in the box is being placed with the steward. Because `NP 10`_ allows a donor to place gold or money intended for a bhikkhu’s needs with a steward, the act of placing money with such a person in a bhikkhu’s presence does not count as “depositing” here.)

     - 2\) 布施者告訴他：「我在某處存放了一些黃金或金錢。是你的。」（此第二個案例的含義之一是，任何設有捐款箱（功德箱）的寺院都應明確表示，箱中的錢存放在淨人那裡。因為\ `《捨墮》十`_\允許布施者將用於比丘需要的黃金或金錢存放在淨人處，當比丘在場的情況下向這樣的人放置金錢的行為在此不算作「存放」。

   * - *Consenting* in either of these cases, says the Commentary, means that one does not refuse either in thought, word, or deed. Refusing in thought means thinking, “This is not proper for me.” Refusing in word means telling the donor that such a gift is not allowable. Refusing in deed means making a gesture to the same effect. If one refuses in any of these ways—e.g., one wants to accept the gold or money, but tells the donor that it is not allowable; or one says nothing, but simply reminds oneself that such gifts are not proper to accept—one avoids the penalty here.

     - 《義註》說，在這兩種情況下，\ *同意*\意味著一個人在思想、言語或行為（身口意）上都沒有拒絕。思想（意）上的拒絕意味著想：「這不適合我。」口頭（口）拒絕是指告訴布施者這樣的布施是不被允許的。行為（身）拒絕意味著做出同樣效果的示意動作。如果以任何一種方式拒絕——例如，想接受黃金或金錢，但告訴布施者這是不允許的；或是甚麼也沒說，只是提醒自己這樣的布施不適合接受──這樣就可以避免受到懲罰。

   * - The question of whether it is best to express one’s refusal outwardly lies beyond the scope of the Vinaya and often depends on the situation. Ideally, one should inform the donor so that he/she will know enough not to present such gifts in the future, but there are cases where the donor is still new to the idea of rules and will simply be offended if the bhikkhu objects to what he/she means as a well-intentioned gesture. This is thus a matter where a bhikkhu should use his discretion.

     - 是否最好從外表上表達拒絕的問題超出了戒律的範圍，而且往往取決於具體情況。理想情況下，應該告知布施者，以便他/她知道將來不要做此類布施，但在某些情況下，布施者對戒條的概念仍然很陌生，如果比丘反對他/她所表達的善意行動，布施者只會感到被冒犯。因此，這是比丘應該運用自己的判斷力的問題。

   * - The Commentary contains a long discussion of what a bhikkhu should do if, after he refuses such a donation, the donor goes off leaving it there anyway. If someone else comes along and asks the bhikkhu, “What is this?”, the bhikkhu may tell him/her what he and the donor said, but may not ask him/her to do anything about it. If the person volunteers to put the gold or money into safekeeping, the bhikkhu may point out a safe place but may not tell him/her to put it there.

     - 《義註》中有一個長篇大論的討論，如果比丘在拒絕這樣的布施後，布施者卻把它留在那裡，他應該怎麼做。如果其他人走過來問比丘：「這是什麼？」，比丘可以告訴他/她他和施主所說的話，但不能要求他/她對此做任何事情。如果此人自願將黃金或金錢保管起來，比丘可以指出一個安全的地方，但不能告訴他/她把它放在那裡。

   * - Once the gold or money is in a safe place, one may point it out to other people—one’s steward, for instance—but may not tell anyone to take it. The Commentary gives directions for how to arrange an exchange with gold or money in such a case so as not to violate `NP 19`_ & 20_, but I will save that part of the discussion until we come to those rules.

     - 一旦黃金或金錢到達安全的地方，可以將其指出給其他人（例如淨人），但不得告訴任何人拿走它。《義註》給出了在這種情況下如何安排黃金或金錢兌換的指示，以免違反\ `《捨墮》一九`_\和\ `二十`_\，但我將保留這部分討論，直到我們遇到這些戒條。

   * - However, the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “depositing” gold or money for a bhikkhu indicates that the question of who the donor intends the money for *does* make a difference under this action, because the nature of the donor’s action is defined by what he or she says. If the donor means the money for the bhikkhu and the bhikkhu consents to its being placed nearby, that fulfills the factor here. This covers cases where the donor says, “This is for you,” or “This is for you to give to X.”

     - 然而，《經分別》對為比丘「存放」黃金或金錢的定義表明，布施者打算將錢送給誰的問題在這一行為中\ *確實*\產生了影響，因為布施者行為的性質是由他或她所說的來定義的。如果布施者的意思是給比丘錢，而比丘同意將錢放在附近，那就滿足了這裡的因素。這包括布施者說「這是給你的」或「這是讓你給 X 的」的情況。

   * - In cases where the donor says, “This is for the Community,” or “This is for Bhikkhu Y,” and Bhikkhu X consents to its being placed down near him, the Commentary—drawing on the Great Standards—says that X incurs a dukkaṭa. It does not say, though, what should be done with the money, aside from stating that any bhikkhu who uses anything bought with it also incurs a dukkaṭa. Its discussion of the following rule, though, would seem to imply that it should be returned to the original donor.

     - 如果布施者說：「這是給僧團」或「這是給比丘 Y」，並且比丘 X 同意將其放置在他附近，則《義註》根據《四大教示》說 X 會犯《突吉羅》。然而，它並沒有說應該用這些錢做什麼，只是說任何比丘使用用它購買的任何東西也會犯《突吉羅》。然而，它對以下戒條的討論似乎意味著它應該退還給最初的布施者。

   * - If money for Bhikkhu Y is placed near Bhikkhu X in this way, and Y in turn consents to the donation, then Y would incur the full penalty here as well. The Commentary’s discussion under `NP 10`_ indicates that if money for the Community is placed near Bhikkhu X, the Community is said to have consented to it only when all members of the Community unanimously consent to it. If one member refuses consent, he saves all the other members from committing an offense—except for X, who still has his dukkaṭa.

     - 如果比丘 Y 的錢以這種方式放在比丘 X 附近，而 Y 又同意該布施，那麼 Y 也會在這裡遭受全額懲罰。\ `《捨墮》十`_\下的《義註》討論表明，如果僧團的資金放在 X 比丘附近，只有當僧團的所有成員一致同意時，才被認為是僧團同意的。如果一位成員拒絕同意，他會阻止所有其他成員犯戒——除了 X，他仍然犯《突吉羅》。

   * - The Commentary here also says that a bhikkhu who consents to monetary donations “placed nearby” him for monastery buildings incurs a dukkaṭa as well. This refers to cases where the donor says, “This is for the Community to use in building such-and-such,” and places the money down next to the bhikkhu. As the Commentary itself says under `NP 10`_, if the donor does not mention the name of the bhikkhu or the Community as custodians or recipients of the funds, the donations are not to be refused. Rather, they are to be left there and the steward told of what the donor said.

     - 這裡的《義註》還說，一位比丘同意將金錢捐贈放在他「附近」來建造寺院建築，也會犯《突吉羅》。這是指布施者說：「這是供僧團用於建造某物的」，並將錢放在比丘旁邊。正如《義註》本身在\ `《捨墮》十`_\下所說，如果布施者沒有提及作為資金保管人或接受者的比丘或僧團的名稱，則布施不得被拒絕。相反，他們應該被留在那兒，告訴淨人布施者所說的話。

   * - **Forfeiture & confession**
     - **捨出 & 懺罪**

   * - A bhikkhu who commits either offense under this rule must forfeit the gold or money in the midst of a formal meeting of the Community before confessing the offense. The formulae and procedures for forfeiture and confession are given in `Appendix VI`_. This is one of the few NP rules where the offender may not forfeit the item in question to an individual bhikkhu or to a group of less than four. Once he has forfeited the gold or money and confessed his offense, the Community may not return it to him, as there is no way a bhikkhu is allowed to possess these things.

     - 犯下本戒條的比丘必須在懺罪之前在僧團的正式會議中捨出黃金或金錢。捨出和懺罪的公式和程序請見\ `附錄六`_\。這是為數不多的《捨墮》戒條之一，犯戒者不得將相關物品捨出給單一比丘或少於四人的團體。一旦他捨出了黃金或金錢並懺悔了自己的罪行，僧團不得將其歸還給他，因為比丘不能擁有這些東西。

   * - If a lay person comes along after the gold or money has been forfeited, the bhikkhus may tell him, “Look at this.” If he asks, “What should be bought with this?”, the bhikkhus are not to tell him to buy anything (as that would violate `NP 20`_), although they may tell him what in general is allowable for bhikkhus, such as the five tonics, as under `NP 23`_, below. If he takes the gold or money and purchases any proper items, all the bhikkhus except the one who originally accepted the gold or money may make use of them. If the lay person does not volunteer to buy anything with the gold or money, the bhikkhus should tell him to get rid of it.

     - 如果在黃金或金錢被捨出後，有居士出現，比丘們可以告訴他：「看看這個。」如果他問：「應該用這個買什麼？」，比丘們不要告訴他買任何東西（因為這會違反\ `《捨墮》二十`_\），儘管他們可以告訴他一般來說對比丘們而言什麼是允許的，例如五種補品（譯註：七日藥），如\ `《捨墮》二三`_\所示。如果他拿走黃金或金錢並且購買任何適當的物品，除最初接受黃金或金錢的比丘外，所有比丘都可以使用它們。如果居士不自願用黃金或金錢購買任何東西，比丘們應該告訴他要把它摒棄掉。

   * - If he does not get rid of it, they are to choose one of the bhikkhus present as the “money-disposer,” by means of the transaction statement—a motion and one proclamation *(ñatti-dutiya-kamma)*\—given in `Appendix VI`_. The money-disposer must be free of the four forms of bias—based on desire, aversion, delusion, or fear—and must know when money is properly disposed of and when it is not. His duty is to throw the money away without taking note of where it falls. If he does take note, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The Commentary recommends that, “Closing his eyes, he should throw it into a river, over a cliff, or into a jungle thicket without paying attention to where it falls, disinterested as if it were a bodily secretion *(gūthaka)*.”

     - 如果他不摒棄它，他們將通過在\ `附錄六`_\中的羯磨聲明——一項動議和一份公告[譯註：一白與一羯磨]\ *（ñatti-dutiya-kamma [譯註：白二羯磨]）*\——選擇在場的比丘之一作為「金錢處置者」。金錢處置者必須免於四種形式的偏見——基於欲望、嗔恨、愚癡、或恐懼——並且必須知道何時金錢被正確地處置，何時不正確。他的職責就是把錢丟掉，而不注意它落到哪裡。如果他確實注意到了，他犯《突吉羅》。《義註》建議：「閉上眼睛，將其扔進河裡、懸崖上或叢林中，而不注意它落到哪裡，漠不關心，就好像它是身體的分泌物\ *（gūthaka）*\一樣。」

   * - None of the texts mention what a bhikkhu is to do with dukkaṭa objects he has received, but as we shall see under the following rule, the Commentary would seem to suggest that he return them to their donors.

     - 沒有任何文字提到比丘如何處理他收到的《突吉羅》物件，但正如我們將在以下戒條中看到的，《義註》似乎建議他將這些物品歸還給施主。

   * - As mentioned above, there is no offense for the bhikkhu who, finding gold or money lying around the monastery or in a house he is visiting, puts it away in safe keeping for the owner. This point is discussed in detail under `Pc 84`_.

     - 如上所述，比丘在寺院周圍或他所拜訪的房屋中發現黃金或金錢，為其所有者將其妥善保管，這並沒有犯戒。這一點在\ `《波逸提》八四`_\中有詳細討論。

   * - **Checks**
     - **支票**

   * - There is some controversy over the status of checks under this rule. In legal terms, a check is a notice to a bank to provide funds for the payee. Because banks are corporate individuals and not “places,” a check made out to a bhikkhu is thus equivalent to a notice from a donor to a steward to provide funds on the bhikkhu’s behalf. Because the funds in question do not change ownership until the recipient cashes the check, this strengthens the similarity to funds placed with a steward: The funds still belong to the donor until they are used, and the steward is responsible if they become lost in the meantime. Thus the simple act of receiving a check counts not as an act of receiving money but as an acknowledgement of the notice. In passing the notice to someone else, one is simply informing them of the donor’s arrangement. Only if a bhikkhu cashes a check or gives an order to someone else to do so does he commit an offense under this rule.

     - 對於本戒條下的支票的地位存在一些爭議。從法律角度來說，支票是銀行向收款人提供資金的通知。因為銀行是法人個體而非「場所」，所以開給比丘的支票相當於布施者向淨人發出的代替比丘提供資金的通知。由於相關資金在收款人兌現支票之前不會改變所有權，因此這增強了存放與淨人的資金的相似性：資金在使用之前仍屬於布施者，如果資金在使用過程中丟失，則淨人負責。因此，僅接收支票的行為不算是接收金錢的行為，而是對通知的確認。將通知傳遞給其他人時，只是告知他們布施者的安排。只有當比丘兌現支票或命令其他人這樣做時，他才犯下本戒條。

   * - A bhikkhu who uses a check as a means of barter commits an offense under `NP 20`_. The most he is allowed to do when receiving a check is to hand it over to his steward—being careful not to say anything that would violate the etiquette of *kappiya vohāra* (“wording things right”) under this rule or `NP 10`_, 19_, & 20_\—and to let the steward make whatever arrangements he/she sees fit.

     - 使用支票作為以物易物的比丘犯了\ `《捨墮》二十`_\罪。當他收到支票時，他最多可以做的就是將其交給他的淨人，注意不要說出任何違反本戒條或\ `《捨墮》十`_、\ `一九`_\、\ `二十`_\規定的 *kappiya vohāra* （「措辭正確」）禮儀的內容——並讓淨人做出他/她認為合適的任何安排。

   * - *The Vibhaṅga’s interpretation*
     - *《經分別》的解釋*

   * - Monetary exchange refers primarily to the type of business and speculation a gold dealer would engage in—exchanging currency, trading gold ore for gold shaped into ornaments or vice versa, trading gold ore for gold ore, or gold ornaments for gold ornaments—but the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of perception shows that the factor of effort here includes any exchange in which the bhikkhu ends up with gold or money as a result of the exchange. Thus it would cover cases where a bhikkhu sells any kind of item—allowable or unallowable—for money.

     - 金錢兌換主要是指黃金交易商從事的業務和投機買賣類型——兌換貨幣、用金礦石換黃金飾品，反之亦然、用金礦石換金礦石、或者用金飾品換金飾品——但《經分別》對感知因素的討論表明，這裡的努力因素包括比丘最終得到黃金或金錢作為交換結果的任何交換。因此，它涵蓋了比丘為了金錢而出售任何種類的物品——無論是允許的還是不允許的——的情況。

   * - At first glance, this rule would seem redundant with the preceding rule against receiving money and the following rule against engaging in trade, but actually it closes a number of loopholes in those rules. In the preceding rule, a bhikkhu may point out a steward to a person who brings money intended for him; and in the following rule he can, if he words it right, propose a trade or tell a steward to arrange a trade for him. Thus, given just those two rules, it would be possible for a bhikkhu using “proper” procedures to have his steward engage in currency speculation and other money-making activities without committing an offense.

     - 乍看之下，與前面的禁止接受金錢的戒條和後面的禁止從事貿易的戒條，本戒條似乎是多餘的，但實際上它彌補了這些戒條中的一些漏洞。在前條戒條中，比丘可以向為他帶來金錢的人指出一名淨人；在後面的戒條中，如果他表達正確，他可以提出交易或告訴淨人為他安排交易。因此，只有這兩條戒條，比丘就有可能使用「適當」的程序讓他的淨人從事貨幣投機買賣和其他賺錢活動而不犯戒。

   * - This rule, though, includes no such exceptions for “wording things right *(kappiya-vohāra)*,” and so closes those loopholes as far as this type of trading is concerned. As a result, a bhikkhu may not express a desire to his steward that he/she sell something belonging to him or take funds dedicated for his use and invest them for monetary return. If the bhikkhu is going abroad, he must leave it up to his steward to figure out that any funds donated for his use may have to be exchanged for foreign currency if they are going to serve any purpose.

     - 不過，本戒條不包括「措辭正確\ *（kappiya-vohāra）*\」的例外情況，因此就此類交易而言，堵住了這些漏洞。結果，比丘不能向他的淨人表達，讓他/她出售屬於他的東西，或拿專用於他的資金並投資以獲取金錢回報的願望。如果比丘要出國，他必須讓他的淨人自己弄清楚，供他使用的任何布施資金如果要發揮任何作用，可能必須兌換成外幣。

   * - According to the K/Commentary, the item offered in exchange must be one’s own if the exchange is to fall under this rule, but the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clauses make no exemptions for a bhikkhu who engages in monetary exchange using items belonging to anyone else. Thus if a bhikkhu were to arrange a monetary exchange using goods belonging to his family, he would have to forfeit any proceeds from the exchange that they might offer to him.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，如果交換符合本戒條，則提供的交換物品必須是自己的，但《經分別》的不犯條款對於使用屬於其他人的物品進行金錢兌換的比丘沒有豁免。因此，如果比丘要使用屬於他家人的物品進行金錢兌換，他將不得不放棄他們可能提供給他的任何兌換收益。

   * - Perception is not a factor here. Thus, when receiving gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else or is in doubt about the matter, he would still be fulfilling the factor of effort. When receiving something other than gold or money, if he perceives it as gold or money or is in doubt about it, the penalty would be a dukkaṭa.

     - 感知不是這裡的因素。因此，當他收到黃金或金錢時，即使他認為這是其他東西或對此有疑問，他仍然滿足了努力的因素。當收到黃金或金錢以外的東西時，如果他認為它是黃金或金錢或對此有疑問，則會受到《突吉羅》的懲罰。

   * - *The Commentary’s interpretation*
     - *《義註》的解釋*

   * - According to the Commentary, monetary exchange refers to any trade in which money is involved—whether as the item the bhikkhu brings into the trade, gets out of the trade, or both. Buddhaghosa states that this interpretation is based on a passage that is not in the Vibhaṅga but logically should be. The Sub-commentary supports him, explaining that if monetary exchange covers trades in which money forms one side of the trade, it shouldn’t matter which side of the trade it is on.

     - 根據《義註》，金錢交換是指任何涉及金錢的交易——無論是比丘將物品帶入交易、帶出交易，或兩者兼而有之。\ *佛音*\指出，這種解釋所依據的一段話不在《經分別》中，但邏輯上應該是。《複註》支持他，解釋說如果金錢交換涵蓋金錢構成交易一方的交易，那麼金錢屬於交易的哪一方並不重要。

   * - This, however, contradicts a number of points in the Vibhaṅga. (1) Its table of the possible actions covered by this rule includes only cases where the outcome of the trade for the bhikkhu is money. As we noted in the Introduction, we have to trust that the Vibhaṅga arrangers knew what was and was not an offense under a certain rule, and that if they had meant the rule to cover more than the alternatives listed in the table they would have included them. (2) In the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of how the forfeiture is to be conducted, it consistently refers to the offender as the “one who purchased money” and to the bhikkhu who throws the forfeited object away as the “money-disposer.” (3) If *monetary exchange* covers cases where the bhikkhu uses money to buy allowable things, then the discussion of how a bhikkhu could get his steward to use money rightfully placed with the steward to buy such things would have been included under this rule; instead, it is included under the following rule. All of this seems to indicate that the Commentary is on shaky ground when it tries to force its interpretation on the Vibhaṅga here.

     - 然而，這與《經分別》中的許多觀點相矛盾。（1）本戒條涵蓋的可能行動表格僅包括比丘交易的結果是金錢的情況。正如我們在\ **引言**\ 中指出的，我們必須相信《經分別》編排者知道在特定戒條下什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒，並且如果他們想讓該戒條涵蓋比表格中列出的替代方案更多的內容，他們就會包括他們。（2）《經分別》在討論如何進行捨出時，始終將犯戒者稱為「購買金錢的人」，並將扔掉捨出物品的比丘稱為「金錢處置者」。（3）如果\ *金錢兌換*\ 涵蓋比丘用金錢購買允許的物品的情況，那麼比丘如何讓他的淨人使用正確存放在淨人那裡的金錢來購買這些物品的討論就包含在本戒條中；相反，它包含在下一個戒條中。所有這些似乎都表明，當《義註》試圖將其解釋強加於此處的《經分別》時，它的基礎是不穩固的。

   * - Still, the Commentary’s interpretation is widely followed and fairly complex, so it will be good to discuss it in some detail.
     - 儘管如此，《義註》的解釋仍被廣泛遵循並且相當複雜，因此最好對其進行一些詳細討論。

   * - As under the preceding rule, the Commentary divides articles into three sorts:
     - 如同上一個戒條，《義註》將物件分為三類：

   * - *nissaggiya objects (N.O.)*, i.e., articles such as gold and money, which entail a nissaggiya pācittiya when accepted;
     - *《尼薩耆》物件（N.O.）*\，即黃金和金錢等物品，在接受時犯《捨墮》；

   * - *dukkaṭa objects (D.O.)*, articles such as pearls, precious stones; uncooked grain, raw meat; women and girls, male and female slaves; goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares; fields and property, any of which entail a dukkaṭa when accepted;
     - *《突吉羅》物件（D.O.）*\，珍珠、寶石等物品；未煮熟的穀物、生肉；女人和女孩、男性和女性奴隸；山羊和綿羊、家禽和豬、大象、牛、馬和母馬；土地和財產，其中任何一項在被接受時都會帶來《突吉羅》；

   * - *allowable objects (A.O.)*, articles that a bhikkhu may rightfully accept and possess.
     - *允許物件（A.O.）*\，比丘可以正當地接受和擁有的物品。

   * - It then works out the following scheme to cover all possible trades involving these objects:
     - 然後，它制定出以下方案來涵蓋所有涉及這些物件的可能的交易：
