          *Should any bhikkhu accept gold and silver, or have it accepted, or consent to its being deposited (near him), it is to be forfeited and confessed.*

          *如果任何比丘接受金銀，或令接受金銀，或同意將其存放（在他附近），則該金銀將被捨出並懺悔。*

   * - As mentioned under `NP 10`_, one of the purposes of this rule is to relieve a bhikkhu of the burden of ownership that comes as the result of accepting gifts of money or having them accepted in one’s name. The discourses contain passages, though, indicating other purposes for this rule as well:

     - 正如\ `《捨墮》十`_\ 中所提到的，本戒條的目的之一是減輕比丘因接受金錢布施或令其以自己的名義接受而產生的所有權負擔。不過，經文中所包含的段落也顯示了本戒條的其他目的：

          “For anyone for whom gold and silver are allowable, the five strings of sensuality are also allowable. For anyone for whom the five strings of sensuality are allowable, gold and silver are allowable (reading *yassa pañca kāmaguṇā kappanti tassa-pi jātarūpa-rajataṁ kappati* with the Thai edition). That you can unequivocally recognize as not the quality of a contemplative, not the quality of one of the Sakyan sons.”—`SN 42:10`_

          「凡金銀許可之人，五欲亦許可。凡五欲許可之人，金銀亦許可（泰文版讀作 *yassa pañca kāmaguṇā kappanti tassa-pi jātarūpa-rajataṁ kappati*\）。你可以明確地識別這不是沙門法，也不是釋迦子法之一。」—`《相應部》42:10經`_

          “Bhikkhus, there are these four obscurations of the sun and moon, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? Clouds… Fog…. Smoke and dust… Rāhu, the king of the asuras (believed to be the cause of an eclipse) is an obscuration, obscured by which the sun and moon don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle…. In the same way, there are four obscurations of contemplatives and brahmans, obscured by which some contemplatives and brahmans don’t glow, don’t shine, don’t dazzle. Which four? There are some contemplatives and brahmans who… do not refrain from drinking alcohol and fermented liquor… who do not refrain from sexual intercourse… who do not refrain from accepting gold and silver… who do not refrain from wrong livelihood…. Because of these obscurations, some brahmans and contemplatives… covered with darkness, slaves to craving, led on, swell the terrible charnel ground, grab at further becoming.”—`AN 4:50`_

          「諸比丘，日月有四種障蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？雲……霧……煙塵……羅睺，阿修羅之王（據信是日食的原因）是遮蔽物，被它遮蔽，日月不明亮、不光芒、不光輝……。同樣地，沙門和婆羅門也有四種障蔽，有些沙門和婆羅門被這四種障蔽所遮蔽，不明亮、不光芒、不光輝。哪四種？有沙門、婆羅門……不遠離飲酒及發酵飲料……不遠離淫欲法……不遠離接受金銀……不遠離邪命……。由於這些障蔽，有些婆羅門和沙門…被黑暗所籠罩，成為貪愛的奴隸，被牽引，擴大了可怖的墳場，執取後有。」—`《增支部》4:50經`_

   * - Bhikkhus, in abandoning the use of money, make real their abandonment of worldly pursuits and show others by example that the struggle for wealth is not the true way to find happiness.

     - 比丘們放棄使用金錢，就真正放棄了世俗的追求，並以身作則向他人表明，為財富而奮鬥並不是尋找幸福的真正方法。

   * - The factors for an offense under this rule are two: object and effort. However, because “object” is defined in one way for the first two actions stated in the rule, and in another way for the third, it seems best to analyze this rule as covering two separate but related offenses.

     - 根據本戒條，犯戒的因素有兩個：對象和努力。然而，由於「對象」以一種方式定義為戒條中規定的前兩種行為，而第三種行為則以另一種方式定義，因此似乎最好將本戒條分析為涵蓋兩種獨立但相關的犯戒。

   * - In the first offense the factors are:
     - 在第一種犯戒中，因素是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver.
     - *1）對象：*\金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One accepts or gets someone else to accept it.
     - *2）努力：*\接受或讓別人接受它。

   * - In the second offense they are:
     - 在第二種犯戒中，他們是：

   * - *1) Object:* gold or silver intended for one.
     - *1）對象：*\供使用的金或銀。

   * - *2) Effort:* One consents to its being placed down next to one.
     - *2）努力：*\同意將其放在旁邊。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *gold* so as to include anything made of gold. *Silver* it defines to cover coins made of silver, copper, wood, or lac, or whatever is used as a currency. The Commentary adds such examples as bones, pieces of hide, fruit, and seeds of trees used as currency, whether they have been stamped with a figure or not. At present, the term would include coins and paper currency, as well as money orders and cashiers checks not made out to a specific payee, as these meet all three requirements of a currency: (1) They are a generally accepted medium of exchange; (2) they are of standard recognized value; and (3) they are presentable by any bearer. The following items, because they do not fulfill all three of these requirements, would not count as “silver” under this rule: money orders and cashier’s checks made out to a specific payee; personal checks and travelers’ checks; credit cards and debit cards; gift cards, phone cards, frequent flyer miles; food stamps; and promissory notes.

     - 《經分別》對\ *金*\的定義\ `包括所有黃金製成的東西`_。它定義的「\ *銀*\」\ `包括由銀、銅、木頭、樹膠或任何用作貨幣的物質製成的硬幣`_。《義註》添加了用作貨幣的骨頭、獸皮碎片、水果和樹種等例子，無論它們是否帶有數字印記。目前，該術語包括硬幣和紙幣，以及未開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票，因為它們滿足貨幣的所有三個要求：（1）它們是普遍接受的交換媒介；（2）具有標準認可價值；（3）任何持有者均可出示。以下物品，因為不符合所有這三個要求，因此根據本戒條不能算作「銀」：開給特定收款人的匯票和銀行本票；個人支票和旅行支票；信用卡和金融卡；禮品卡、電話卡、飛行常客哩程；食品券；和\ `期票（本票）`_\。

   * - Because the word *silver* here functionally means “money,” that is how I will translate it for the remainder of the discussion of this rule.
     - 因為這裡的“銀”這個詞在功能上意味著“金錢”，所以我將在本戒條的其餘討論中對其進行翻譯。
