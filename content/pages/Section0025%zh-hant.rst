   * - **CHAPTER NINE**

   * - *Pāṭidesanīya*
     - *應悔過*

   * - This term means “to be acknowledged.” As a name for training rules, it means “entailing acknowledgement.” The four training rules here are unique in that they mention, as part of the rule, the words to be used in acknowledging the violation; the second rule is especially unique in that it depicts the violators as acknowledging their offense as a group.

     - 這個術語的意思是「應被悔過」。作為學處的名稱，它的意思是「必須悔過」。這裡的四個學處的獨特之處在於，它們在戒條中明確列出了悔過違犯時應使用的措辭；第二條戒條尤其獨特，因為它將違犯者描述為以群體形式悔過其犯戒。

          *Should any bhikkhu chew or consume staple or non-staple food, having received it with his own hand from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunī in an inhabited area, he is to acknowledge it: “Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that ought to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”*

   * - A long series of events led up to the formulation of this rule.
     - 一系列漫長事件導致了這條戒條的制定。

          “At that time a certain woman whose husband was away from home was made pregnant by her lover. She, having caused an abortion, said to a bhikkhunī who was dependent on her family for alms, ‘Come, lady, take this fetus away in your bowl.’ So the bhikkhunī, having placed the fetus in her bowl and covering it up with her outer robe, went away. Now at that time a certain alms-going bhikkhu had made this vow: ‘I won’t eat from the first almsfood I receive without having given some of it to a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī.’ Seeing the bhikkhunī, he said to her, ‘Come, sister, accept alms.’

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - There are two elements to this factor: the food sub-factor and the bhikkhunī sub-factor. Under the food sub-factor: *Staple food* follows the standard definition given in the `Food Chapter`_ under the pācittiya rules. *Non-staple food* includes all edibles except juice drinks, tonics, and medicines. Staple and non-staple food are grounds for a pāṭidesanīya; juice drinks, tonics, and medicines taken as food, grounds for a dukkaṭa.

     - 此因素有兩個元素：食物子因素和比丘尼子因素。食物子因素下：\ *主食*\ 遵循\ `食物品`_\ 中《波逸提》戒條下的標準定義。\ *副食*\ 包括除果汁飲料、補品和藥物以外的所有可食用物。主食和副食構成《應悔過》；將果汁飲料、補品和藥物作為食物服用，構成《突吉羅》。

   * - As for the bhikkhunī sub-factor: *Bhikkhunī* refers to one who has received the double ordination. A bhikkhunī who has received only her first ordination—in the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha—is grounds for a dukkaṭa. *Unrelated* means sharing no common ancestor back through seven generations. Perception as to whether the bhikkhunī is related is not a mitigating factor here. The permutations around the issue of perception here are similar to those under `Pc 4`_, with the only difference that the three pācittiyas under that pattern are changed to three pāṭidesanīyas here. In other words, if she is unrelated, she is grounds for a pāṭidesanīya whether one perceives her as unrelated, related, or doubtful. If she is related, she is grounds for a dukkaṭa if one perceives her as unrelated or doubtful. If she is related and one perceives her as related, she is not grounds for an offense. This pattern with regard to perception is followed in all four pāṭidesanīya rules.

     - 至於比丘尼子因素：\ *比丘尼*\ 指的是已受兩部受戒者。僅單部受戒（在比丘尼僧團）的比丘尼，構成《突吉羅》。\ *沒有血緣關係*\ 是指七代以內沒有共同祖先。在此，對比丘尼是否具有血緣關係的感知並非減輕懲罰的因素。這裡關於感知問題的排列組合與\ `《波逸提》四`_\ 中的排列組合類似，唯一的區別在於，該模式中的三個《波逸提》在此處變為三個《應悔過》。換言之，如果她無血緣關係，無論感知她為無血緣關係、有血緣關係還是存疑，都構成《應悔過》。如果她有血緣關係，無論感知她為無血緣關係或存疑，都構成《突吉羅》。如果她有血緣關係，感知她為有血緣關係，則不構成犯戒。所有四條《應悔過》戒條都遵循這種關於感知的模式。

   * - A *village area* is defined as a house or roadway in a village, town, or city.
     - *村莊區域*\ 是指村莊、城鎮或城市中的房屋或道路。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - There is a dukkaṭa in accepting staple or non-staple food with the purpose of eating it, and in accepting juice drinks, tonics, or medicine with the purpose of taking them as food; while there is a pāṭidesanīya for every mouthful of the staple or non-staple food one eats, and a dukkaṭa for every mouthful one takes of the juice drinks, tonics, or medicine for the sake of food.

     - 為了食用而接受主食或副食，為了當成食物食用而接受果汁飲料、補品或藥物，都犯《突吉羅》；而對於吃的每一口主食或副食則犯《應悔過》，以及為了當成食物而服用的每一口果汁飲料、補品或藥物，犯《突吉羅》。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - There is no offense if a bhikkhu accepts and eats food from a related bhikkhunī or from a female trainee or female novice, related or not. There is also no offense in the following situations even if the bhikkhunī is unrelated:

     - 比丘接受並食用與其有血緣關係的比丘尼，或從無論是否與其有血緣關係的學法女（式叉摩那）或沙彌尼提供的食物，並無犯戒。即使比丘尼與其無血緣關係，在下列情況下也無犯戒：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          She gets someone else to give him the food.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          她讓別人給他食物。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          She gives it by placing it near him (as in `NP 18`_ and `Pc 41`_).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          她把它放在他附近（如\ `《捨墮》一八`_\ 和\ `《波逸提》四一`_\ 裡）給他。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          She gives it to him in a monastery, nuns’ quarters, a dwelling of members of other sects, or on the way back from such places.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          她在寺院、尼姑住處、外道成員的住所，或是從這些地方返回的路上給他。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          She gives it to him after she has left the village.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          她離開村莊後給他。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          She gives him juice drinks, tonics, or medicine, and he uses them as such, rather than as food.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          她給他果汁飲料、補品或藥物，而他如是使用之，而不是當成食物。

   * - The Commentary contains a fairly extensive explanation of the second exemption here. To begin with, the bhikkhunī cannot give the food simply by placing it down. She also has to state that she is giving the food, and the bhikkhu has to state his acceptance. In its discussion of `Cv.X.15.1-2`_, the Commentary argues that food formally accepted by a bhikkhunī does not count as formally accepted for a bhikkhu, and vice versa. Thus, in the case of this exemption, even though the food has been given, the bhikkhu cannot take it until it has been formally offered. The Commentary states that the bhikkhunī can then formally offer it herself, but this would turn the exemption into a mere formality. What is more likely is that the food should be formally offered by someone else.

     - 《義註》對此處第二個豁免有相當詳盡的解釋。首先，比丘尼不能只把食物放下而給予食物。她也必須聲明自己正在給予食物，而比丘也必須聲明他接受。在\ `《小品》.十.15.1-2`_ 的討論中，《義註》論證說，比丘尼正式接受的食物不算是比丘正式接受的食物，反之亦然。因此，就此豁免的情況而言，即使食物已被給予，比丘也必須先經過正式供養才能拿它。《義註》說，比丘尼可以自己正式供養，但這會使該豁免淪為形式主義。更可能的是，食物應由他人正式供養。

   * - In all of these exemptions, the wise policy would be not to take so much of the bhikkhunī’s food that she is deprived of a full meal.
     - 在所有這些豁免情況下，明智之舉是不要拿走比丘尼太多的食物，以至於讓她無法吃飽飯。

   * - *Summary: Eating staple or non-staple food after having accepted it from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunī in a village area is a pāṭidesanīya offense.*
     - *摘要：在村莊地區，從一位與自己沒有血緣關係的比丘尼手中接受主食或副食後食用之，是《應悔過》罪。*

          *In case bhikkhus, being invited, are eating in family residences, and if a bhikkhunī is standing there as though giving directions, (saying,) “Give curry here, give rice here,” then the bhikkhus are to dismiss her: “Go away, sister, while the bhikkhus are eating.” If not one of the bhikkhus should speak to dismiss her, “Go away, sister, while the bhikkhus are eating,” the bhikkhus are to acknowledge it: “Friends, we have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that ought to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it.”*

     - .. container:: notification

          *若比丘們受邀在某戶人家用餐，而且如果一位比丘尼站在那裡，彷彿在指揮（，說）：「這裡給咖哩，這裡給米飯」，那麼比丘們應當請她離開：「姊妹，比丘們用餐時，走開。」若沒有比丘們開口請她離開：「姊妹，比丘們用餐時，走開。」比丘們應當悔過：「諸位朋友，我們犯了應受譴責的不當行為，應當悔過。我們悔過。」*

   * - This rule refers to situations where lay donors invite bhikkhus to a meal, and a bhikkhunī stands giving orders, based on favoritism, as to which bhikkhus should get which food. The duty of the bhikkhus in such cases is to tell her to go away before they accept any of the food. If even just one of them does, they all are exempt from the offense here. If none of them does, and the following factors are fulfilled, they all incur the penalty and must acknowledge their offense as a group.

     - 這條戒條指的是在家布施者邀請比丘們用餐，而一位比丘尼站在根據偏好發號施令，決定哪些比丘應該得到哪些食物的情況。在這種情況下，比丘們的義務是在接受任何食物之前告訴她走開。如果即使只有一位比丘這樣做，那麼所有人都免於犯此戒。如果所有人都沒有這樣做，並且滿足以下條件，那麼所有人都要受到懲罰，並且必須作為一個整體懺悔他們的過錯。

   * - If, instead of giving her orders in the bhikkhus’ presence, the bhikkhunī goes to the donors’ place and gives her orders prior to their arrival, then if the bhikkhus know of her actions, the case would come under `Pc 29`_.

     - 如果比丘尼沒有在比丘面前發號施令，而是前往布施者的地方，在他們到達之前發號施令，那麼如果比丘們知道她的行為，這種情況就屬於\ `《波逸提》二九`_\ 。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - As with the preceding rule, there are two objects here: the food and the bhikkhunī. Any one of the five staple foods received in the above situation would fulfill the food sub-factor. A bhikkhunī who has received double ordination would fulfill the bhikkhunī sub-factor. A bhikkhunī ordained only in the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha would be grounds for a dukkaṭa. If she has not been ordained, she is not grounds for an offense.

     - 與前一條戒條一樣，這裡也有兩個對象：食物和比丘尼。上述情況下所接受的五種主食中的任何一種都符合食物子因素。已兩部受戒的比丘尼符合比丘尼子因素。僅在比丘尼僧團受戒的比丘尼構成《突吉羅》。若她未受戒，則不構成犯戒。

   * - Perception as to whether she has been ordained is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pd 1`_).
     - 關於她是否已受戒的感知在這裡並不構成減輕懲罰的因素（見\ `《應悔過》一`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - There is a dukkaṭa in accepting the staple food received under such circumstances, and a pāṭidesanīya for every mouthful one eats.
     - 在這樣的情況下接受主食，犯《突吉羅》，吃的每一口食物犯一次《應悔過》。
