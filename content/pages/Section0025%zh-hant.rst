   * - *Pāṭidesanīya*
     - *應悔過*

   * - This term means “to be acknowledged.” As a name for training rules, it means “entailing acknowledgement.” The four training rules here are unique in that they mention, as part of the rule, the words to be used in acknowledging the violation; the second rule is especially unique in that it depicts the violators as acknowledging their offense as a group.

     - 這個術語的意思是「應被悔過」。作為學處的名稱，它的意思是「必須悔過」。這裡的四個學處的獨特之處在於，它們在戒條中明確列出了悔過違犯時應使用的措辭；第二條戒條尤其獨特，因為它將違犯者描述為以群體形式悔過其犯戒。

          *Should any bhikkhu chew or consume staple or non-staple food, having received it with his own hand from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunī in an inhabited area, he is to acknowledge it: “Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that ought to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”*

          *任何比丘若在俗家間，親手從沒有血緣關係的比丘尼手中接受主食或副食，並咀嚼或食用，他應當悔過：「諸位朋友，我犯了應受譴責的不當行為，應當悔過。我悔過。」*

   * - A long series of events led up to the formulation of this rule.
     - 一系列漫長事件導致了這條戒條的制定。

          “At that time a certain woman whose husband was away from home was made pregnant by her lover. She, having caused an abortion, said to a bhikkhunī who was dependent on her family for alms, ‘Come, lady, take this fetus away in your bowl.’ So the bhikkhunī, having placed the fetus in her bowl and covering it up with her outer robe, went away. Now at that time a certain alms-going bhikkhu had made this vow: ‘I won’t eat from the first almsfood I receive without having given some of it to a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī.’ Seeing the bhikkhunī, he said to her, ‘Come, sister, accept alms.’

          「\ `那時，一位丈夫不在家的女子被她的情夫弄懷孕了 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_020/#0357a02>`_\ 。她墮胎後，對一位靠她家供養缽食的比丘尼說：『來吧，女士，用你的缽把胎兒拿走。』比丘尼便將胎兒放入缽中，用外衣蓋好，離開了。當時，一位托缽乞食的比丘發了這樣一個願：『我得到的第一份缽食若不分一些給比丘或比丘尼，我就不吃。』他看見那位比丘尼，便對她說：『來吧，姊妹，接受缽食吧。』

          “(Of course the bhikkhu couldn’t help but tell his fellow bhikkhus, and word reached the Buddha, who formulated a double rule:) ‘A bhikkhunī should not take a fetus in a bowl…. I allow a bhikkhunī, when seeing a bhikkhu, to take out her bowl and show it to him.’

          「（當然，比丘忍不住將此事告訴了他的同伴比丘，消息傳到了佛陀那裡，佛陀制定了雙重戒條：）『比丘尼不應將胎兒放在缽中……我允許比丘尼在見到比丘時，拿出缽給他看。』

          “Now at that time some group-of-six bhikkhunīs, on seeing a bhikkhu, would turn their bowls upside down and show him the bottom side…. ‘I allow a bhikkhunī, when seeing a bhikkhu, to show him her bowl rightside up. And she is to offer him whatever food there is in the bowl.’”—Cv.X.13
