   * - **Four: The Food Chapter**
     - **第四 食物品**

   * - Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: *bhojana/bhojaniya* (consumables) and *khādaniya* (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term *staple* here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.

     - 本章中的許多戒條將食物分為兩類：\ *bhojana/bhojaniya*\ （噉食）和\ *khādaniya*\ （嚼食）。學者通常將兩者翻譯為「較軟的食物」和「較硬的食物」，儘管特定食物的軟硬程度與其所屬類別關係不大。更貼近每個類別本質的翻譯是「主食」和「副食」。兩者之間的差異至關重要，因為它往往是決定什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒的因素。但請注意，此處的「\ *主食*\ 」一詞僅涵蓋佛陀時代被認為是主食的食物。麵包、義大利麵和馬鈴薯在西方是主食，但在當時的印度並非一直都是主食，因此並不總是屬於這一類別。

       **Staple foods**

     - **主食（噉食）**

   * - Staple foods are consistently defined as five sorts of foods, although the precise definitions of the first two are a matter of controversy.
     - 主食一致地被定義為五種食物，儘管前兩種食物的精確定義存在爭議。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Cooked grains:* The Commentary to `Pc 35`_ defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are *sāḷi* (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); *vīhi* (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); *yava* (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); *godhūma* (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); *kaṅgu* (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); *varaka* (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and *kudrūsaka* (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）煮熟的穀物：*\ `《波逸提》三五`_\ 的《義註》將其定義為七種煮熟的穀物，但對於其中某些穀物的定義存在分歧。它們是 *sāḷi* （《戒律書》將其譯為米，泰國人譯為小麥）； *vīhi* （《戒律書》仍將其譯為米，泰國人也同意）； *yava* （《戒律書》將其譯為大麥，泰國人譯為糯米）； *godhūma* （《戒律書》將其譯為小麥，泰國佛教徒譯為稗子）； *kaṅgu* （《戒律書》和泰國人均將其譯為小米或高粱）； *varaka* （《戒律書》僅說其為豆類之外沒有確認，泰國人將其譯為薏米，這可能是正確的）；以及 *kudrūsaka* （《義註》將其定義為涵蓋所有來自草類的穀物——在西方，黑麥是一個例子）。然而，無論這些術語的確切定義是什麼，我們都可以從《四大教示》中論證，任何作為主食烹飪的穀物——包括玉米和燕麥——都屬於這一類。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Kummāsa:* The Commentary describes this as a staple confection made out of *yava* but doesn’t give any further details aside from saying that if the *kummāsa* is made out of any of the other grains or mung beans, it doesn’t count as a staple food. References to *kummāsa* in the Canon show that it was a very common staple that could form a rudimentary meal in and of itself and would spoil if left overnight.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）Kummāsa：*\ 《義註》將其描述為一種用 *yava* 製成的主食甜點，但除了指出如果 *kummāsa* 是用其他穀物或綠豆製成的，則不算主食之外，沒有提供更多細節。《聖典》中對 *kummāsa* 的引用表明，它是一種非常常見的主食，本身就可以作為一頓簡陋的飯菜，如果放置過夜就會變質。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *3) Sattu:* any of the seven types of grain dried or roasted and pounded into meal.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *3）Sattu：*\ 七種穀物中的任何一種，經過乾燥或烘烤後搗成粉。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *4) Fish:* the flesh of any animal living in the water.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *4）魚：*\ 任何生活在水裡的動物的肉。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *5) Meat:* the flesh of any animal living on land, except for that which is unallowable. Because the Commentary, in discussing unallowable meat, uses the word *meat* to cover all parts of an animal’s body, the same convention would apply to allowable meat (and to fish) as well. Thus it covers the liver, kidneys, eggs, etc., of any animal whose flesh is allowable.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *5）肉類：*\ 指任何陸地動物的肉，但禁止食用的除外。由於《義註》在討論禁止食用的肉類時，使用「\ *肉*\ 」一詞來指稱動物身體的所有部位，因此同樣的慣例也適用於允許食用的肉類（以及魚類）。因此，它涵蓋了任何允許食用的動物的肝臟、腎臟、蛋類等。

   * - The Mahāvagga (`Mv.VI.23.9-15`_) forbids ten kinds of flesh: that of human beings, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas. To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkaṭa. Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive (“People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting’”) or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion’s flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there, instead of criticizing or complaining, attacked them).

     - 《大品》（\ `《大品》.六.23.9-15`_\ ）禁食十種肉：人肉、象肉、馬肉、狗肉、蛇肉、獅肉、虎肉、豹肉、熊肉和鬣狗肉。食用人肉犯《偷蘭遮》；食用任何其他不被允許食用的肉則犯《突吉羅》。人肉、馬肉和象肉被認為過於尊貴，不宜食用。其他肉類被禁止食用，要麼是因為它們令人討厭（「人們批評、抱怨並四處傳播：『這些沙門釋迦子怎麼能吃狗肉？狗令人厭惡，令人作嘔』」），要麼是因為它們危險（比丘們，聞起來有獅子肉的味道，進入叢林；那裡的獅子沒有批評或抱怨，而攻擊了他們）。

   * - The Commentary adds three comments here: (a) These prohibitions cover not only the meat of these animals but also their blood, bones, skin, and hide (the layer of tissue just under the skin—see `AN 4:113`_). (b) The prohibition against dog flesh does not include wild dogs, such as wolves and foxes, (but many teachers—including the Thai translator of the Commentary—question this point). The flesh of a half-dog half-wolf mixture, however, would be forbidden. (c) The prohibition against snake flesh covers the flesh of all long, footless beings. Thus eels would not be allowed. (Many Communities question this last point as well.)

     - 《義註》在此補充了三點評論： (a) 這些禁令不僅涵蓋這些動物的肉，還涵蓋它們的血、骨、皮和獸皮（皮下組織層－參見\ `《增支部》4:113經`_\ ）。 (b) 禁止食用狗肉的規定並不包括狼和狐狸等野狗（但許多導師——包括《義註》的泰文譯者——對此表示質疑）。然而，半狗半狼混血的肉是被禁止的。 (c) 禁止食用蛇肉的規定涵蓋所有長而無足的生物的肉。因此，鰻魚是不允許的。（許多僧團也對最後一點表示質疑。）

   * - `Mv.VI.23.9`_ also states that if a bhikkhu is uncertain as to the identity of any meat presented to him, he incurs a dukkaṭa if he doesn’t ask the donor what it is before eating it. The Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, on reflection, one recognizes what kind of meat it is, one needn’t ask the donor about the identity of the meat. If one doesn’t recognize it, one *must* ask. If one mistakenly identifies an unallowable sort of meat as allowable and then goes ahead and consumes it under that mistaken assumption, there is no offense.

     - `《大品》.六.23.9`_ 也規定，如果比丘不確定提供給自己的肉是什麼，並且在食用前沒有詢問施主，犯《突吉羅》。《義註》對此的解釋是，如果經過深思熟慮後，認出了是什麼肉，就無需詢問施主是什麼肉。如果認不出，就\ *必須*\ 詢問。如果比丘錯誤地將不允許的肉認定為可允許的肉，並基於這種錯誤的認知繼續食用，則不構成犯戒。

   * - Raw flesh and blood are allowed at `Mv.VI.10.2`_ only when one is possessed by non-human beings. Thus, in more ordinary circumstances, one may not eat raw fish or meat even if of an allowable kind. This would include such things as steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, raw eggs, and caviar. Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (`Mv.VI.31.14`_).

     - 根據\ `《大品》.六.10.2`_\ ，只有當非人附身時，才允許食用生肉和血。因此，在更普遍的情況下，即使是允許的生魚或生肉，也不得食用。這包括韃靼牛排、生魚片、帶殼牡蠣、生蛋和魚子醬。此外，如果比丘看到、聽到或懷疑動物是專門為了供養比丘而宰殺的，即使是允許的熟魚或熟肉，也是不允許食用的（\ `《大品》.六.31.14`_\ ）。

     - 副食根據上下文定義：

          c\) in `Pc 41`_ (also the bhikkhunīs’ `Pc 44`_ & 54_): every edible aside from staple foods, the five tonics, juice drinks, medicine, and conjey.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          c）在\ `《波逸提》四一`_\ 中（也在\ `比丘尼《波逸提》四四`_\ 和\ `五四`_\ ）：除主食、五種補品、果汁飲料、藥物和粥之外的所有可食用物。

          .. conjey: Alternative spelling of congee (“rice gruel”) [Leave, formal permission for some action, (originally and particularly):]

   * - The Commentary to `Pc 37`_ lists the following items as non-staple foods: flour and confections made of flour (cakes, bread and pasta made without eggs would be classed here); also, roots, tubers (this would include potatoes), lotus roots, sprouts, stems, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, nuts, seed-meal, seeds, and resins that are made into food. Any of these items ordinarily used as medicines, though, would not be classed as a non-staple food.

     - `《波逸提》三七`_\ 的《義註》將以下物品列為副食：麵粉和麵粉製成的甜點（不含雞蛋的蛋糕、麵包和義大利麵也歸入此類）；此外，根、塊莖（包括馬鈴薯）、蓮藕、芽、莖、樹皮、葉子、花、果實、堅果、種子粉、種子以及製成食物的樹脂。然而，任何這些通常用作藥物之物均不屬於副食。

   * - The Commentary also acknowledges that some societies use roots, tubers, confections made out of flour, etc., as staple foods, but it nowhere suggests that the definition of staple food be altered to fit the society in which one is living. However—because eggs come under meat—any bread, pastries, noodles, and pasta made with eggs are staple foods. Thus in the West we are left with a somewhat zigzag line separating what are and are not staple foods for the purposes of the rules: Meal pounded from grain is a staple; flour ground from grain is not. Bread made with oat meal, corn meal, wheat germ, etc., would thus be a staple; bread made without any grain meal or eggs would not. The same holds true for pastries, noodles, and pasta.

     - 《義註》也承認有些社會使用根莖類植物、麵粉製成的甜點等作為主食，但並未暗示應根據個人所處的社會環境改變主食的定義。然而，由於雞蛋屬於肉類，任何用雞蛋製成的麵包、糕點、麵條和義大利麵都屬於主食。因此，在西方，就戒條而言，主食和副食的劃分存在一條略顯曲折的界線：穀物搗碎的粗糧是主食；穀物磨成的麵粉則不是。因此，用燕麥粉、玉米粉、小麥胚芽等製成的麵包是主食；不含穀物粉或雞蛋的麵包則不是主食。糕點、麵條和義大利麵也是如此。

   * - This means that it would be possible for a donor to provide bhikkhus with a full, strictly vegetarian meal that would include absolutely no staple foods. A wise policy in such a case, though, would be to treat the meal as if it did contain staple foods with reference to the rules (`Pc 33`_ & 35_) that aim at saving face for the donor.

     - 這意味著，布施者可以為比丘提供一頓完整的、純素食的餐食，其中完全不含任何主食。然而，在這種情況下，明智的做法是，參照\ `《波逸提》三三`_\ 和\ `三五`_\ 的戒條，將這頓餐食視為如同包含主食，以維護布施者的面子。

   * - Conjey, the watery rice porridge or gruel commonly drunk before alms round in the time of the Buddha, is classed differently according to context. If it is so thick that it cannot be drunk and must be eaten with a spoon, it is regarded as a staple food at `Mv.VI.25.7`_ and under `Pc 33`_. “Drinking conjey” is classed as a non-staple food under `Pc 35-38`_ & 40_, whereas it is considered neither a staple nor a non-staple food under `Pc 41`_. The Commentary notes, though, that if drinking conjey has bits of meat or fish “larger than lettuce seeds” floating in it, it is a staple food.

     - 粥（conjey）是佛陀時代托缽前常喝的一種含水米粥，根據上下文有不同的分類。如果它太濃稠，無法直接飲用，必須用湯匙食用，則在\ `《大品》.六.25.7`_\ 和\ `《波逸提》三三`_\ 中被視為主食。「飲用粥」在\ `《波逸提》三五至三八`_\ 和\ `四十`_\ 中被歸類為副食，而在\ `《波逸提》四一`_\ 中，它既不被視為主食，也不被視為副食。然而，《義註》指出，如果飲用粥中漂浮著「比生菜種子還大」的肉碎或魚碎，它就是主食。

   * - `Mv.VI.34.21`_ contains an allowance for the five products of the cow: milk, curds, buttermilk, butter, and ghee. The Commentary mentions that each of these five may be taken separately—i.e., the allowance does not mean that all five must be taken together. Milk and curds are classed as “finer staple foods” under `Pc 39`_, but in other contexts they fit under the definition of non-staple food. All other dairy products—except for fresh butter and ghee when used as tonics (see `NP 23`_)—are non-staple foods.

     - `《大品》.六.34.21`_ 規定了五種牛製品的開緣：牛奶、凝乳、酪乳、奶油和酥油。《義註》中提到，這五種產品的任一種可以單獨食用——也就是說，開緣並不意味著必須同時食用所有五種。在\ `《波逸提》三九`_\ 下，牛奶和凝乳被歸類為「精細主食」，但在其他上下文脈絡之下，它們符合副食的定義。所有其他乳製品——除了用作補品的新鮮奶油和酥油（參見\ `《捨墮》二三`_\ ）——都屬於副食。

   * - One of the ten disputed points that led to the convening of the Second Council was the issue of whether thin sour milk—milk that has passed the state of being milk but not yet arrived at the state of being buttermilk—would count inside or outside the general category of staple/non-staple food under `Pc 35`_. The decision of the Council was that it was inside the category, and thus a bhikkhu who has turned down an offer of further food would commit the offense under that rule if he later in the morning consumed thin sour milk that was not left over.

     - 導致\ `第二次結集`_\ 的\ `十個爭議點`_\ 之一是稀酸奶（已經過了牛奶狀態但還未達到酪乳狀態的牛奶）是否應在\ `《波逸提》三五`_\ 之下算在主食/副食的一般類別之內或之外的問題。結集的決議是，它屬於這一類別，因此，如果一位比丘拒絕了進一步的食物供養，並且之後的早上喝了非剩餘的稀酸奶，他將根據該戒條而犯戒。

   * - In addition to staple and non-staple foods, the Vibhaṅga to the rules in this chapter mentions three other classes of edibles: juice drinks, the five tonics, and medicines.

     - 除了主食和副食之外，本品的戒條的《經分別》還提到了其他三類食用物：果汁飲料、五種補品和藥物。

       **Juice drinks**

     - **果汁飲料**

   * - Juice drinks include the freshly squeezed juice of sugar cane, water lily root, all fruits except grain, all leaves except cooked greens, and all flowers except licorice (`Mv.VI.35.6`_). The way the allowance for juice drinks is phrased—fruits, leaves, and flowers are mentioned as a class, whereas canes and roots are not—suggests that the Great Standards should not be used to extend the allowance for sugar cane juice and water lily root juice to include the juice from other canes or roots.

     - 果汁飲料包括鮮榨甘蔗汁、睡蓮根汁、除穀物外的所有水果、除煮熟的綠葉蔬菜外的所有葉子以及除甘草外的所有花卉（\ `《大品》.六.35.6`_\ ）。果汁飲料的開緣的表述方式——水果、葉子和花卉以類別方式被提及，而藤蔓和根莖則不是——表明不應用《四大教示》將甘蔗汁和睡蓮根汁的開緣擴大到其他藤蔓或根莖的汁液。
