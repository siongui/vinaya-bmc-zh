   * - **Four: The Food Chapter**
     - **第四 食物品**

   * - Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: *bhojana/bhojaniya* (consumables) and *khādaniya* (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term *staple* here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.

     - 本章中的許多戒條將食物分為兩類：\ *bhojana/bhojaniya*\ （噉食）和\ *khādaniya*\ （嚼食）。學者通常將兩者翻譯為「較軟的食物」和「較硬的食物」，儘管特定食物的軟硬程度與其所屬類別關係不大。更貼近每個類別本質的翻譯是「主食」和「副食」。兩者之間的差異至關重要，因為它往往是決定什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒的因素。但請注意，此處的「\ *主食*\ 」一詞僅涵蓋佛陀時代被認為是主食的食物。麵包、義大利麵和馬鈴薯在西方是主食，但在當時的印度並非一直都是主食，因此並不總是屬於這一類別。

   * - **Staple foods**
     - **主食（噉食）**

   * - Staple foods are consistently defined as five sorts of foods, although the precise definitions of the first two are a matter of controversy.
     - 主食一致地被定義為五種食物，儘管前兩種食物的精確定義存在爭議。

          *1) Cooked grains:* The Commentary to `Pc 35`_ defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are *sāḷi* (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); *vīhi* (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); *yava* (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); *godhūma* (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); *kaṅgu* (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); *varaka* (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and *kudrūsaka* (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.

          *1）煮熟的穀物：*\ `《波逸提》三五`_\ 的《義註》將其定義為七種煮熟的穀物，但對於其中某些穀物的定義存在分歧。它們是 *sāḷi* （《戒律書》將其譯為米，泰國人譯為小麥）； *vīhi* （《戒律書》仍將其譯為米，泰國人也同意）； *yava* （《戒律書》將其譯為大麥，泰國人譯為糯米）； *godhūma* （《戒律書》將其譯為小麥，泰國佛教徒譯為稗子）； *kaṅgu* （《戒律書》和泰國人均將其譯為小米或高粱）； *varaka* （《戒律書》僅說其為豆類之外沒有確認，泰國人將其譯為薏米，這可能是正確的）；以及 *kudrūsaka* （《義註》將其定義為涵蓋所有來自草類的穀物——在西方，黑麥是一個例子）。然而，無論這些術語的確切定義是什麼，我們都可以從《四大教示》中論證，任何作為主食烹飪的穀物——包括玉米和燕麥——都屬於這一類。
