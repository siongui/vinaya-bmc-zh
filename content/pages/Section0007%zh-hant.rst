   * - The Pāṭimokkha is available to us in several recensions, some in Indic languages, others in Tibetan or Chinese translations. However, of the Indic recensions, only one—the Pali—is still a living tradition, recited fortnightly and put into practice by Theravādin bhikkhus throughout the world. This is the recension translated and explained in this book.

     - 我們可以找到《波羅提木叉》的多種修訂版本，其中一些是印度語，另一些是藏語或漢語翻譯。然而，在印度語修訂本中，只有一個——巴利語——是仍然存在的的傳統，每半月背誦一次，並被世界各地的上座部比丘付諸實踐。這是本書中翻譯和詮釋的修訂版。

   * - The meaning of the term *pāṭimokkha* is a matter of conjecture. According to the Mahāvagga it means “the beginning, the head (or entrance—*mukha*), the foremost (*pamukha*) of skillful qualities” (`Mv.II.3.4`_). The term serves as the name not only of the basic code of training rules, but also of a sermon in which the Buddha enumerated the basic principles common to the teachings of all Buddhas: “The non-doing of all evil, the performance of what is skillful, and the purification of one’s mind: This is the Buddhas’ message” (`Dhp 183`_). Thus whatever the etymology of the term *pāṭimokkha*, it denotes a set of principles basic to the practice of the religion.

     - 「\ *波羅提木叉*\ 」一詞的意思是一個猜想。根據《大品》，它的意思是「諸善法的開始、頭（或入口－\ *mukha*\ ）、首要的（\ *pamukha*\ ）」（\ `《大品》.二.3.4`_\ ）。這個術語不僅是學處的基本準則的名稱，也是佛陀在一次說法中列舉了所有佛陀教義所共有的基本原則的名稱：「諸惡莫作，眾善奉行，自淨其意：是諸佛教」（\ `《法句》一八三`_\ ）。 因此，無論「\ *波羅提木叉*\ 」一詞的字源是什麼，它都表示宗教實踐的一套基本原則。

          「波羅提木叉」者，是諸善法元，是面，是首，故名「波羅提木叉」。

   * - The basic code of training rules for bhikkhus, in its Pali recension, contains 227 rules divided into eight sections in accordance with the penalty assigned by each rule: *pārājika*, defeat; *saṅghādisesa*, formal meeting; *aniyata*, indefinite; *nissaggiya pācittiya*, forfeiture and confession; *pācittiya*, confession; *pāṭidesanīya*, acknowledgement; *sekhiya*, training; and *adhikaraṇa-samatha*, settling of issues. The following chapters will discuss the precise meanings of these terms.

     - 比丘學處的基本法典，在其巴利文修訂本中，包含 227 條戒條，根據每條戒條所規定的懲罰，分為八個部分：《波羅夷》(*pārājika*)，驅擯；《僧殘》(*saṅghādisesa*)，正式會議；《不定》(*aniyata*)，不定；《尼薩耆波逸提》(*nissaggiya pācittiya*)，捨出並懺悔；《波逸提》(*pācittiya*)，懺悔；《應悔過》(*pāṭidesaniya*)，應悔過；《應學》(*sekhiya*)，應當學；以及《滅諍》(*adhikaraṇa-samatha*)，滅諍。以下章節將討論這些術語的確切含義。

   * - Three of these terms, though, do not denote penalties. The aniyata rules give directions for judging uncertain cases; the sekhiya rules simply say, “(This is) a training to be followed,” without assigning a particular penalty for not following them; and the adhikaraṇa-samatha rules give procedures to follow in settling issues that may arise in the Community. Thus there are only five types of penalty mentioned in the Pāṭimokkha rules themselves, ranging from permanent expulsion from the Community to simple confession in the presence of another bhikkhu. None of the penalties, we should note, involve physical punishment of any kind. And we should further note that the purpose of undergoing the penalties is not somehow to absolve one from guilt or to erase any bad kamma one may incur by breaking the rules. Rather, the purpose is both personal and social: to strengthen one’s resolve to refrain from such behavior in the future, and to reassure one’s fellow bhikkhus that one is still serious about following the training.

     - 不過，其中三個術語並不表示懲罰。《不定》(aniyata)戒條為判斷不確定的情況提供了指引；《應學》(sekhiya)戒條只是說：“（這是）需要遵循的訓練”，但沒有對不遵循這些戒條的行為給予特定的處罰；《滅諍》(adhikaraṇa-samatha)戒條給出了解決僧團中可能出現的諍論時應遵循的程序。因此，《波羅提木叉》戒條本身只提到五種懲罰，從永久驅逐出僧團到在另一比丘在場的情況下簡單懺悔。我們應該注意到，所有懲罰都不涉及任何形式的體罰。我們更應該注意到，接受懲罰的目的並不是要以某種方式開脫免罪或消除因違反戒條而可能招致的任何惡業。相反，其目的既是個人的，也是社會交際的：加強一個人今後不再做出這種行為的決心，並向比丘同儕保證他仍然認真地遵守訓練。

   * - In addition to the penalties directly mentioned in the rules, there are also penalties derived from the rules by the Vibhaṅga and commentaries. These derived penalties deal with two sorts of cases: 1) A bhikkhu tries to commit an action mentioned in one of the rules, but the action for one reason or another does not reach completion (e.g., he tries to kill a person, but the person doesn’t die). 2) A bhikkhu commits an action not directly covered in any rule, but similar to one that is (e.g., he strikes an unordained person, which is not directly covered in a rule, while the act of striking a bhikkhu is).

     - 除了戒條中直接提到的懲罰之外，還有根據《經分別》和註釋從戒條中衍生出來的懲罰。這些衍生的懲罰涉及兩種情況： 1) 比丘試圖實施其中一項戒條中提到的行為，但由於某種原因該行為沒有完成（例如，他試圖殺人，但人沒死）。 2) 比丘犯下任何戒條沒有直接涵蓋的行為，但類似於戒律所直接涵蓋的行為（例如，他毆打未出家的人，這不是戒條直接涵蓋的行為，而毆打比丘的行為卻是戒律直接涵蓋的行為）。

   * - Penalties of this sort, when derived from the pārājika and saṅghādisesa rules, include thullaccaya (grave offense) and dukkaṭa (wrong doing); those derived from the nissaggiya pācittiya, pācittiya, and pāṭidesanīya rules—except for the rule against insults—include only the dukkaṭa. The penalties derived from the rule against insults include dubbhāsita (wrong speech) as well. As for the sekhiya rules, the Vibhaṅga states that to disobey any of them out of disrespect entails a dukkaṭa. All of these derived penalties may be cleared through confession.

     - 此類處罰源自《波羅夷》和《僧殘》戒條，包括\ `《偷蘭遮》`_\ (thullaccaya)（重罪）和\ `《突吉羅》`_\ (dukkaṭa)（惡作）；源自《尼薩耆波逸提》、《波逸提》和《應悔過》戒條的懲罰（除了禁止侮辱的戒條之外）僅包括《突吉羅》。來自侮辱戒條的懲罰還包括 dubbhāsita（惡說）。至於《應學》戒條，《經分別》規定，出於不尊重而違反任何戒條都會導致《突吉羅》。所有這些衍生的懲罰都可以透過認罪懺悔來消除。

   * - There may, of course, be times when the assigned penalties are not enough to deter an unconscientious bhikkhu from committing an offense repeatedly. In such cases, the Community in which he is living may, if it sees fit, formally impose additional penalties on him as a means of bringing him into line. These transactions range from stripping him of some of the privileges of seniority, to banishment from that particular Community, and on to suspension from the Bhikkhu Saṅgha as a whole. In each case the punishment is temporary; if the bhikkhu realizes his errors and mends his ways, the Community is to revoke the act against him and return him to his former status. These punishments are treated in detail in `BMC2, Chapter 20`_.

     - 當然，有時所規定的懲罰不足以阻止不負責任的比丘重複犯罪。在這種情況下，他所居住的僧團如果認為合適，可以正式對他施加額外的處罰，作為讓他遵守戒條的手段。這些羯磨的範圍從剝奪他的一些戒臘特權，到將他逐出特定的僧團，再到暫停他在整個比丘僧伽中的資格\ :small:`（漢譯註：此處suspension的懲罰古譯為舉罪，和英文字面意思完全不同）`\ 。在每種情況下，懲罰都是暫時的；如果比丘認識到自己的錯誤並改過自新，僧團將撤銷針對他的處分，並將他恢復到原來的狀態。\ `《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章 <https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20>`_\ 詳細討論了這些懲罰。

   * - Thus, taken as a whole, the Vinaya’s system of penalties makes use of three basic principles—confession, forfeiture, and various degrees of ostracism from the Community—as means of enforcing the rules. To understand the wisdom of this system, it is important to realize how each of these principles is related to the practice of the Dhamma and the training of the mind.

     - 因此，從整體來看，戒律的懲罰制度利用了三個基本原則──懺悔、捨出，和不同程度的僧團排斥──作為執行戒條的手段。要了解這個系統的智慧，重要的是要了解這些原則中的每一個是如何與佛法的修行和心靈的訓練相關的。

   * - *Confession*: There are several spots in the discourses (e.g., `DN 2`_, `MN 140`_) where the Buddha states, “It is a cause of growth in the Dhamma and discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression (of one’s own) as a transgression, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future.” From the context each time the Buddha makes this statement, it is clear that “makes amends” means confessing one’s mistakes. In another passage (`MN 61`_), the Buddha informs his son, Rāhula, that if one sees that one’s words or deeds have harmed oneself or others, one should confess them to a knowledgeable companion in the celibate life. All those who have purified their thoughts, words, and deeds in the past, all those who are doing so in the present, and all those who will do so in the future, he adds, have acted, are acting, and will act in just this way. In addition, one of the basic requisites for exerting oneself in the practice is that one not be fraudulent or deceitful, and that one declare oneself to one’s knowledgeable companions in the celibate life in line with one’s actual behavior (`AN 5:53`_). Thus a willingness to confess one’s misdeeds is an essential factor in progress along the path.

     - *懺悔*\ ：在佛陀的開示中（例如，\ `《長部》2經`_\ 、\ `《中部》140經`_\ ）中有幾處指出：“凡是對（自己的）罪過見到是罪過後，依法改過，並在未來約束自己，是在聖者之法與律中增長的原因” 從佛陀每次做此聲明的上下文來看，「改過」顯然就是承認並懺悔自己的錯誤。在另一段經文（\ `《中部》61經`_\ ）中，佛陀告訴他的兒子羅睺羅，如果一個人看到自己的言語或行為傷害了自己或他人，應該向梵行生活中一位有知識的同伴懺悔。他補充說，所有那些在過去淨化了自己的思想、言語和行為的人，所有現在正在這樣做的人，以及所有未來將這樣做的人，無論已經做過、正在做、將會做。都是如此。另外，精進修行的基本條件之一，就是不弄虛作假詐欺或欺騙，向梵行生活中的有知識的同伴表明自己的實際行為（\ `《增支部》5:53經`_\ ）。因此，願意承認自己的錯誤行為是在這條道路上取得進步的必要因素。

   * - *Forfeiture*, in most cases, is simply a symbolic adjunct to confession. One forfeits the object in question, confesses the offense, and then receives the object in return. In a few cases, though—where the object is improper for a bhikkhu to use or own—one must break it or forfeit it for good. In these cases, forfeiture serves as a check against greed and as a reminder of two essential principles—contentment with little and modesty—that the Buddha extolled to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī (`AN 8:53`_) as absolutely basic to the practice. In particular, `AN 4:28`_ identifies contentment as one of the basic traditions of the noble ones, the essential culture of the religion as a whole.

     - *捨出*\ ：在大多數情況下，只是懺悔的象徵性附屬補充。一個人捨出相關物品，承認罪行懺悔，然後收到該物品歸還。然而，在少數情況下，當該物品不適合比丘使用或擁有時，必須將其破壞或永久放棄。在這些情況下，捨出可以抑制貪婪，並提醒我們兩個基本原則——知足於少量和謙虛——佛陀向摩訶波闍波提瞿曇彌(\ `《增支部》8:53經`_\ ) 稱讚這兩條原則是修行的絕對基礎。特別是，\ `《增支部》4:28經`_\ 將知足視為聖者的基本傳統之一，也是整個宗教的必要文化。

   * - *Ostracism*: In a famous passage (`SN 45:2`_), the Buddha tells Ven. Ānanda, “Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is the entirety of the celibate life. When a bhikkhu has admirable people as friends, companions, and comrades, he can be expected to develop and pursue the noble eightfold path.” Thus one of the few things a bhikkhu serious about the practice would naturally fear would be to be ostracized by the well-behaved members of the Community, for that would be a true barrier to his spiritual progress. This fear would then help deter him from any action that might entail such ostracism.

     - 排斥：在一個著名的段落（\ `《相應部》45:2經`_\ ）中，佛陀告訴阿難尊者：「令人敬佩的友誼、令人敬佩的陪伴、令人敬佩的友情是梵行生活的全部。當比丘擁有令人欽佩的人作為朋友、同伴和同志時，他就可以期望發展並追求八聖道。” 因此，認真修行的比丘自然會擔心的少數事情之一就是被僧團中表現良好的成員排斥，因為這將是他靈性進步的真正障礙。這種恐懼將有助於阻止他採取任何可能導致這種排斥的行動。

   * - In this way, the Vinaya’s system of penalties provides rehabilitation for offenders and deterrence against offenses—with confession the means of rehabilitation, and ostracism the deterrent—growing directly out of principles basic to the practice of the Dhamma.

     - 這樣，戒律的懲罰制度為犯戒者提供了恢復清淨，並威懾了犯戒者——懺悔是恢復清淨的手段，排斥則是威懾——直接源於佛法修行的基本原則。

   * - **Offenses**
     - **犯戒**

   * - In analyzing offenses for the purpose of determining penalties, the Vibhaṅga divides an action into five factors: the *effort*, the *perception* under which it is made, the *intention* motivating it, the *object* at which it is aimed, and the *result*. In some of the rules, all five factors play a role in determining what is and is not a full offense. In others, only two, three, or four play a role. For example, under the pārājika rule forbidding murder, all five factors have to be present for a full offense: The object has to be a human being, the bhikkhu has to perceive him/her as a living being, he has to have murderous intent, he has to make an effort for the person to die, and the person has to die.

     - 在分析犯戒以確定懲罰時，《經分別》將行為分為五個因素：\ *努力*\ 、做出行為的\ *感知*\ 、動機的\ *意圖*\ 、它所針對的\ *對象*\ ，和\ *結果*\ 。在某些戒條中，所有五個因素都在決定是否完整違犯發揮作用。在其他情況下，只有兩個、三個或四個發揮作用。例如，根據禁止謀殺的《波羅夷》戒條，完全違犯必須具備所有五個因素：對象必須是人，比丘必須將他/她視為活人，他必須有謀殺意圖，他必須努力讓人死，而人也必須死。
