          “A certain Āḷavī bhikkhu was chopping down a tree. The devatā living in the tree said to the bhikkhu, ‘Venerable sir, do not chop down my home to build a home for yourself.’ The bhikkhu, disregarding her, kept right on chopping and injured the arm of the devatā’s child. The devatā thought: ‘What if I were to kill this bhikkhu right here?’ Then another thought occurred to her: ‘But no, that wouldn’t be proper…. What if I were to tell the Blessed One of what has happened?’ So she went to the Blessed One and… told him of what had happened.

          「\ `有一位阿羅毘比丘正在砍樹 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0043a13>`_\ 。住在樹上的天女對比丘說：『大德，不要砍倒我的房子來為自己建造房子。』比丘不理會她，繼續砍樹，弄傷了天女孩子的手臂。天女想：『如果我就在這裡殺死這位比丘會怎麼樣？』然後她又想到：「但不，那樣不合適......如果我把所發生的事告訴世尊呢？』於是她去找世尊並......告訴他所發生的事。

          “‘Very good, devatā, very good. It’s very good that you didn’t kill the bhikkhu. If you had killed him today, you would have produced much demerit for yourself. Now go, devatā. Over there is a vacant tree. Go into it.’ (The Commentary adds here that the tree, being in Jeta’s Grove, was a definite move up for the devatā. She had a front-row seat for overhearing the Buddha’s teachings well into the night; unlike other lesser devas she wasn’t pushed out to the far reaches of the galaxy when large groups of major devas met with the Buddha; and when the Four Great Kings came to attend to the Buddha, they always made a point of visiting her before leaving. However:)

          「人們批評、抱怨並四處散播，『這些沙門釋子怎麼能砍伐樹木並讓人砍伐？他們虐待一根之命。』」

   * - This is another offense with the four factors of object, effort, perception, and intention.
     - 此為另一個具有對象、努力、感知、意圖四個因素的犯戒。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Pali term for living plant—\ *bhūtagāma*\ —literally means the home of a being. This the Sub-commentary explains by saying that devatās may take up residence in plants standing in place by means of a longing on which their consciousness fastens (at the end of their previous lives) as in a dream. This rule is justified, it says, in that the etiquette of a contemplative precludes doing harm to the abodes of living beings. As the origin story shows, though, the reason this rule was laid down in the first place was to prevent bhikkhus from offending people who held to the animist belief that regarded plants as one-facultied life having the sense of touch.

     - 巴利語中表示活體植物的字——bhūtagāma——字面意思是生物的家。《複註》對此作出了解釋，說天神可以透過渴望而居住在站立的植物中，他們的意識（在前世結束時）依附於此，就像在夢中一樣。它說，本戒條是合理的，因為沙門的威儀禁止傷害生物的居所。然而，正如起源故事所示，制定這條戒條的初衷是為了防止比丘冒犯那些持有萬物有靈論信仰的人，他們認為植物是具有觸覺的單能生命。

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *bhūtagāma* as vegetation arising from any of five sources:
     - 《經分別》將 *bhūtagāma* 定義為來自以下五個來源之一的植物：

          5\) from seeds (e.g., corn, beans).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          5）來自種子（例如玉米、豆類）。

   * - According to the Commentary, a whole plant or part of one that has been removed from its original place is no longer classed as bhūtagāma. If it is capable of growing again when placed in the ground, it is classed as *bījagāma*, which means “home of a seed.” When a seed is sown, it is regarded as bījagāma until the first shoot turns a fresh green color and the first leaf appears. After that it is regarded as bhūtagāma.

     - 根據《義註》，從原處移走的整株植物或植物的一部分不再被歸類為 bhūtagāma。如果它被放入土中後能夠再次生長，它就被歸類為 *bījagāma*\，意思是「種子的家」。當一顆種子被播下時，它被視為 bījagāma，直到第一根嫩芽變成新鮮的綠色並且長出第一片葉子。此後，它被視為 bhūtagāma。

   * - In line with this criterion, the Commentary classifies as bījagāma such lower forms of plant life as mushrooms that still have their spores, fungi, lichens without leaves, and molds, in that they do not pass through a fresh green stage, have no discernable leaves, and yet are capable of regeneration. Mushrooms that have lost their spores, and parts of any plants that have been removed from place and will not grow, or that have been cooked or otherwise damaged to the point where they are incapable of generation, are not grounds for an offense under this rule.

     - 根據這個標準，《義註》將一些較低級的植物生命形式歸類為 bījagāma，如仍有孢子的蘑菇、真菌、無葉地衣和黴菌，因為它們不會經歷新鮮的綠色階段，沒有可辨別的葉子，但具有再生能力。已經失去孢子的蘑菇，以及任何被移走而無法生長的植物的部分，或者已經被煮熟或以其他方式損壞到無法繁殖的程度的植物的部分，都不屬於根據本戒條犯戒的理由。

   * - The Commentary asserts further that to damage bījagāma entails a dukkaṭa. The Vibhaṅga does not mention this point, but the Commentary cites as its justification a passage occurring in a number of suttas (such as `DN 2`_) saying that a bhikkhu consummate in virtue refrains from harming both bhūtagāma and bījagāma. In doing so, the Commentary is utilizing the Cullavagga’s blanket rule assigning a dukkaṭa to all bad habits (`Cv.V.36`_). The Mahāvagga and Cullavagga give further but partial justification to the Commentary’s assertion in two passages, dealing with bhikkhus eating fruit, which we will discuss below. The Jain ascetics follow similar observances, which suggests that both the Buddhists and the Jains adopted this point from the ancient Indian ascetics who predated both religions.

     - 《義註》進一步指出，損壞 bījagāma 會導致《突吉羅》。《經分別》並沒有提到這一點，但《義註》引用了多部經典（如\ `《長部》2經`_\ ）中的出現的一段話作為其依據，這段話指出，戒德圓滿的比丘不會傷害 bhūtagāma 和 bījagāma 。在這樣做時，《義註》利用了《小品》的總括戒條，所有不良習慣都違犯《突吉羅》（\ `《小品》.五.36`_\ ）。《大品》和《小品》在兩段關於比丘吃水果的段落中對《義註》的斷言提供了進一步但部分的證明，我們將在下面討論。耆那教苦行者也遵循類似的戒律，顯示佛教徒和耆那教徒都從早於這兩種宗教的古印度苦行者那裡採納了這一觀點。

   * - Furthermore, according to the Commentary, there are certain kinds of plants that do not count either as bhūtagāma or bījagāma under this rule, and to damage them entails no offense. To justify this point it quotes a passage from `Cv.VIII.1.3`_: “If a wall treated with ochre… (or) a finished floor is moldy (§), one should moisten a rag, wring it out, and wipe it clean.” The Commentary extends the Canon’s instructions here to cover not only mold on walls but also other lower forms of plant life—such as algae on the inside of water jars, fungus on toothbrushes, and mold on food—that would count as filth if they were allowed to continue growing.

     - 此外，根據《義註》，有些植物根據這條戒條既不算是 bhūtagāma，也不算是 bījagāma，損壞它們並不構成犯戒。為了證明這一點，它引用了\ `《小品》.八.1.3`_ 中的一段話：「如果用赭石處理過的牆壁……（或）所作地面發霉了（§），則應將抹布弄濕，擰乾，然後擦拭乾淨。」《義註》擴展了《聖典》的指示，不僅涵蓋了牆壁上的黴菌，還涵蓋了其他低等植物生命形式—例如水罐內部的藻類、牙刷上的真菌和食物上的黴菌—如果允許它們繼續生長，則將被視為污穢。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, the term *damaging* includes such actions as cutting, breaking, and cooking, as well as getting other people to perform these actions. The Commentary defines *damaging* as “dealing with a plant as one likes by cutting it, breaking it, and so on.” Although the word for *dealing with*\—\ *paribhuñjati*\—literally means “making use of,” the Commentary’s illustrations of what this covers include even such things as shaking a tree limb to get the dry leaves to fall off so that one can sweep them up. Thus, it says, *damaging* would include picking flowers or leaves, uprooting a plant, engraving one’s initials in a tree trunk, etc. Because no exception is made for doing such things with “benevolent” intentions toward the plant, pruning would be included as well. Given the catch-all nature of the Commentary’s definition, using herbicides to kill plants would also come under *damaging*.

     - 根據《經分別》，\ *損害*\ 包括切割、破壞、烹飪等行為，以及讓其他人執行這些行為。《義註》將\ *損害*\ 定義為「以切割、破壞等方式隨意對待植物」。儘管表示\ *對待—paribhuñjati*\—的單字字面意思是「利用」，《義註》中對此內容的說明甚至包括諸如搖晃樹枝讓乾樹葉掉落以便可以將其掃起之類的事情。因此，它說，\ *損害*\ 包括採摘花朵或葉子、拔除植物、在樹幹上刻上自己的姓名首字母等。因為對植物懷著「仁慈的」意圖做這些事沒有豁免，所以修剪也包括在內。鑑於《義註》定義的包羅萬象性，使用除草劑殺死植物也算\ *損害*\ 。

   * - The Commentary adds that plants growing in water, such as water hyacinths, whose roots do not extend to the earth beneath the water, have the water as their base. To remove them from the water is to damage them, although there is no offense in moving them around in the water. To move them from one body of water to another without incurring a penalty, one may take them together with some of the water in which they originally lived and place them together with that water into the new body of water.

     - 《義註》還補充道，水葫蘆等生長在水中的植物，其根部不會延伸到水下的土地，而是以水為基部。將它們從水中取出是損害它們，儘管在水中移動它們並沒有犯戒。為了將它們從一個水域移到另一個水域而不受到懲罰，可以將它們連同它們原來生活的部分水一起帶入新的水域。

   * - Also, says the Commentary, plants such as mistletoe, orchids, and bird vine that grow on trees have the tree as their base. To remove them from the tree is to damage them and so entails a pācittiya.

     - 此外，《義註》還說，槲寄生、蘭花和鳥藤等生長在樹上的植物都以樹為基礎。把它們從樹上摘下來就會對它們造成損害，因此犯《波逸提》。

   * - **Perception**
     - **感知**

   * - If one damages a living plant (§) perceiving it to be something else—say, a dead plant—there is no offense. If one damages a plant in doubt as to whether it is living or dead, then regardless of what it actually is, the offense is a dukkaṭa.

     - 如果將一株活的植物（§）視為別的東西（例如，一株死的植物）而對其進行了損害，這並不構成犯戒。如果因懷疑植物是死是活而對其進行損害，那麼無論該植物實際上是什麼，罪行都是《突吉羅》。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - Intention is discussed in detail under the non-offenses, below.
     - 下文的不犯條款將詳細討論意圖。

   * - **Making fruit allowable**
     - **作淨水果**

   * - Because fruit seeds are bījagāma, the question arises as to how bhikkhus should go about eating fruit. The Commentary to this rule discusses in detail two passages, one each in the Mahāvagga (VI. 21) and the Cullavagga (V.5.2), dealing with precisely this question. The Cullavagga passage reads, “I allow you, bhikkhus, to consume fruit that has been made allowable for monks in any of five ways: if it is damaged by fire, by a knife, by a fingernail, if it is seedless, and the fifth is if the seeds are discharged.” The Mahāvagga passage reads, “Now at that time there was a great quantity of fruit at Sāvatthī, but there was no one to make it allowable…. (The Buddha said,) ‘I allow that fruit that is seedless or whose seeds are discharged be consumed (even if) it has not been made allowable.”

     - 因為水果種子是 bījagāma，所以就出現了比丘應該如何吃水果的問題。本戒條的《義註》詳細討論了兩個段落，一段在\ `《大品》（六.21）`_\ ，一段在\ `《小品》（五.5.2）`_\ ，專門處理這個問題。《小品》段落中寫道：「我允許你們，諸比丘，以五種方式中的任一種方式食用已經為沙門作淨的水果：如果它被火損壞、被刀子損壞、被指甲損壞、如果是無籽的、第五種是如果籽被排出。」《大品》段落寫道：「當時舍衛城有許多水果，但沒有人作淨……（佛陀說）『我允許吃沒有籽的水果，或者籽排出的水果，（即使）它沒有被作淨。』

   * - First, to summarize the commentaries’ discussion of seedless fruit and fruit whose seeds have been discharged: According to the Commentary to the Mahāvagga, *seedless fruit* includes fruit whose seeds are too immature to grow. As for fruit whose seeds have been discharged, the Sub-commentary states that this means, “Fruit, such as mangoes or jackfruit, which it is possible to eat having removed the seeds and separating them entirely (from the flesh).”

     - 首先，總結一下註釋書中對無籽水果和籽已排出的水果的討論：根據《大品》的《義註》，\ *無籽水果*\ 包括種子未成熟而無法生長的水果。至於種子已排出的水果，《複註》指出，這意味著「諸如芒果或菠蘿蜜之類的水果，可以去掉種子並將它們完全（與果肉）分離後再食用。」

   * - The question sometimes arises as to whether bhikkhus may remove the seeds themselves before eating fruit of this sort, or if an unordained person has to remove them first. Given the context of the Mahāvagga passage and the wording of the Sub-commentary’s explanation, it seems clear that the bhikkhus themselves may discharge the seeds before or while eating the fruit. As the Commentary notes, both these kinds of fruit are allowable in and of themselves, and need not go through any other procedure to make them allowable.

     - 有時會出現這樣的問題：比丘是否可以在吃這種水果之前自己去掉種子，或者是否必須由未受具足戒的人先去掉種子。考慮到《大品》段落的上下文和《複註》解釋的措辭，似乎很明顯比丘自己可以在吃水果之前或吃水果時排出種子。正如《義註》所指出的，這兩種水果本身都是允許的，不需要經過任何其他作淨程序。

   * - Other kinds of fruit, though, such as those with numerous seeds (such as tomatoes and blackberries) or whose seeds would be difficult to remove undamaged (such as grapes) must be damaged by fire, a knife, or a fingernail before a bhikkhu may eat them. The Commentary’s description of how to do this shows that the damaging need only be symbolic: An unordained person draws a hot object or a knife across the skin of the fruit, or pokes it with a fingernail, saying “allowable” *(kappiyaṁ)* either while doing the damaging or immediately afterward. The Sub-commentary notes that the word for “allowable” may be stated in any language.

     - 然而，其他種類的水果，例如帶有大量種子的水果（例如蕃茄和黑莓）或難以去除而不損害種子的水果（例如葡萄），必須用火、刀或指甲損害後，比丘才能食用。《義註》中對如何做到這一點的描述表明，損害只需要是象徵性的：一個未受具足戒的人用一個熱物體或一把刀劃過水果皮，或者用指甲戳它，在損害的同時或之後立即說「允許的」\ *（kappiyaṁ）*\ 。《複註》指出，「允許的」一詞可以用任何語言表達。

   * - If a heap of fruit, such as grapes, is brought to a bhikkhu, he should say, “Make it allowable,” *(Kappiyaṁ karohi,)* either to the donor or to any other unordained person who knows how. The unordained person need only make one of the grapes allowable in line with the above procedures for the entire heap to be considered allowable, although he/she should not remove the grape from the heap while doing so.

     - 如果一堆水果（例如葡萄）被帶給比丘，他應該對布施者或任何其他知道如何做的未受具足戒者說「使其被允許」\ *（Kappiyaṁ karohi）*\ 。未受具足戒者只需按照上述程序作淨其中一顆葡萄，整堆葡萄即可被視為已作淨，但他/她在如此做時不應將該葡萄從葡萄堆中取出。

   * - The Sub-commentary claims that the ceremony of making fruit allowable must always be performed in the presence of a bhikkhu, but the Commentary mentions this factor only in connection with this last case—making an entire heap of fruit allowable by “damaging” only one piece—and not in its basic description of how the procedure is done.

     - 《複註》聲稱，作淨水果的儀式必須始終在比丘面前進行，但《義註》僅在與最後一種情況相關時提到了這一因素——通過「損壞」一塊水果來作淨整堆水果——而不是在對如何進行該程序的基本描述中提到了這一點。

   * - In Communities that follow the Sub-commentary, the custom is as follows: When a donor brings grapes, tomatoes, or similar fruit to a bhikkhu, the bhikkhu says, “\ *Kappiyaṁ karohi* (Make it allowable).” The donor damages the fruit in any of the three specified ways and says, “\ *Kappiyaṁ bhante* (It is allowable, venerable sir),” while doing the damaging, and then presents the fruit to the bhikkhu.

     - 在遵循《複註》的僧團中，習俗如下：當施主帶給比丘葡萄、蕃茄或類似的水果時，比丘會說「\ *Kappiyaṁ karohi*\ （使其被允許）」。施主以三種指定方式中的一種損害水果，並在損害時說：「\ *Kappiyaṁ bhante*\ （這是允許的，尊者）」，然後將水果呈給比丘。

   * - In Communities that do not follow the Sub-commentary, the donor may perform the act of damaging the fruit beforehand. If the damage is obvious, a bhikkhu may accept and consume the fruit without asking. If it’s not, he should ask whether it has been damaged. If the reply is Yes, he may accept and consume it. If No, it should first be damaged in his presence.

     - 在不遵循《複註》的僧團中，施主可以事先進行損害水果的行為。如果損害很明顯，比丘可以接受並食用水果而無需詢問。如果不明顯，他應該詢問它是否已被損害。如果答案是肯定的，他可以接受並食用它。如果不是，則應先在他面前將其損害。

   * - Even in this second type of Community, however, the act of making a heap of fruit allowable by damaging only one piece *must* be done in a bhikkhu’s presence. And we should note again that seedless fruit or fruit whose seeds may be removed entirely from the flesh of the fruit are allowable in and of themselves, and do not have to go through any procedure before a bhikkhu may accept and eat them.

     - 然而，即使在第二種類型的僧團中，透過損害一塊水果來作淨一堆水果的行為\ *必須*\ 在比丘面前進行。我們應該再次注意，無籽水果或可以將種子從果肉中完全去除的水果本身是允許的，並且不需要經過任何程序，比丘就可以接受和食用它們。

   * - The two passages in the Mahāvagga and Cullavagga that we have been discussing deal specifically only with fruit, but the Commentary extrapolates from them to say that the same conditions apply to other forms of bījagāma, such as sugar cane and bean sprouts as well.

     - 我們一直在討論的《大品》和《小品》中的兩個段落僅僅專門討論了水果，但《義註》從中推斷，同樣的情況也適用於其他形式的 bījagāma，例如甘蔗和豆芽。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - The Vibhaṅga says that there is no offense for a bhikkhu who cuts a living plant—
     - 《經分別》說，比丘砍伐活的植物並無犯戒——

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          unknowingly—e.g., thinking it to be dead,

     - .. container:: mx-2

          不知道地──例如，以為它死了，

          unthinkingly—e.g., absent-mindedly pulling grass while talking with someone, or

     - .. container:: mx-2

          不假思索地——例如，在與人交談時心不在焉地拔草，或者

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          unintentionally—e.g., inadvertently uprooting grass while raking leaves, or grabbing onto a plant for support while climbing a hill and inadvertently uprooting it.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          無意地——例如，在耙樹葉時不小心把草連根拔起，或者在爬山時抓住植物支撐而無意中把它連根拔起。

   * - Also, there is no penalty in telling an unordained person to make an item allowable; in asking for leaves, flowers, etc., without specifically saying *which* leaves or flowers are to be picked; or in indicating indirectly that, e.g., the grass needs cutting (“Look at how long the grass is”) or that a tree needs pruning (“This branch is in the way”) without expressly giving the command to cut. In other words, this is another rule where one may avoid an offense by using *kappiya-vohāra:* “wording it right.”

     - 此外，告訴未受具足戒的人作淨某件物品不會受到懲罰；索要樹葉、花朵等，但沒有具體說明要採摘\ *哪些*\ 樹葉或花朵；或者間接地表明，例如，草需要修剪（「看看這草有多長」）或樹需要修剪（「這個樹枝擋道了」），而沒有明確發出修剪的命令。換句話說，這是另一條可以透過使用 *kappiya-vohāra*\（「正確措辭」）來避免違犯的戒條。

   * - `Cv.V.32.1`_ says that if a brush fire is approaching a dwelling, one may light a counter-fire to ward it off. In doing so, one is exempt from any penalty imposed by this rule.

     - `《小品》.五.32.1`_ 規定，如果灌木叢火災正在逼近住所，可以點燃逆火來撲滅。這樣做，免於本戒條所施加的任何懲罰。

   * - Also, according to the Sub-commentary to `NP 6`_, a bhikkhu whose robes have been snatched away and who cannot find any other cloth to cover himself may pick grass and leaves to cover himself without incurring a penalty here.

     - 此外，根據\ `《捨墮》六`_\ 的《複註》，如果比丘的袈裟被奪走，而他又找不到其他衣服遮蓋自己，那麼他可以採摘草葉來遮蓋自己，而不會受到懲罰。

   * - *Summary: Intentionally cutting, burning, or killing a living plant is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：故意砍伐、焚燒或殺死活的植物，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*
