          “A certain Āḷavī bhikkhu was chopping down a tree. The devatā living in the tree said to the bhikkhu, ‘Venerable sir, do not chop down my home to build a home for yourself.’ The bhikkhu, disregarding her, kept right on chopping and injured the arm of the devatā’s child. The devatā thought: ‘What if I were to kill this bhikkhu right here?’ Then another thought occurred to her: ‘But no, that wouldn’t be proper…. What if I were to tell the Blessed One of what has happened?’ So she went to the Blessed One and… told him of what had happened.

          「\ `有一位阿羅毘比丘正在砍樹 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0043a13>`_\ 。住在樹上的天女對比丘說：『大德，不要砍倒我的房子來為自己建造房子。』比丘不理會她，繼續砍樹，弄傷了天女孩子的手臂。天女想：『如果我就在這裡殺死這位比丘會怎麼樣？』然後她又想到：「但不，那樣不合適......如果我把所發生的事告訴世尊呢？』於是她去找世尊並......告訴他所發生的事。

          “‘Very good, devatā, very good. It’s very good that you didn’t kill the bhikkhu. If you had killed him today, you would have produced much demerit for yourself. Now go, devatā. Over there is a vacant tree. Go into it.’ (The Commentary adds here that the tree, being in Jeta’s Grove, was a definite move up for the devatā. She had a front-row seat for overhearing the Buddha’s teachings well into the night; unlike other lesser devas she wasn’t pushed out to the far reaches of the galaxy when large groups of major devas met with the Buddha; and when the Four Great Kings came to attend to the Buddha, they always made a point of visiting her before leaving. However:)

          「『很好，天女，很好。你沒有殺死比丘，這很好。如果你今天殺了他，你會為自己造下很多罪孽。現在去吧，天女。那邊有一棵空樹。進去吧。』（《義註》在這裡補充說，這棵樹位於祇陀林，對天女來說，這絕對是一個明確的進步。她有一個前排的座位，可以聽到佛陀的教誨，一直到夜晚；與其他較低天神不同，當大天神群與佛陀會面時，她並沒有被推到銀河系的遙遠地方；每當四大天王來侍奉佛陀時，他們離開之前總會去拜見她。無論如何：）

          “People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks cut down trees and have them cut down? They are mistreating one-facultied life.’”

          「人們批評、抱怨並四處散播，『這些沙門釋子怎麼能砍伐樹木並讓人砍伐？他們虐待一根之命。』」

   * - This is another offense with the four factors of object, effort, perception, and intention.
     - 此為另一個具有對象、努力、感知、意圖四個因素的犯戒。
