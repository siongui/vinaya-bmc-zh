   * - This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.

     - 根據《附隨》，這個術語源自於一個動詞，意思是「失去」或「被擊敗」。比丘若犯下列四條戒中的任何一種，就已經屈服於自己的心理煩惱，以致他違背了自己成為比丘的初衷。《經分別》中用許多比喻說明了這種擊敗的不可挽回的性質：「就像一個人的頭被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的葉子脫離了莖……就像一塊被碎成兩半的扁平石頭無法再拼湊起來……就像一棵被砍掉樹冠的\ `糖棕`_\ 無法進一步生長一樣。” 犯下任何這些戒的比丘不可挽回地從僧團生活中斷絕，並且不再被視為比丘。

          *Should any bhikkhu—participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus, without having renounced the training, without having declared his weakness—engage in sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeated and no longer in affiliation.*

          *如果任何比丘——參加比丘的訓練和生活，沒有放棄訓練，沒有表明自己的弱點——進行性交，即使是與雌性動物，也是波羅夷，不共住。*

   * - As we noted in the Introduction, the first formulation of this rule followed on Ven. Sudinna’s having had sex with one of his former wives. His motives, by worldly standards, were relatively noble: He was complying with his parents’ desire that he provide them with an heir. However, in the incident leading to the second formulation of this rule—in which the Buddha added the phrase “even with a female animal”—the instigator’s motives were considerably less so.

     - 正如我們在\ `引言`_\ 中指出的，這條戒條的最初制定是在須提那尊者與他的前妻們之一發生了性關係。按照世俗的標準，他的動機相對崇高：他遵守父母的願望，為他們提供一個繼承人。然而，在導致第二次制定這條戒條的事件中——佛陀在其中添加了「即使是與雌性動物」這句話——犯戒者的動機卻遠非如此。

          “Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu living in the Great Wood at Vesālī, having befriended a monkey with food (§), engaged in sexual intercourse with it. Then, dressing (§) early in the morning and carrying his bowl and outer robe, the bhikkhu went into Vesālī for alms. A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§). The thought occurred to the bhikkhus, ‘Undoubtedly this bhikkhu is engaging in sexual intercourse with this monkey.’ So they hid off to one side.

          “Then the bhikkhu, having gone for alms in Vesālī, returned bringing almsfood. The monkey went up to him. The bhikkhu, having eaten a portion of the almsfood, gave a portion to the monkey. The monkey, having eaten the almsfood, offered its rear to the bhikkhu, and the bhikkhu engaged in sexual intercourse with it (§).

          “Then the bhikkhus said to the bhikkhu, ‘Hasn’t a training rule been formulated by the Blessed One? How can you engage in sexual intercourse with this monkey?’

          “‘It’s true, friends, that a training rule has been formulated by the Blessed One, but that’s with regard to a human female, not to a female animal.’”

          「當時，有一位比丘住在毘舍離大林裡，以食物與一隻猴子結交（§），並與它交合。然後，比丘一大早穿好衣服，帶著鉢和外衣，到毘舍離去托缽。眾多比丘巡行房舍，來到了該比丘的住處。猴子遠遠地看見他們來了，一見他們，就走到他們面前，搖著臀部，搖著尾巴，把臀部拱了出來，做了個淫相（§）。比丘們心想：「毫無疑問，這位比丘正在與這隻猴子交合。」於是他們躲到一邊。

          「然後，比丘在毘舍離托缽之後，帶著托缽食物回來了。猴子向他走來。比丘吃完一部分缽食後，將一部分給予猴子。猴子吃完缽食後，將它的屁股示現給比丘，比丘就與它交合（§）。

          「然後，諸比丘對該比丘說：『世尊不是制定了學處嗎？你怎麼能和這隻猴子交合呢？

          “‘朋友們，確實有一條學處是由世尊制定的，但那是針對人類女性，而不是針對雌性動物。’”

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The term *sexual intercourse* refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (*passāva-magga*)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (*vacca-magga*); or the mouth (*mukha*). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using *magga* (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and *amagga* (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.

     - *性交*\ 一詞是指所有類型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（\ *passāva-magga*\ ），即女性的陰道或男性的陰莖）；肛門（\ *vacca-magga*\ ）；或嘴（\ *mukha*\ ）。《經分別》總結了這些孔穴的各種可能的組合，並得出結論：除了口對口的插入（在下面的衍生違犯中處理）之外，所有這些孔穴都滿足了這裡的努力因素。不幸的是，《經分別》的總結是用技術術語表達的，使用 *magga* （道）來表示生殖器或肛門，使用 *amagga* （非道）來表示嘴。《義註》在討論總結時，錯誤地將嘴也歸類為道，因此必須為「非道」發明一個不同的意義：與三道之一接壤的傷口。由於《義註》對這一點的討論是基於誤解，因此無需進一步追究。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.

     - 《經分別》指出，當在該戒條涵蓋的任何可能的組合中，一個器官進入另一個器官時，即使只是達到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表發生了性交。這意味著比丘進行性交、口交或肛交時，無論他扮演什麼角色，都隸屬於這條戒條。器官之間是否有覆蓋物（例如保險套）的問題不相干，比丘是主動參與還是被動參與，以及參與的任何一方是否達到性高潮的問題都是不相干的。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The full penalty under this rule applies to any voluntary sexual intercourse with a human being, a “non-human” being (a *yakkha*, *nāga*, or *peta*), or a common animal, whether female, male, neuter, or hermaphrodite.

     - 這條戒條下的全額懲罰適用於與人類、「非人類」（夜叉 *yakkha* 、龍 *nāga* 或鬼 *peta* ）或普通動物（無論是雌性、雄性、中性或雌雄同體）的任何自願性交。

   * - Performing sexual intercourse with a dead body—even a decapitated head—also entails the full penalty if the remains of the body are intact enough for the act to be accomplished.

     - 如果屍體的殘骸夠完整以完成性交，與屍體（即使是與被斬首的頭）進行性交也將受到全額懲罰。

   * - In addition, the Vinīta-vatthu lists two examples of “self-intercourse”: A bhikkhu with a supple back takes his penis into his mouth, and a bhikkhu with an unusually long penis inserts it into his anus. Both cases carry the full penalty.

     - 此外，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》還列舉了兩個「自我性交」的例子：一個背部柔軟的比丘將陰莖放入口中，一個陰莖異常長的比丘將其插入肛門。 兩種情況均需受到全額懲罰。

   :widths: auto

   * - **Knowledge & consent**
     - **知悉 & 同意**

   * - For sexual intercourse to count as an offense, the bhikkhu must know that it is happening and give his consent. Thus if he is sexually assaulted while asleep or otherwise unconscious and remains oblivious to what is happening, he incurs no penalty. If, however, he becomes conscious during the assault or was conscious right from the start, then whether he incurs a penalty depends on whether he gives his consent during any part of the act.

     - 將性交算做犯戒，比丘必須知道它正在發生並給予他的同意。因此，如果他在睡覺或失去知覺時遭到性侵犯，並且對發生的事情渾然不覺，他不會受到懲罰。然而，如果他在襲擊過程中變得清醒，或者從一開始就清醒了，那麼他是否受到懲罰取決於他在行為的任何部分是否表示同意。

   * - Strangely enough, neither the Canon nor the Commentary discusses the factor of consent in any detail, except to mention by way of passing that it can apply to the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out. From the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, it would appear that consent refers to a *mental* state of acquiescence, together with its physical or verbal expression. Mere physical compliance does not count, as there are cases where bhikkhus forced into intercourse comply physically but without consenting mentally and so are absolved of any offense. However, there is also a case in which a woman invites a bhikkhu to engage in sexual intercourse, saying that she will do all the work while he can avoid an offense by doing nothing. The bhikkhu does as she tells him to, but when the case comes to the Buddha’s attention, the Buddha imposes a pārājika on the act without even asking the bhikkhu whether he consented or not. The assumption is that complying with a request like this indicates consent, regardless of whether one makes any physical or verbal movement at all.

     - 奇怪的是，《聖典》和《義註》都沒有詳細討論同意因素，只是順便提到它可以適用於插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出的階段。從《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中的例子來看，同意看來是指一種默許的\ *心理*\ 狀態，連同其身體或言語表達。僅僅身體上的順從並不算數，因為在某些情況下，比丘被迫進行性交，但沒有心理上的同意，因此沒有犯任何戒。然而，也有一種情況，女人邀請比丘發生性行為，說她會做所有的工作，他什麼都不做就可以避免犯戒。比丘照她的吩咐去做，但當這件事引起佛陀的注意時，佛陀甚至沒有詢問比丘是否同意，就認定該行為犯《波羅夷》。前提是，遵守這樣的請求就表明同意，無論一個人是否做出任何身體或口頭動作。

   * - Taken together, these cases imply that if one is sexually assaulted, one is completely absolved from an offense only if (1) one does not give one’s mental consent at any time during the act or (2) one does feel mental consent during at least part of the act but puts up a struggle so as not to express that consent physically or verbally in any way. (As the Commentary notes, drawing a general principle from the Vinīta-vatthu to `Pr 2`_, mere mental consent without physical expression is not enough to count as a factor of an offense, for there is no offense simply in the arising of a thought or mental state.) If one puts up no struggle and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out, one incurs the full penalty. This would seem to be the basis for the Commentary’s warning in its discussion of the Vinīta-vatthu case in which a bhikkhu wakes up to find himself being sexually assaulted by a woman, gives her a kick, and sends her rolling. The warning: This is how a bhikkhu still subject to sensual lust should act if he wants to protect his state of mind.

     - 總而言之，這些案例意味著，如果一個人受到性侵犯，只有在以下情況下才可以完全免除犯戒：（1）一個人在行為過程中的任何時候都沒有心理上同意，或者（2）一個人至少在行為過程中的某部份確實感到心理上的同意，但奮力掙扎避免以任何方式透過身體或口頭表達同意。（如《義註》中所指出的，從\ `《波羅夷》二`_\ 的《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中得出一條一般原則，僅在心理上同意而沒有身體表達，不足以算作犯戒的一個因素，因為僅僅在想法或心理狀態中產生並不構成犯戒。）如果一個人沒有做出任何掙扎並感到精神上同意，即使只是在插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出階段短暫地發生，也會受到全額懲罰。這似乎是《義註》在討論《Vinīta_-vatthu_》的例子時發出警告的基礎，在該案例中，一名比丘醒來，發現自己遭到一名女人的性侵犯，踢了她一腳，然後讓她滾出去。警告：如果一個比丘仍然受制於色欲，他想要保護他的心境，就應該這樣做。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu with “impaired faculties”—one who feels neither pleasure nor pain during intercourse—engages in intercourse under the assumption that his impairment exempts him from the rule. The case is brought to the Buddha, who states, “Whether this worthless man did or didn’t feel [anything], it is a case involving defeat.” From this ruling it can be argued that a bhikkhu indulging in intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty even if he doesn’t feel pleasure in the course of the act.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中記載了一個案例，一位「官能受損」的比丘——在性交時既感覺不到快樂也感覺不到痛苦——認為他的缺陷使他不受戒條約束而進行性交。這個案例被提交給佛陀，佛陀說：“無論這個愚癡人有沒有（任何）感覺，這都是一個《波羅夷》的案例。” 從這個裁決可以看出，一個比丘在密宗儀式中沉溺於性交，即使他在行為過程中沒有感到快樂，也會受到全額懲罰。

   * - **Derived offenses**
     - **衍生違犯**

   * - Two thullaccaya offenses are directly related to this rule. The first is for mouth-to-mouth penetration— i.e., the act of inserting any part of one’s mouth into the mouth of another person, or consenting to the insertion of another person’s mouth in one’s own—regardless of whether the other person is a man, a woman, or a common animal. When this act occurs under the influence of lust, as in an intense kiss, the thullaccaya here would be incurred in addition to whatever penalty is assigned for lustful bodily contact under `Sg 2`_.

     - 兩種《偷蘭遮》罪與此戒條直接相關。第一種是口對口插入－即將一個人的嘴的任何部分插入另一個人的嘴裡，或同意另一個人的嘴插入自己的嘴裡的行為－無論對方是否是一個男人，女人，或普通的動物。當這種行為在性欲的影響下發生時，例如在激烈的接吻中，除了根據\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 對出於性欲的身體接觸所規定的懲罰之外，還會犯《偷蘭遮》。

   * - The second thullaccaya is for the unlikely case of a bhikkhu who attempts intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse. To attempt intercourse with any other part of a dead body or with any part of an insentient object, such as an inflatable doll or mannequin, incurs a dukkaṭa. (If this led to an ejaculation, however, the case would be treated under `Sg 1`_.)

     - 第二種《偷蘭遮》是針對一個不太可能發生的情況，即比丘試圖與屍體腐爛的嘴巴、肛門或生殖器性交。試著與屍體的任何其他部分或無知覺物體的任何部位（例如充氣娃娃或人體模型）進行性交，都會犯《突吉羅》。（但是，如果這導致射精，則該情況將根據\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 進行處理。）

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either `Sg 1`_ for intentional ejaculation or `Sg 2`_ for lustful bodily contact. As we shall see below, the penalties assigned in the latter case are as follows: if the partner is a woman, a saṅghādisesa; if a *paṇḍaka* (see `Sg 2`_), a thullaccaya; if a man or a common animal, a dukkaṭa. We can infer from the Vibhaṅga’s ruling here that if a bhikkhu has an orgasm while attempting intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse, with any other part of a dead body, or with any part of an insentient object, the case would come under `Sg 1`_.

     - 《經分別》指出，如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部位發生性交，這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條－若非\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 代表故意射精，則為\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 代表出於性欲的身體接觸。正如我們將在下面看到的，後一種情況的懲罰如下：如果對象是女人，《僧殘》；如果是\ `黃門`_ *paṇḍaka* （參見\ `《僧殘》二`_\ ），《偷蘭遮》；如果是男人或普通動物，《突吉羅》。在此我們可以從《經分別》的裁決中推斷出，如果一個比丘在嘗試與屍體腐爛的嘴、肛門或生殖器，或與屍體的任何其他部分，或與無知覺物體的任何部分性交時獲得性高潮，該情況屬於\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 。

   * - The Commentary disagrees with the Vibhaṅga on these points, however, saying that the derived offenses under this rule can include only dukkaṭa and thullaccaya penalties. In its explanation of `Sg 1`_, it sets forth a system of eleven types of lust in which the lust for the pleasure of bringing about an ejaculation, lust for the pleasure of bodily contact, and lust for the pleasure of intercourse are treated as completely separate things that must be treated under separate rules. Thus, it says, if a bhikkhu aiming at intercourse takes hold of a woman’s body, it is simply a preliminary to intercourse and thus entails only a dukkaṭa, rather than a saṅghādisesa for lustful bodily contact. Similarly, if he has a premature ejaculation before beginning intercourse, there is no offense at all.

     - 然而，《義註》在這些觀點上不同意《經分別》，稱此戒條衍生的違犯只能包括《突吉羅》和《偷蘭遮》懲罰。在對\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 的解釋中，它提出了十一種性欲的系統，其中對射精快感的性欲，對身體接觸快感的性欲，和對性交快感的性欲被視為完全不同的事情，必須根據不同的戒條處理。因此，它說，如果一個以性交為目的的比丘抓住了一個女人的身體，這只是性交的一個預備行動，因此只犯《突吉羅》，而不是出於性欲身體接觸的《僧殘》。同樣地，如果他在開始性交之前出現早洩，也沒有任何犯戒。

   * - These are fine academic distinctions and are clearly motivated by a desire to draw neat lines between the rules, but they lead to practical problems. As the Commentary itself points out, if a bhikkhu commits an act that falls near the borderline between these rules but cannot later report precisely which type of lust he was feeling in the heat of the moment, there is no way his case can be judged and a penalty assigned. At any rate, though, there is no basis in the Canon for the Commentary’s system, and in fact it contradicts not only the Vibhaṅga’s ruling mentioned above, but also its definition of *lustful* under `Sg 2`_, 3_, & 4_, which is exactly the same for all three rules and places no limits on the type of lust involved. All of this leads to the conclusion that the Commentary’s neat system for classifying lust is invalid, and that the Vibhaṅga’s judgment holds: If a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either `Sg 1`_ for intentional ejaculation or `Sg 2`_ for lustful bodily contact—rather than here.

     - 這些都是很好的學術區別，顯然是出於希望在戒條之間劃清界線的動機，但它們會導致實際問題。正如《義註》本身指出的那樣，如果比丘所犯下的行為接近這些戒條的邊緣，但後來無法準確地報告他在一時衝動中感受到哪種類型的欲望，那麼他的情況就無法判斷並給予懲罰。但，無論如何，《義註》的系統在《聖典》中是沒有任何依據的，事實上，它不僅與上述《經分別》的裁決相矛盾，而且也與在\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 、\ `三`_\ 、\ `四`_\ 中對\ *性欲*\ 的定義相矛盾，這個定義在所有三個戒條都是相同的，並且對所涉及的性欲類型沒有限制。這一切都得出這樣的結論：《義註》對性欲進行分類的簡潔工整系統是無效的，而《經分別》的判斷是成立的：如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部分進行交合，那麼這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條的範疇－若非\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 代表故意射精，則為\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 代表出於性欲的身體接觸－而不是這裡。

   * - **Blanket exemptions**
     - **總括性豁免**

   * - In addition to bhikkhus who do not know they are being assaulted or do not give their consent when they do know, the Vibhaṅga states that there are four special categories of bhikkhus exempted from a penalty under this rule: any bhikkhu who is insane, possessed by spirits, delirious with pain, or the first offender(s) (in this case, Ven. Sudinna and the bhikkhu with the monkey) whose actions prompted the Buddha to formulate the rule. The Commentary defines as *insane* anyone who “goes about in an unseemly way, with deranged perceptions, having cast away all sense of shame and compunction, not knowing whether he has transgressed major or minor training rules.” It recognizes this as a medical condition, which it blames on the bile. A bhikkhu under the influence of a severe psychosis-inducing drug would apparently fall under this exemption, but one under the influence of a more common intoxicant would not. As for spirit possession, the Commentary says that this can happen either when spirits frighten one or when, by distracting one with sensory images, they insert their hands into one’s heart by way of one’s mouth (!). Whatever the cause, it notes that insane and possessed bhikkhus are exempt from penalties they incur only when their perceptions are deranged (“when their mindfulness is entirely forgotten and they don’t know what fire, gold, excrement, and sandalwood are”) and not from any they incur during their lucid moments. As for a bhikkhu delirious with pain, he is exempt from penalties he incurs only during periods when the pain is so great that he does not know what he is doing.

     - 除了不知道自己受到侵犯或明知後不同意的比丘外，《經分別》指出，有四種特殊類別的比丘可免受此戒條的處罰：任何精神錯亂的比丘、被附身、或因痛苦而發狂神智不清，或最初犯戒者（在本例中，是須提那尊者和與猴子在一起的比丘），他們的行為促使佛陀制定了戒條。《義註》將\ *精神錯亂*\ 定義為「行為不得體，知覺錯亂，已拋棄所有慚愧感，不知犯大、小學處」的人。它認為這是一種健康狀況，並將其歸咎於膽汁。受到嚴重的誘發精神病藥物影響的比丘顯然屬於這裡的豁免範圍，但受到更常見的麻醉劑影響的比丘則不然。至於附身，《義註》說，這種情況可能發生在靈體嚇唬人的時候，或者當靈體通過感官圖像分散人的注意力，通過人的嘴將手插入人的心臟時（！）。無論出於什麼原因，它指出，精神錯亂和被附身的比丘只有在他們的知覺錯亂時（“當他們的正念完全被遺忘，並且他們不知道火，金，糞便和檀香是什麼時”）才可以免受懲罰，在清醒時所發生則不能豁免。至於因痛苦而發狂神智不清的比丘，只有當疼痛劇烈到他不知道自己在做什麼時，他才可以免於懲罰。

   * - These four categories are exempted from penalties under nearly all of the rules, although the first offender for each rule is exempted only for the one time he acted in such a way as to provoke the Buddha into formulating the rule. I will only rarely mention these categories again, and—except where expressly stated otherwise—the reader should bear them in mind as exempt in every case.

     - 這四類別幾乎在所有戒條中都可以免於處罰，儘管每條戒條的初犯只有一次，其行為引起佛陀制定該戒條時才可以得到豁免。我很少會再次提及這些類別，除非另有明確說明，否則讀者應該牢記它們在任何情況下都可以豁免。

          “At that time a certain bhikkhu had gone to the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood at Vesālī to pass the day and was sleeping, having left the door open. His various limbs were stiff with the ‘wind forces’ (i.e., he had an erection) (§). Now at that time a large company of women bearing garlands and scents came to the park, headed for the dwelling. Seeing the bhikkhu, they sat down on his male organ (§) and, having taken their pleasure and remarking, ‘What a bull of a man, this one!’ they picked up their garlands and scents, and left.”

     - .. container:: notification

          「當時，有一位比丘到毘舍離大林的重閣講堂去打發一天，正在睡覺，門開著。他的各個肢體因「風力」而變得僵硬（即他勃起）（§）。那時，一大群帶著花環和香水的婦女來到公園，朝著住所走去。看到比丘後，他們坐在他的男性器官上（§），取得愉悅後說道：「這個人真是個公牛！」他們拿起花環和香水就離開了。

   * - The bhikkhu incurred no penalty, but the Buddha gave formal permission to close the door when resting during the day. From this permission, the Commentary formulates a prohibition—that a bhikkhu incurs a dukkaṭa if he does not close the door when sleeping during the day—but if the Buddha had intended a prohibition, he surely would have stated the rule in that form himself. In other words, one may sleep during the day without being penalized for whether the door is open or not.

     - 比丘沒有受到懲罰，但佛陀正式允許白天休息時關門。根據這項許可，《義註》制定了一條禁令——比丘如果白天睡覺時不關門，就會犯《突吉羅》——但如果佛陀有意禁止，他肯定會親自以禁令形式陳述這條戒條。換句話說，比丘可以在白天睡覺，而不會因為門是否打開而受到懲罰。

   * - *Summary: Voluntary sexual intercourse—genital, anal, or oral—with a human being, non-human being, or common animal is a pārājika offense.*
     - *摘要：與人類、非人或普通動物自願發生性交（生殖器、肛門或口腔）是《波羅夷》罪。*

          *Should any bhikkhu, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness—just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief”—a bhikkhu in the same way taking what is not given also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘，在村落或林野，拿取未給予的東西，被視為盜竊，就像國王逮捕罪犯，拿取未給予的東西時會鞭打、監禁或驅逐他一樣說：「你是強盜，你是愚人，你是愚昧無知的，你是小偷。」——比丘以同樣的方式拿取未給予的東西，也是波羅夷，不共住。*

   * - This rule against stealing is, in the working out of its details, the most complex in the Pāṭimokkha and requires the most explanation—not because stealing is a concept especially hard to understand, but because it can take so many forms. The Canon treats the issue in a case-by-case fashion that resists easy summary. To further complicate matters, the Commentary’s discussion of this rule is extremely prolix and deviates frequently from the Canon’s in both major and minor ways. Because the deviations are so numerous, we will focus solely on the major ones.

     - 就其細節而言，這條禁止偷竊的戒條是《波羅提木叉》中最複雜的，也需要最多的解釋——不是因為偷竊是一個特別難以理解的概念，而是因為它可以有多種形式。《聖典》以逐案的的方式對待這個議題，拒絕簡單地總結。使事情變得更加複雜的是，《義註》對這條戒條的討論極其冗長，並且經常在主要和次要方面偏離《聖典》的內容。由於偏差如此之多，我們將只關注主要的偏差。

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines the act of stealing in terms of four factors.
     - 《經分別》根據四個因素定義了偷竊行為。

   * - 1) *Object*: anything belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.
     - 1) *對象*\ ：屬於另一個人或一群人的任何東西。

   * - 2) *Perception*: One perceives the object as belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.
     - 2) *感知*\ ：察覺到該對象屬於另一個人或一群人。

   * - 3) *Intention*: One decides to steal it.
     - 3) *意圖*\ ：決定偷竊它。

   * - 4) *Effort*: One takes it.
     - 4) *努力*\ ：拿走它。

   * - Stealing under any circumstances is always an offense. However, the severity of the offense depends on another factor, which is—
     - 在任何情況下偷竊都是犯戒行為。然而，犯戒的嚴重程度取決於另一個因素，即——

   * - 5) The value of the object.
     - 5) 該對象的價值。


.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - For an object to qualify as *what is not given*\ —the rule’s term for anything that may be the object of a theft—it must belong to someone else: “not given, not forfeited, not abandoned/discarded; guarded, protected, claimed (§—literally, ‘viewed as “mine”’), possessed by someone else.” In all of the Vibhaṅga’s cases under this rule, that “someone else” is either an individual human being or a group of human beings. The question of property belonging to the Saṅgha logically fits here, but because the topic is fairly complex we will discuss it as a special case below.

     - 一個對象要符合“\ *未給予*\ ”的條件（該戒條對可能成為盜竊對象的任何物品的術語），它必須屬於其他人：“未給予、未沒收喪失、未遺棄/丟棄；” 被看守、保護、聲稱（§—字面意思是“被視為‘我的’）、被其他人擁有。” 在這條戒條下的所有《經分別》案例中，「其他人」若非一個人，則為一群人。僧團財產的疑問在邏輯上適用於這裡，但由於這個主題相當複雜，我們將在下面作為一個特例來討論。

   * - Because items that have been given away or discarded do not fulfill the factor of object here, there is no offense for a bhikkhu who takes a discarded object—such as rags from a pile of refuse—or unclaimed items from a wilderness. The Commentary, in some of its examples, includes items given up for lost under “abandoned,” but this interpretation has to be heavily qualified. If the owner retains a sense of ownership for the lost item, it would fall under the term *claimed*, and thus would still count as not given. Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned.

     - 因為被送出或丟棄的物品不符合這裡的對象因素，所以對於比丘來說，拿走被丟棄的物品——例如一堆垃圾中的破布——或來自林野中無主的物品，並沒有犯戒。《義註》中的一些例子中，「遺棄」包括了因遺失而放棄的物品，但這種解釋必須經過嚴格限定。如果失主保留對遺失物品的所有權意識，則該物品將屬於\ *有主的*\ ，因此仍然算作未給予。只有擁有者放棄所有的所有權意識，才算真正的遺棄。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu mentions an interesting case in which the groundskeeper in an orchard permits bhikkhus to take fruit from the orchard, even though he was not authorized to do so. The bhikkhus committed no offense.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》提到了一個有趣的案例，果園的園丁允許比丘們從果園拿水果，儘管他沒有被授權這樣做。比丘們沒有犯任何戒。

   * - The Commentary adds that if people are guarding an object as the property of a location—for example, an offering to a Buddha image, cetiya, or other sacred place—the object would also qualify as “not given” under this rule. Although the Vibhaṅga mentions property of this sort under `NP 30`_ and `Pc 82`_, for some reason it doesn’t mention it here. Nevertheless, the Commentary’s judgment on this point reflects a custom that had become widespread by its time, that of giving valuable items to a cetiya (this includes Buddha images) and dedicating them not to the Saṅgha but to the cetiya. Some medieval Indian Buddhist inscriptions express the idea that the cetiya or the Buddha relics (if any) within the cetiya actually own such objects, but the Commentary states that these objects have an owner simply in the sense that human beings are watching over them for the purpose of the cetiya. The jewels decorating the reliquary of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy or the offerings to the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok, for example, would fall under this category. According to the Commentary, the Saṅgha is duty-bound to care for such items but has no rights of ownership over them. In its discussion both of this rule and of Pv.XIX, it states that items given to the Saṅgha may be used for the purpose of the cetiya—for example, to contribute to its decoration or upkeep—but items given to the cetiya may not be used for the purpose of the Saṅgha.

     - 《義註》補充說，如果人們將某個物品作為某個地點的財產來保護——例如，供奉給佛像、\ `支提`_\ 或其他神聖場所的供品——根據這條戒條，該物品也將被視為“未給予”。儘管《經分別》在\ `《捨墮》三十`_\ 和\ `《波逸提》八二`_\ 中提到了此類財產，但由於某種原因，它在這裡沒有提及。然而，《義註》對這一點的判斷反映了當時流行的一種習俗，即向\ `支提`_\ （包括佛像）贈送貴重物品，將它們奉獻給\ `支提`_\ ，而不是僧團。一些中世紀印度佛教銘文表達了這樣的想法，即\ `支提`_\ 或\ `支提`_\ 內的佛舍利（如果有的話）實際上擁有這些物品，但《義註》指出，這些物品有主人，只因有人為了\ `支提`_\ 的緣故正在看守它們。例如，在\ `康提`_\ 裝飾\ `佛牙`_\ 箱的珠寶或曼谷供奉\ `玉佛`_\ 的供品就屬於這一類。根據《義註》，僧團有義務保管這些物品，但沒有所有權。在對該戒條和\ `《附隨》`_\ 一九的討論中，它指出給予僧伽的物品可以用於\ `支提`_\ —例如，有助於其裝飾或維護—但給予\ `支提`_\ 的物品不可作為僧伽之用。

   * - From the Commentary’s discussion of this type of ownership, it would appear that if there are no longer any human beings watching over a cetiya, the items donated to it would no longer count as having an owner and thus could be removed for safekeeping, preferably to another cetiya. Any bhikkhu who took such items for himself, however, would be risking the wrath of the devas who might be guarding the cetiya. This is why it is traditional in such cases to conduct a ceremony formally requesting the permission of any guardian devas, at the same time promising not to take such items for one’s own use.

     - 從《義註》對這種類型所有權的討論來看，如果不再有任何人看管\ `支提`_\ ，捐贈給它的物品將不再被視為有主物，因此可以被移走以妥善保管，最好是移到另一個\ `支提`_\ 。然而，任何比丘若將這些物品據為己有，就會冒著觸怒可能守護\ `支提`_\ 的天神的風險。這就是為什麼在這種情況下，傳統上會舉行儀式，正式請求任何守護天神的許可，同時承諾不會將這些物品據為己用。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that items belonging to common animals or petas are not covered by this rule. On this point, see the discussion under Non-offenses, below.

     - 《經分別》說，屬於一般動物或鬼的物品不屬於此戒條的範圍。關於這一點，請參閱下面「不犯」部分的討論。

   * - **Perception**
     - **感知**

   * - For the act of taking what is not given to count as theft, one must also perceive the object as not given. Thus there is no offense if one takes an object, even if it is not given, if one sincerely believes that it is ownerless or thrown away. Similarly, if a bhikkhu takes an object mistaking it for his own or as belonging to a friend who has given him permission to take his things on trust, there is no offense even if the assumption about the trust proves to be a misperception. Also, a bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, on the assumption that he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false.

     - 將未給予而拿取算做盜竊的行為，該人必須察覺該物品是未給予的。因此，如果一個人真誠地相信它是無主的或被丟棄的，那麼即使它是未給予的，如果該人拿走了它，也沒有犯戒。同樣地，如果比丘拿走一件物品，誤認為它是他自己的，或者是屬於一位允許他以信託方式拿走他的東西的朋友的，即使有關信託的假設被證明是一種誤解，也沒有犯戒。此外，比丘假設他有權利自助，從僧團的公共儲藏中拿東西，即使這個假設被證明是錯的，也沒有犯戒。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu, spotting some objects during the day, returns to steal them at night. However, instead of taking the objects he spotted, he ends up taking some possessions of his own. He earns a dukkaṭa for his efforts.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中有一個案例，一位比丘在白天發現一些物品，然後在晚上回來偷它們。然而，他最終沒有拿走他發現的物品，而是拿走了自己的一些所有物。他透過自己的努力犯了《突吉羅》。

   * - None of the texts discuss the possible case in which one might be in doubt as to whether the object in question is not given, perhaps because the compilers felt that the factor of intention, discussed next, would not apply in such cases. Thus it would not be an offense under this rule. However, the wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan, as explained below.

     - 沒有任何文本討論懷疑該物品是否尚未給予的這種可能情況，也許是因為編譯者認為接下來討論的意圖因素不適用於這種情況。因此，根據該戒條，這不會構成犯戒。然而，當一個人對某件物品的所有權有疑問時，明智之舉是不要將其據為己有，或最多借用它，如下所述。


.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The act of taking what is not given, even when one perceives it as not given, counts as theft only if one’s intention is to steal it. Thus, as the non-offense clauses say, a bhikkhu incurs no offense if he takes an object temporarily or on trust. On these points, see the discussion under Non-offenses, below. Also, the Vinīta-vatthu rules that a bhikkhu who, seeing an article left in a place where it might be damaged, puts it in safe keeping for the owner, commits no offense.

     - 拿取未給予之物的行為，即使察覺到它尚未給予，只有當一個人的意圖是偷竊它時，才算是偷竊。因此，正如不犯條款所說，比丘如果暫時或受託取用某物，並不會犯戒。關於這點，請參閱下面「不犯」部分的討論。此外，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》規定，比丘看到一件物品被留在可能會被損壞的地方，為該物主妥善保管，這並不構成犯戒。
