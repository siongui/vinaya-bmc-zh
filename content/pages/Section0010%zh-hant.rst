   * - This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.

     - 根據《附隨》，這個術語源自於一個動詞，意思是「失去」或「被擊敗」。比丘若犯下列四條戒中的任何一種，就已經屈服於自己的心理煩惱，以致他違背了自己成為比丘的初衷。《經分別》中用許多比喻說明了這種擊敗的不可挽回的性質：「就像一個人的頭被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的葉子脫離了莖……就像一塊被碎成兩半的扁平石頭無法再拼湊起來……就像一棵被砍掉樹冠的\ `糖棕`_\ 無法進一步生長一樣。” 犯下任何這些戒的比丘不可挽回地從僧團生活中斷絕，並且不再被視為比丘。

          *Should any bhikkhu—participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus, without having renounced the training, without having declared his weakness—engage in sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeated and no longer in affiliation.*

          *如果任何比丘——參加比丘的訓練和生活，沒有放棄訓練，沒有表明自己的弱點——進行性交，即使是與雌性動物，也是波羅夷，不共住。*

   * - As we noted in the Introduction, the first formulation of this rule followed on Ven. Sudinna’s having had sex with one of his former wives. His motives, by worldly standards, were relatively noble: He was complying with his parents’ desire that he provide them with an heir. However, in the incident leading to the second formulation of this rule—in which the Buddha added the phrase “even with a female animal”—the instigator’s motives were considerably less so.

     - 正如我們在\ `引言`_\ 中指出的，這條戒條的最初制定是在須提那尊者與他的前妻們之一發生了性關係。按照世俗的標準，他的動機相對崇高：他遵守父母的願望，為他們提供一個繼承人。然而，在導致第二次制定這條戒條的事件中——佛陀在其中添加了「即使是與雌性動物」這句話——犯戒者的動機卻遠非如此。

          “Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu living in the Great Wood at Vesālī, having befriended a monkey with food (§), engaged in sexual intercourse with it. Then, dressing (§) early in the morning and carrying his bowl and outer robe, the bhikkhu went into Vesālī for alms. A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§). The thought occurred to the bhikkhus, ‘Undoubtedly this bhikkhu is engaging in sexual intercourse with this monkey.’ So they hid off to one side.

          “Then the bhikkhu, having gone for alms in Vesālī, returned bringing almsfood. The monkey went up to him. The bhikkhu, having eaten a portion of the almsfood, gave a portion to the monkey. The monkey, having eaten the almsfood, offered its rear to the bhikkhu, and the bhikkhu engaged in sexual intercourse with it (§).

          “Then the bhikkhus said to the bhikkhu, ‘Hasn’t a training rule been formulated by the Blessed One? How can you engage in sexual intercourse with this monkey?’

          “‘It’s true, friends, that a training rule has been formulated by the Blessed One, but that’s with regard to a human female, not to a female animal.’”

          「當時，有一位比丘住在毘舍離大林裡，以食物與一隻猴子結交（§），並與它交合。然後，比丘一大早穿好衣服，帶著鉢和外衣，到毘舍離去托缽。眾多比丘巡行房舍，來到了該比丘的住處。猴子遠遠地看見他們來了，一見他們，就走到他們面前，搖著臀部，搖著尾巴，把臀部拱了出來，做了個淫相（§）。比丘們心想：「毫無疑問，這位比丘正在與這隻猴子交合。」於是他們躲到一邊。

          「然後，比丘在毘舍離托缽之後，帶著托缽食物回來了。猴子向他走來。比丘吃完一部分缽食後，將一部分給予猴子。猴子吃完缽食後，將它的屁股示現給比丘，比丘就與它交合（§）。

          「然後，諸比丘對該比丘說：『世尊不是制定了學處嗎？你怎麼能和這隻猴子交合呢？

          “‘朋友們，確實有一條學處是由世尊制定的，但那是針對人類女性，而不是針對雌性動物。’”

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The term *sexual intercourse* refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (*passāva-magga*)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (*vacca-magga*); or the mouth (*mukha*). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using *magga* (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and *amagga* (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.

     - *性交*\ 一詞是指所有類型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（\ *passāva-magga*\ ），即女性的陰道或男性的陰莖）；肛門（\ *vacca-magga*\ ）；或嘴（\ *mukha*\ ）。《經分別》總結了這些孔穴的各種可能的組合，並得出結論：除了口對口的插入（在下面的衍生違犯中處理）之外，所有這些孔穴都滿足了這裡的努力因素。不幸的是，《經分別》的總結是用技術術語表達的，使用 *magga* （道）來表示生殖器或肛門，使用 *amagga* （非道）來表示嘴。《義註》在討論總結時，錯誤地將嘴也歸類為道，因此必須為「非道」發明一個不同的意義：與三道之一接壤的傷口。由於《義註》對這一點的討論是基於誤解，因此無需進一步追究。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.

     - 《經分別》指出，當在該戒條涵蓋的任何可能的組合中，一個器官進入另一個器官時，即使只是達到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表發生了性交。這意味著比丘進行性交、口交或肛交時，無論他扮演什麼角色，都隸屬於這條戒條。器官之間是否有覆蓋物（例如保險套）的問題不相干，比丘是主動參與還是被動參與，以及參與的任何一方是否達到性高潮的問題都是不相干的。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The full penalty under this rule applies to any voluntary sexual intercourse with a human being, a “non-human” being (a *yakkha*, *nāga*, or *peta*), or a common animal, whether female, male, neuter, or hermaphrodite.

     - 這條戒條下的全額懲罰適用於與人類、「非人類」（夜叉 *yakkha* 、龍 *nāga* 或鬼 *peta* ）或普通動物（無論是雌性、雄性、中性或雌雄同體）的任何自願性交。

   * - Performing sexual intercourse with a dead body—even a decapitated head—also entails the full penalty if the remains of the body are intact enough for the act to be accomplished.

     - 如果屍體的殘骸夠完整以完成性交，與屍體（即使是與被斬首的頭）進行性交也將受到全額懲罰。

   * - In addition, the Vinīta-vatthu lists two examples of “self-intercourse”: A bhikkhu with a supple back takes his penis into his mouth, and a bhikkhu with an unusually long penis inserts it into his anus. Both cases carry the full penalty.

     - 此外，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》還列舉了兩個「自我性交」的例子：一個背部柔軟的比丘將陰莖放入口中，一個陰莖異常長的比丘將其插入肛門。 兩種情況均需受到全額懲罰。

   :widths: auto

   * - **Knowledge & consent**
     - **知悉 & 同意**

   * - For sexual intercourse to count as an offense, the bhikkhu must know that it is happening and give his consent. Thus if he is sexually assaulted while asleep or otherwise unconscious and remains oblivious to what is happening, he incurs no penalty. If, however, he becomes conscious during the assault or was conscious right from the start, then whether he incurs a penalty depends on whether he gives his consent during any part of the act.

     - 將性交算做犯戒，比丘必須知道它正在發生並給予他的同意。因此，如果他在睡覺或失去知覺時遭到性侵犯，並且對發生的事情渾然不覺，他不會受到懲罰。然而，如果他在襲擊過程中變得清醒，或者從一開始就清醒了，那麼他是否受到懲罰取決於他在行為的任何部分是否表示同意。

   * - Strangely enough, neither the Canon nor the Commentary discusses the factor of consent in any detail, except to mention by way of passing that it can apply to the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out. From the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, it would appear that consent refers to a *mental* state of acquiescence, together with its physical or verbal expression. Mere physical compliance does not count, as there are cases where bhikkhus forced into intercourse comply physically but without consenting mentally and so are absolved of any offense. However, there is also a case in which a woman invites a bhikkhu to engage in sexual intercourse, saying that she will do all the work while he can avoid an offense by doing nothing. The bhikkhu does as she tells him to, but when the case comes to the Buddha’s attention, the Buddha imposes a pārājika on the act without even asking the bhikkhu whether he consented or not. The assumption is that complying with a request like this indicates consent, regardless of whether one makes any physical or verbal movement at all.

     - 奇怪的是，《聖典》和《義註》都沒有詳細討論同意因素，只是順便提到它可以適用於插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出的階段。從《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中的例子來看，同意看來是指一種默許的\ *心理*\ 狀態，連同其身體或言語表達。僅僅身體上的順從並不算數，因為在某些情況下，比丘被迫進行性交，但沒有心理上的同意，因此沒有犯任何戒。然而，也有一種情況，女人邀請比丘發生性行為，說她會做所有的工作，他什麼都不做就可以避免犯戒。比丘照她的吩咐去做，但當這件事引起佛陀的注意時，佛陀甚至沒有詢問比丘是否同意，就認定該行為犯《波羅夷》。前提是，遵守這樣的請求就表明同意，無論一個人是否做出任何身體或口頭動作。

   * - Taken together, these cases imply that if one is sexually assaulted, one is completely absolved from an offense only if (1) one does not give one’s mental consent at any time during the act or (2) one does feel mental consent during at least part of the act but puts up a struggle so as not to express that consent physically or verbally in any way. (As the Commentary notes, drawing a general principle from the Vinīta-vatthu to `Pr 2`_, mere mental consent without physical expression is not enough to count as a factor of an offense, for there is no offense simply in the arising of a thought or mental state.) If one puts up no struggle and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out, one incurs the full penalty. This would seem to be the basis for the Commentary’s warning in its discussion of the Vinīta-vatthu case in which a bhikkhu wakes up to find himself being sexually assaulted by a woman, gives her a kick, and sends her rolling. The warning: This is how a bhikkhu still subject to sensual lust should act if he wants to protect his state of mind.

     - 總而言之，這些案例意味著，如果一個人受到性侵犯，只有在以下情況下才可以完全免除犯戒：（1）一個人在行為過程中的任何時候都沒有心理上同意，或者（2）一個人至少在行為過程中的某部份確實感到心理上的同意，但奮力掙扎避免以任何方式透過身體或口頭表達同意。（如《義註》中所指出的，從\ `《波羅夷》二`_\ 的《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中得出一條一般原則，僅在心理上同意而沒有身體表達，不足以算作犯戒的一個因素，因為僅僅在想法或心理狀態中產生並不構成犯戒。）如果一個人沒有做出任何掙扎並感到精神上同意，即使只是在插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出階段短暫地發生，也會受到全額懲罰。這似乎是《義註》在討論《Vinīta_-vatthu_》的例子時發出警告的基礎，在該案例中，一名比丘醒來，發現自己遭到一名女人的性侵犯，踢了她一腳，然後讓她滾出去。警告：如果一個比丘仍然受制於色欲，他想要保護他的心境，就應該這樣做。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu with “impaired faculties”—one who feels neither pleasure nor pain during intercourse—engages in intercourse under the assumption that his impairment exempts him from the rule. The case is brought to the Buddha, who states, “Whether this worthless man did or didn’t feel [anything], it is a case involving defeat.” From this ruling it can be argued that a bhikkhu indulging in intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty even if he doesn’t feel pleasure in the course of the act.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中記載了一個案例，一位「官能受損」的比丘——在性交時既感覺不到快樂也感覺不到痛苦——認為他的缺陷使他不受戒條約束而進行性交。這個案例被提交給佛陀，佛陀說：“無論這個愚癡人有沒有（任何）感覺，這都是一個《波羅夷》的案例。” 從這個裁決可以看出，一個比丘在密宗儀式中沉溺於性交，即使他在行為過程中沒有感到快樂，也會受到全額懲罰。

   * - **Derived offenses**
     - **衍生違犯**

   * - Two thullaccaya offenses are directly related to this rule. The first is for mouth-to-mouth penetration— i.e., the act of inserting any part of one’s mouth into the mouth of another person, or consenting to the insertion of another person’s mouth in one’s own—regardless of whether the other person is a man, a woman, or a common animal. When this act occurs under the influence of lust, as in an intense kiss, the thullaccaya here would be incurred in addition to whatever penalty is assigned for lustful bodily contact under `Sg 2`_.

     - 兩種《偷蘭遮》罪與此戒條直接相關。第一種是口對口插入－即將一個人的嘴的任何部分插入另一個人的嘴裡，或同意另一個人的嘴插入自己的嘴裡的行為－無論對方是否是一個男人，女人，或普通的動物。當這種行為在性欲的影響下發生時，例如在激烈的接吻中，除了根據\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 對出於性欲的身體接觸所規定的懲罰之外，還會犯《偷蘭遮》。

   * - The second thullaccaya is for the unlikely case of a bhikkhu who attempts intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse. To attempt intercourse with any other part of a dead body or with any part of an insentient object, such as an inflatable doll or mannequin, incurs a dukkaṭa. (If this led to an ejaculation, however, the case would be treated under `Sg 1`_.)

     - 第二種《偷蘭遮》是針對一個不太可能發生的情況，即比丘試圖與屍體腐爛的嘴巴、肛門或生殖器性交。試著與屍體的任何其他部分或無知覺物體的任何部位（例如充氣娃娃或人體模型）進行性交，都會犯《突吉羅》。（但是，如果這導致射精，則該情況將根據\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 進行處理。）

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either `Sg 1`_ for intentional ejaculation or `Sg 2`_ for lustful bodily contact. As we shall see below, the penalties assigned in the latter case are as follows: if the partner is a woman, a saṅghādisesa; if a *paṇḍaka* (see `Sg 2`_), a thullaccaya; if a man or a common animal, a dukkaṭa. We can infer from the Vibhaṅga’s ruling here that if a bhikkhu has an orgasm while attempting intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse, with any other part of a dead body, or with any part of an insentient object, the case would come under `Sg 1`_.

     - 《經分別》指出，如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部位發生性交，這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條－若非\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 代表故意射精，則為\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 代表出於性欲的身體接觸。正如我們將在下面看到的，後一種情況的懲罰如下：如果對象是女人，《僧殘》；如果是\ `黃門`_ *paṇḍaka* （參見\ `《僧殘》二`_\ ），《偷蘭遮》；如果是男人或普通動物，《突吉羅》。在此我們可以從《經分別》的裁決中推斷出，如果一個比丘在嘗試與屍體腐爛的嘴、肛門或生殖器，或與屍體的任何其他部分，或與無知覺物體的任何部分性交時獲得性高潮，該情況屬於\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 。

   * - The Commentary disagrees with the Vibhaṅga on these points, however, saying that the derived offenses under this rule can include only dukkaṭa and thullaccaya penalties. In its explanation of `Sg 1`_, it sets forth a system of eleven types of lust in which the lust for the pleasure of bringing about an ejaculation, lust for the pleasure of bodily contact, and lust for the pleasure of intercourse are treated as completely separate things that must be treated under separate rules. Thus, it says, if a bhikkhu aiming at intercourse takes hold of a woman’s body, it is simply a preliminary to intercourse and thus entails only a dukkaṭa, rather than a saṅghādisesa for lustful bodily contact. Similarly, if he has a premature ejaculation before beginning intercourse, there is no offense at all.

     - 然而，《義註》在這些觀點上不同意《經分別》，稱此戒條衍生的違犯只能包括《突吉羅》和《偷蘭遮》懲罰。在對\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 的解釋中，它提出了十一種性欲的系統，其中對射精快感的性欲，對身體接觸快感的性欲，和對性交快感的性欲被視為完全不同的事情，必須根據不同的戒條處理。因此，它說，如果一個以性交為目的的比丘抓住了一個女人的身體，這只是性交的一個預備行動，因此只犯《突吉羅》，而不是出於性欲身體接觸的《僧殘》。同樣地，如果他在開始性交之前出現早洩，也沒有任何犯戒。

   * - These are fine academic distinctions and are clearly motivated by a desire to draw neat lines between the rules, but they lead to practical problems. As the Commentary itself points out, if a bhikkhu commits an act that falls near the borderline between these rules but cannot later report precisely which type of lust he was feeling in the heat of the moment, there is no way his case can be judged and a penalty assigned. At any rate, though, there is no basis in the Canon for the Commentary’s system, and in fact it contradicts not only the Vibhaṅga’s ruling mentioned above, but also its definition of *lustful* under `Sg 2`_, 3_, & 4_, which is exactly the same for all three rules and places no limits on the type of lust involved. All of this leads to the conclusion that the Commentary’s neat system for classifying lust is invalid, and that the Vibhaṅga’s judgment holds: If a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either `Sg 1`_ for intentional ejaculation or `Sg 2`_ for lustful bodily contact—rather than here.

     - 這些都是很好的學術區別，顯然是出於希望在戒條之間劃清界線的動機，但它們會導致實際問題。正如《義註》本身指出的那樣，如果比丘所犯下的行為接近這些戒條的邊緣，但後來無法準確地報告他在一時衝動中感受到哪種類型的欲望，那麼他的情況就無法判斷並給予懲罰。但，無論如何，《義註》的系統在《聖典》中是沒有任何依據的，事實上，它不僅與上述《經分別》的裁決相矛盾，而且也與在\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 、\ `三`_\ 、\ `四`_\ 中對\ *性欲*\ 的定義相矛盾，這個定義在所有三個戒條都是相同的，並且對所涉及的性欲類型沒有限制。這一切都得出這樣的結論：《義註》對性欲進行分類的簡潔工整系統是無效的，而《經分別》的判斷是成立的：如果比丘試圖與除三孔穴之外的眾生身體的任何部分進行交合，那麼這種情況就屬於《僧殘》戒條的範疇－若非\ `《僧殘》一`_\ 代表故意射精，則為\ `《僧殘》二`_\ 代表出於性欲的身體接觸－而不是這裡。

   * - **Blanket exemptions**
     - **總括性豁免**

   * - In addition to bhikkhus who do not know they are being assaulted or do not give their consent when they do know, the Vibhaṅga states that there are four special categories of bhikkhus exempted from a penalty under this rule: any bhikkhu who is insane, possessed by spirits, delirious with pain, or the first offender(s) (in this case, Ven. Sudinna and the bhikkhu with the monkey) whose actions prompted the Buddha to formulate the rule. The Commentary defines as *insane* anyone who “goes about in an unseemly way, with deranged perceptions, having cast away all sense of shame and compunction, not knowing whether he has transgressed major or minor training rules.” It recognizes this as a medical condition, which it blames on the bile. A bhikkhu under the influence of a severe psychosis-inducing drug would apparently fall under this exemption, but one under the influence of a more common intoxicant would not. As for spirit possession, the Commentary says that this can happen either when spirits frighten one or when, by distracting one with sensory images, they insert their hands into one’s heart by way of one’s mouth (!). Whatever the cause, it notes that insane and possessed bhikkhus are exempt from penalties they incur only when their perceptions are deranged (“when their mindfulness is entirely forgotten and they don’t know what fire, gold, excrement, and sandalwood are”) and not from any they incur during their lucid moments. As for a bhikkhu delirious with pain, he is exempt from penalties he incurs only during periods when the pain is so great that he does not know what he is doing.

     - 除了不知道自己受到侵犯或明知後不同意的比丘外，《經分別》指出，有四種特殊類別的比丘可免受此戒條的處罰：任何精神錯亂的比丘、被附身、或因痛苦而發狂神智不清，或最初犯戒者（在本例中，是須提那尊者和與猴子在一起的比丘），他們的行為促使佛陀制定了戒條。《義註》將\ *精神錯亂*\ 定義為「行為不得體，知覺錯亂，已拋棄所有慚愧感，不知犯大、小學處」的人。它認為這是一種健康狀況，並將其歸咎於膽汁。受到嚴重的誘發精神病藥物影響的比丘顯然屬於這裡的豁免範圍，但受到更常見的麻醉劑影響的比丘則不然。至於附身，《義註》說，這種情況可能發生在靈體嚇唬人的時候，或者當靈體通過感官圖像分散人的注意力，通過人的嘴將手插入人的心臟時（！）。無論出於什麼原因，它指出，精神錯亂和被附身的比丘只有在他們的知覺錯亂時（“當他們的正念完全被遺忘，並且他們不知道火，金，糞便和檀香是什麼時”）才可以免受懲罰，在清醒時所發生則不能豁免。至於因痛苦而發狂神智不清的比丘，只有當疼痛劇烈到他不知道自己在做什麼時，他才可以免於懲罰。

   * - These four categories are exempted from penalties under nearly all of the rules, although the first offender for each rule is exempted only for the one time he acted in such a way as to provoke the Buddha into formulating the rule. I will only rarely mention these categories again, and—except where expressly stated otherwise—the reader should bear them in mind as exempt in every case.

     - 這四類別幾乎在所有戒條中都可以免於處罰，儘管每條戒條的初犯只有一次，其行為引起佛陀制定該戒條時才可以得到豁免。我很少會再次提及這些類別，除非另有明確說明，否則讀者應該牢記它們在任何情況下都可以豁免。

          “At that time a certain bhikkhu had gone to the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood at Vesālī to pass the day and was sleeping, having left the door open. His various limbs were stiff with the ‘wind forces’ (i.e., he had an erection) (§). Now at that time a large company of women bearing garlands and scents came to the park, headed for the dwelling. Seeing the bhikkhu, they sat down on his male organ (§) and, having taken their pleasure and remarking, ‘What a bull of a man, this one!’ they picked up their garlands and scents, and left.”

     - .. container:: notification

          「當時，有一位比丘到毘舍離大林的重閣講堂去打發一天，正在睡覺，門開著。他的各個肢體因「風力」而變得僵硬（即他勃起）（§）。那時，一大群帶著花環和香水的婦女來到公園，朝著住所走去。看到比丘後，他們坐在他的男性器官上（§），取得愉悅後說道：「這個人真是個公牛！」他們拿起花環和香水就離開了。

   * - The bhikkhu incurred no penalty, but the Buddha gave formal permission to close the door when resting during the day. From this permission, the Commentary formulates a prohibition—that a bhikkhu incurs a dukkaṭa if he does not close the door when sleeping during the day—but if the Buddha had intended a prohibition, he surely would have stated the rule in that form himself. In other words, one may sleep during the day without being penalized for whether the door is open or not.

     - 比丘沒有受到懲罰，但佛陀正式允許白天休息時關門。根據這項許可，《義註》制定了一條禁令——比丘如果白天睡覺時不關門，就會犯《突吉羅》——但如果佛陀有意禁止，他肯定會親自以禁令形式陳述這條戒條。換句話說，比丘可以在白天睡覺，而不會因為門是否打開而受到懲罰。

   * - *Summary: Voluntary sexual intercourse—genital, anal, or oral—with a human being, non-human being, or common animal is a pārājika offense.*
     - *摘要：與人類、非人或普通動物自願發生性交（生殖器、肛門或口腔）是《波羅夷》罪。*

          *Should any bhikkhu, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness—just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief”—a bhikkhu in the same way taking what is not given also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘，在村落或林野，拿取未給予的東西，被視為盜竊，就像國王逮捕罪犯，拿取未給予的東西時會鞭打、監禁或驅逐他一樣說：「你是強盜，你是愚人，你是愚昧無知的，你是小偷。」——比丘以同樣的方式拿取未給予的東西，也是波羅夷，不共住。*

   * - This rule against stealing is, in the working out of its details, the most complex in the Pāṭimokkha and requires the most explanation—not because stealing is a concept especially hard to understand, but because it can take so many forms. The Canon treats the issue in a case-by-case fashion that resists easy summary. To further complicate matters, the Commentary’s discussion of this rule is extremely prolix and deviates frequently from the Canon’s in both major and minor ways. Because the deviations are so numerous, we will focus solely on the major ones.

     - 就其細節而言，這條禁止偷竊的戒條是《波羅提木叉》中最複雜的，也需要最多的解釋——不是因為偷竊是一個特別難以理解的概念，而是因為它可以有多種形式。《聖典》以逐案的的方式對待這個議題，拒絕簡單地總結。使事情變得更加複雜的是，《義註》對這條戒條的討論極其冗長，並且經常在主要和次要方面偏離《聖典》的內容。由於偏差如此之多，我們將只關注主要的偏差。

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines the act of stealing in terms of four factors.
     - 《經分別》根據四個因素定義了偷竊行為。

   * - 1) *Object*: anything belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.
     - 1) *對象*\ ：屬於另一個人或一群人的任何東西。

   * - 2) *Perception*: One perceives the object as belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.
     - 2) *感知*\ ：察覺到該對象屬於另一個人或一群人。

   * - 3) *Intention*: One decides to steal it.
     - 3) *意圖*\ ：決定偷竊它。

   * - 4) *Effort*: One takes it.
     - 4) *努力*\ ：拿走它。

   * - Stealing under any circumstances is always an offense. However, the severity of the offense depends on another factor, which is—
     - 在任何情況下偷竊都是犯戒行為。然而，犯戒的嚴重程度取決於另一個因素，即——

   * - 5) The value of the object.
     - 5) 該對象的價值。


.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - For an object to qualify as *what is not given*\ —the rule’s term for anything that may be the object of a theft—it must belong to someone else: “not given, not forfeited, not abandoned/discarded; guarded, protected, claimed (§—literally, ‘viewed as “mine”’), possessed by someone else.” In all of the Vibhaṅga’s cases under this rule, that “someone else” is either an individual human being or a group of human beings. The question of property belonging to the Saṅgha logically fits here, but because the topic is fairly complex we will discuss it as a special case below.

     - 一個對象要符合“\ *未給予*\ ”的條件（該戒條對可能成為盜竊對象的任何物品的術語），它必須屬於其他人：“未給予、未沒收喪失、未遺棄/丟棄；” 被看守、保護、聲稱（§—字面意思是“被視為‘我的’）、被其他人擁有。” 在這條戒條下的所有《經分別》案例中，「其他人」若非一個人，則為一群人。僧團財產的疑問在邏輯上適用於這裡，但由於這個主題相當複雜，我們將在下面作為一個特例來討論。

   * - Because items that have been given away or discarded do not fulfill the factor of object here, there is no offense for a bhikkhu who takes a discarded object—such as rags from a pile of refuse—or unclaimed items from a wilderness. The Commentary, in some of its examples, includes items given up for lost under “abandoned,” but this interpretation has to be heavily qualified. If the owner retains a sense of ownership for the lost item, it would fall under the term *claimed*, and thus would still count as not given. Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned.

     - 因為被送出或丟棄的物品不符合這裡的對象因素，所以對於比丘來說，拿走被丟棄的物品——例如一堆垃圾中的破布——或來自林野中無主的物品，並沒有犯戒。《義註》中的一些例子中，「遺棄」包括了因遺失而放棄的物品，但這種解釋必須經過嚴格限定。如果失主保留對遺失物品的所有權意識，則該物品將屬於\ *有主的*\ ，因此仍然算作未給予。只有擁有者放棄所有的所有權意識，才算真正的遺棄。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu mentions an interesting case in which the groundskeeper in an orchard permits bhikkhus to take fruit from the orchard, even though he was not authorized to do so. The bhikkhus committed no offense.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》提到了一個有趣的案例，`果園的園丁允許比丘們從果園拿水果`_，儘管他沒有被授權這樣做。比丘們沒有犯任何戒。

   * - The Commentary adds that if people are guarding an object as the property of a location—for example, an offering to a Buddha image, cetiya, or other sacred place—the object would also qualify as “not given” under this rule. Although the Vibhaṅga mentions property of this sort under `NP 30`_ and `Pc 82`_, for some reason it doesn’t mention it here. Nevertheless, the Commentary’s judgment on this point reflects a custom that had become widespread by its time, that of giving valuable items to a cetiya (this includes Buddha images) and dedicating them not to the Saṅgha but to the cetiya. Some medieval Indian Buddhist inscriptions express the idea that the cetiya or the Buddha relics (if any) within the cetiya actually own such objects, but the Commentary states that these objects have an owner simply in the sense that human beings are watching over them for the purpose of the cetiya. The jewels decorating the reliquary of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy or the offerings to the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok, for example, would fall under this category. According to the Commentary, the Saṅgha is duty-bound to care for such items but has no rights of ownership over them. In its discussion both of this rule and of Pv.XIX, it states that items given to the Saṅgha may be used for the purpose of the cetiya—for example, to contribute to its decoration or upkeep—but items given to the cetiya may not be used for the purpose of the Saṅgha.

     - 《義註》補充說，如果人們將某個物品作為某個地點的財產來保護——例如，供奉給佛像、\ `支提`_\ 或其他神聖場所的供品——根據這條戒條，該物品也將被視為“未給予”。儘管《經分別》在\ `《捨墮》三十`_\ 和\ `《波逸提》八二`_\ 中提到了此類財產，但由於某種原因，它在這裡沒有提及。然而，《義註》對這一點的判斷反映了當時流行的一種習俗，即向\ `支提`_\ （包括佛像）贈送貴重物品，將它們奉獻給\ `支提`_\ ，而不是僧團。一些中世紀印度佛教銘文表達了這樣的想法，即\ `支提`_\ 或\ `支提`_\ 內的佛舍利（如果有的話）實際上擁有這些物品，但《義註》指出，這些物品有主人，只因有人為了\ `支提`_\ 的緣故正在看守它們。例如，在\ `康提`_\ 裝飾\ `佛牙`_\ 箱的珠寶或曼谷供奉\ `玉佛`_\ 的供品就屬於這一類。根據《義註》，僧團有義務保管這些物品，但沒有所有權。在對該戒條和\ `《附隨》`_\ 一九的討論中，它指出給予僧伽的物品可以用於\ `支提`_\ —例如，有助於其裝飾或維護—但給予\ `支提`_\ 的物品不可作為僧伽之用。

   * - From the Commentary’s discussion of this type of ownership, it would appear that if there are no longer any human beings watching over a cetiya, the items donated to it would no longer count as having an owner and thus could be removed for safekeeping, preferably to another cetiya. Any bhikkhu who took such items for himself, however, would be risking the wrath of the devas who might be guarding the cetiya. This is why it is traditional in such cases to conduct a ceremony formally requesting the permission of any guardian devas, at the same time promising not to take such items for one’s own use.

     - 從《義註》對這種類型所有權的討論來看，如果不再有任何人看管\ `支提`_\ ，捐贈給它的物品將不再被視為有主物，因此可以被移走以妥善保管，最好是移到另一個\ `支提`_\ 。然而，任何比丘若將這些物品據為己有，就會冒著觸怒可能守護\ `支提`_\ 的天神的風險。這就是為什麼在這種情況下，傳統上會舉行儀式，正式請求任何守護天神的許可，同時承諾不會將這些物品據為己用。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that items belonging to common animals or petas are not covered by this rule. On this point, see the discussion under Non-offenses, below.

     - 《經分別》說，屬於一般動物或鬼的物品不屬於此戒條的範圍。關於這一點，請參閱下面「不犯」部分的討論。

   :widths: auto

   * - **Perception**
     - **感知**

   * - For the act of taking what is not given to count as theft, one must also perceive the object as not given. Thus there is no offense if one takes an object, even if it is not given, if one sincerely believes that it is ownerless or thrown away. Similarly, if a bhikkhu takes an object mistaking it for his own or as belonging to a friend who has given him permission to take his things on trust, there is no offense even if the assumption about the trust proves to be a misperception. Also, a bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, on the assumption that he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false.

     - 將未給予而拿取算做盜竊的行為，該人必須察覺該物品是未給予的。因此，如果一個人真誠地相信它是無主的或被丟棄的，那麼即使它是未給予的，如果該人拿走了它，也沒有犯戒。同樣地，如果比丘拿走一件物品，誤認為它是他自己的，或者是屬於一位允許他以信託方式拿走他的東西的朋友的，即使有關信託的假設被證明是一種誤解，也沒有犯戒。此外，比丘假設他有權利自助，從僧團的公共儲藏中拿東西，即使這個假設被證明是錯的，也沒有犯戒。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu, spotting some objects during the day, returns to steal them at night. However, instead of taking the objects he spotted, he ends up taking some possessions of his own. He earns a dukkaṭa for his efforts.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中有一個案例，一位比丘在白天發現一些物品，然後在晚上回來偷它們。然而，他最終沒有拿走他發現的物品，而是拿走了自己的一些所有物。他透過自己的努力犯了《突吉羅》。

   * - None of the texts discuss the possible case in which one might be in doubt as to whether the object in question is not given, perhaps because the compilers felt that the factor of intention, discussed next, would not apply in such cases. Thus it would not be an offense under this rule. However, the wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan, as explained below.

     - 沒有任何文本討論懷疑該物品是否尚未給予的這種可能情況，也許是因為編譯者認為接下來討論的意圖因素不適用於這種情況。因此，根據該戒條，這不會構成犯戒。然而，當一個人對某件物品的所有權有疑問時，明智之舉是不要將其據為己有，或最多借用它，如下所述。


.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The act of taking what is not given, even when one perceives it as not given, counts as theft only if one’s intention is to steal it. Thus, as the non-offense clauses say, a bhikkhu incurs no offense if he takes an object temporarily or on trust. On these points, see the discussion under Non-offenses, below. Also, the Vinīta-vatthu rules that a bhikkhu who, seeing an article left in a place where it might be damaged, puts it in safe keeping for the owner, commits no offense.

     - 拿取未給予之物的行為，即使察覺到它尚未給予，只有當一個人的意圖是偷竊它時，才算是偷竊。因此，正如不犯條款所說，比丘如果暫時或受託取用某物，並不會犯戒。關於這點，請參閱下面「不犯」部分的討論。此外，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》規定，比丘看到一件物品被留在可能會被損壞的地方，為該物主妥善保管，這並不構成犯戒。

   * - The Commentary discusses two cases of taking an item with a conditional intent *(parikappāvahāra)*: placing a condition on the article, and placing a condition on the place. It illustrates the first case with the example of a bhikkhu entering a dark storeroom and taking a sack full of items, thinking, “If the sack contains cloth, I’ll steal it; if it contains just thread, I won’t.” In this case, if the sack does indeed contain cloth, then it was stolen the moment the bhikkhu moved the sack from its place (see below). If it contains just thread, and he returns it to its place, he commits no offense. If, however, the bhikkhu takes the sack thinking, “I’ll steal whatever is in the sack,” the Commentary maintains that he is not guilty of stealing until he finds out what the sack contains and then picks it up again, but this case does not really fit under this category, as the bhikkhu has actually placed no condition on the article and so stole it when he first picked it up.

     - 《義註》討論了帶有條件意圖\ *（parikappāvahāra）*\ 拿取物品的兩種情況：對物品設定條件，以及對地點設定條件。它用一個比丘的例子來說明第一個情況，他進入一個黑暗的儲藏室，拿起一袋裝滿物品的袋子，心想：「如果袋子裡有布，我就偷它；如果它只包含線，我不偷。」在這種情況下，如果袋子裡確實裝有布，那麼當比丘把袋子從原來的位置移開時，它就被偷了（見下文）。如果裡面只有線，他把它放回原處，他就沒有犯戒。然而，如果比丘拿起袋子時心裡想：「我要偷袋子裡的東西」，《義註》認為，在他發現袋子裡裝著什麼，然後再把它拿起來之前，他並沒有犯偷竊，但這個情況並不真正屬於這一類，因為比丘實際上沒有對這個物品設定任何條件，所以當他第一次拿起它時就偷走了它。

   * - *Placing a condition on the place* means thinking, “If I can take this item past such-and-such a place (such as a gateway), I’ll steal it; if anyone sees me beforehand, I’ll pretend that I’m just looking at it and will return it to its place.” Because one has not definitely decided to steal it when first picking it up, the theft is committed only when one takes the item past the determined place.

     - *對地點設定條件*\ 意味著心想：「如果我可以帶著這個物品通過某某地點（例如出入口），我就會偷它；如果有人先看到我，我會假裝我只是在看它，把它放回原處。」由於第一次拿起物品時並沒有明確決定要偷竊，只有當拿物品通過了決意的地點時才算偷竊。


.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - Assuming that all of the above conditions are met—the object belongs to someone else, one perceives it as belonging to someone else, and one intends to steal it—if one then takes it, that constitutes stealing. The question then arises as to precisely what acts constitute *taking*.

     - 假設上述所有條件都滿足，即該物品是別人的，自己察覺到該物是屬於別人的，並意圖去偷竊它—如果拿走了它，就構成偷竊。那麼問題來了，究竟什麼行為才構成\ *拿取*\ 。

   * - The Vibhaṅga, instead of giving a systematic answer to this question, provides a long list of possible situations and then defines how *taking* is defined in each case. Simply reading through the list can require some patience, and it’s easy to sympathize with the bhikkhus in the past who had to memorize it. Here, to shorten the discussion, we will reverse its order, listing first the actions that qualify as taking and then the situations to which the actions apply. Actions requiring only minor clarification will be explained in the list; those requiring extended discussion will be explained below.

     - 《經分別》並沒有對這個問題給出系統的答案，而是提供了一長串可能的情況，然後定義了在每種情況下的怎樣算是「\ *拿取*\ 」。單純地閱讀這個列單可能需要一些耐心，而且很容易同情過去必須記住它的比丘們。在這裡，為了縮短討論，我們將顛倒其順序，首先列出符合「拿取」的行動，然後列出這些行動適用的情況。只需要進行少量澄清的行動將在列表中進行解釋；下文將解釋那些需要進一步討論的內容。

   * - *Moving the object from its place:* objects buried in the ground; sitting on the ground; sitting on another object sitting on the ground; hanging from a place above ground, such as a peg or clothesline; floating, flying, or dropping in mid-air; sitting in a boat; sitting in a vehicle; an object that one has caused another person to drop; footless animals, animals that one might pick up or push from their place (according to the Commentary, this also covers larger footed animals that are lying down); objects that one has been asked to guard. The Vibhaṅga makes clear that items in a vehicle also count as taken when the vehicle is moved from its place.

     - *將物品從原來的位置移動：*\ 埋在地下的物品；坐在地上；坐在地上的另一個物品上；懸掛在地面以上的地方，例如掛鉤或晾衣繩；漂浮、飛行或掉落在半空中；坐在船上；坐在車內；一個人導致另一個人掉落的物品；無足動物，人們可能會從其所在位置拿起或推走的動物（根據《義註》，這也包括躺著的較大有足動物）；被要求看守的物品。《經分別》明確規定，當車輛從其位置移動時，在車輛中的物品也算作被拿走。

   * - *“Cutting off” a fistful:* objects inside a container. According to the Commentary, this means reaching into the container and grabbing, say, a fistful of coins in such a way that the coins in the fist do not touch any of the other coins in the container. In this case, the taking would be accomplished before the object was removed from the container.

     - *「切掉」一把：*\ 容器內的物品。根據《義註》，這意味著伸手進入容器並抓住一把硬幣，使得拳頭中的硬幣不接觸容器中的任何其他硬幣。在這種情況下，在將物品從容器中取出之前就完成了「拿取」。

   * - *Sticking a vessel into a pool of liquid or pile of objects and causing some of the pool or pile to enter the vessel:* objects inside a container; water or any liquid, whether in a container or not. Again, the Commentary states that the objects or liquid in one’s vessel must not touch the remaining objects or liquid outside the vessel. And, again, in the case of taking objects or liquid situated in a container in this way, the taking would be accomplished before the objects or liquid were removed from the container.

     - *將器皿插入一池液體或一堆物體中，並使一池液體或一堆物體中的一些進入器皿：*\ 容器內的物體；水或任何液體，無論是否在容器中。《義註》再次指出，器皿中的物體或液體不得接觸器皿外的剩餘物體或液體。並且，再次，在以這種方式拿取位於容器中的物體或液體的情況下，「拿取」將在物體或液體從器皿中移出之前完成。

   * - *Removing entirely from the mouth of a container:* objects too long or large to be taken from a container in a vessel or fistful.
     - *完全從容器口中取出：*\ 太長或太大而無法從容器中以器皿拿取或一把拿取的物體。

   * - *Drinking liquid from a container:* This would apply to drinking from the container without moving the container from its place. If the container is moved from its place, that would constitute the taking. As with the fistful, the Commentary argues that the liquid is taken only when the liquid ingested does not make contact with the liquid not ingested. This can be done either by swallowing, by closing one’s lips, or by removing one’s mouth from the container.

     - *從容器中飲用液體：*\ 這適用於在不將容器移離其位置的情況下從容器中飲用液體。若容器被移離其原位，則構成「拿取」。與一把一樣，《義註》認為只有當攝入的液體不與未攝入的液體接觸時才算「拿取」液體。這可以透過吞嚥、閉上嘴唇或將嘴從容器移開來完成。

   * - *Moving the object from one part of one’s body to another:* an object that one is already carrying before deciding to steal it. The Vibhaṅga recognizes five body parts here: head, upper torso, hip, and each of the hands. The Commentary defines *head* as anything above the neck; *upper torso* as anything below the head down, on the torso, to the level of the sternum, and on the arm, to the elbow; *hip* as the remainder of the body below the upper torso; and *hand* as the arm from the elbow on down. The Commentary notes that this definition applies only to cases where the owners have not asked one to carry the article for them. Neither the Commentary nor the Sub-commentary explains this condition, but a possible reason might be that if they have asked a bhikkhu to carry the article for them, without their intending for him to give it to someone else, it would count as guarded by him or deposited with him for safe keeping, and thus would fall under another category. If, on the other hand, they asked him to carry the object to give to someone else and he decided to take it for himself, the case would come under Deceit, discussed below.

     - *將物品從身體的一個部位移動到另一個部位：*\ 在決定偷竊之前已經攜帶的物品。《經分別》在這裡識別出五個身體部位：頭部、上軀幹、臀部和每隻手。《義註》將\ *頭部*\ 定義為頸部以上的任何部位；\ *上軀幹*\ ，為頭部以下、軀幹至胸骨水平、手臂至手肘；\ *臀部*\ 是上軀幹以下身體的其餘部分；\ *手*\ ，為手臂從手肘以下。《義註》指出，這項定義僅適用於所有者未要求他人為其搬運物品的情況。《義註》和《複註》都沒有解釋這個條件，但一個可能的原因是，如果他們要求比丘為他們攜帶該物品，而不是想讓他將其交給其他人，那麼該物品將被視為由比丘守護，或存放在他那裡安全保管，因此屬於另一類。另一方面，如果他們要求他攜帶該物品送給其他人，而他決定將其據為己有，則該情況將屬於如下所述的\ **欺詐**\ 行為。

   * - *Dropping the object:* an object one is already carrying before deciding to steal it.
     - *掉落物品：*\ 在決定偷竊前已經攜帶的物品。

   * - *Causing the object to move a hairbreadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water:* a boat or any similar vessel floating in water.
     - *導致物體向上游、下游或穿過水體移動毫髮寬度：*\ 一艘船或漂浮在水中的任何類似載體。

   * - *Breaking an embankment so that water flows out:* water in a lake, canal, or reservoir.
     - *破壞堤防使水流出：*\ 湖泊、運河或水庫中的水。

   * - *Causing an animal to move all its feet:* two-footed (this includes human beings, i.e., slaves), four-footed, many-footed animals. According to the Commentary, this applies whether one touches the animal or simply lures it or threatens it without touching it. If the animal is lying down, simply getting it to get up on its feet counts as taking it. In the case of helping a slave to escape from slavery, if the slave follows one’s order or advice to escape, one is guilty of taking; but if one simply informs the slave of good ways to reach freedom or offers food or protection along the way, one incurs no offense.

     - *使動物移動其所有的腳：*\ 兩足動物（這包括人類，即奴隸）、四足動物、多足動物。根據《義註》，無論是接觸動物還是只是引誘它或威脅它而不觸摸它，這都適用。如果動物躺著，只要讓它站起來就可以算「拿取」它。在幫助奴隸逃脫奴隸身份的情況下，如果奴隸聽從某人的命令或建議逃跑，則犯了「拿取」；但是，如果一個人只是告訴奴隸獲得自由的好方法，或者沿途提供食物或保護，那麼就不會犯戒。

   * - *Cutting down:* plants growing in place, whether on dry land or in a body of water. The Commentary states that once the plant is cut totally through, then even though it doesn’t yet fall down—as when a tree is entangled in the branches of neighboring trees—it is nevertheless taken.

     - *砍伐：*\ 植物就地生長，無論是在旱地或水體。《義註》指出，一旦植物被完全砍斷，即使它還沒有倒下——就像一棵樹被鄰近樹木的樹枝纏住一樣——它仍然是被「拿取」了。

   * - *Causing the owner to give up efforts (§) to regain possession:* pieces of land (fields, orchards, building sites), buildings, objects deposited with a bhikkhu for safekeeping. (According to the Commentary, items loaned to a bhikkhu also fall into this category.) According to the Vibhaṅga, if a case of this sort goes to court, this type of taking is completed when the owner finally loses the case. The Vinaya-mukha adds that if the owner appeals the case after the first hearing, the taking is accomplished when the owner loses in the highest court to which he/she makes an appeal.

     - *導致所有者放棄重新擁有的努力（§）：*\ 土地（田地、果園、建築工地）、建築物、交由比丘保管的物品。（根據《義註》，借給比丘的物品也屬於這一類。）根據《經分別》，如果此類案件進入法庭，當所有者最終敗訴時，這種類型的「拿取」就完成了。《戒律入口》補充說，如果所有者在第一次聽證會後對案件提出上訴，則當所有者在他/她提出上訴的最高法院敗訴時，「拿取」就完成了。

   * - The discussion in the Commentary and Sub-commentary indicates that the two categories of “objects a bhikkhu has been asked to guard,” and “objects deposited with a bhikkhu for safe keeping” differ in that in the latter case the object has been handed to the bhikkhu, whereas in the former it hasn’t. This, however, does not fit with the Vibhaṅga, which in defining “deposited” uses the word *upanikkhitaṁ*, which in `NP 18`_ means “placed down next to.” A way to distinguish the two categories more closely in line with the Vibhaṅga would be to say that, in the latter case, the object is in such a location that the owner, in order to retrieve it, would have to ask the bhikkhu’s permission to do so, whereas in the former he/she wouldn’t. For example, an item placed in the bhikkhu’s hut or a monastery storeroom would count as deposited with the bhikkhu—regardless of whether it had been handed to him—whereas an item set by the side of a public road—with the bhikkhu simply asked to watch over it for a short period of time—would count as an object he has been asked to guard.

     - 《義註》和《複註》中的討論表明，「比丘被要求看守的物品」和「存放給比丘妥善保管的物品」這兩類的不同之處在於，在後一種情況下，該物品已被交給比丘，而前者卻沒有。然而，這與《經分別》不符，《經分別》在定義「存放」時使用了「\ *upanikkhitaṁ*\ 」一詞，在\ `《捨墮》一八`_\ 中意思是「放置在旁邊」。一種更符合《經分別》的區分這兩個類別的方法是，在後一種情況下，物品所在的位置使得所有者為了取回它，必須徵求比丘的許可取回，而在前者中他/她不必。例如，放置在比丘小屋（孤邸）或寺院儲藏室中的物品將被視為存放在比丘那裡——無論它是否已交給他——而放置在公共道路旁的物品——比丘只被要求短時間看管——就算是被要求看守的物品。

       .. TODO FIXME: replace link to 《捨墮》一八

   * - *Shifting a boundary marker:* pieces of land. The Vinaya-mukha notes that this contradicts the preceding definition of how one takes a piece of land, as the owner might not even know that the marker had been moved, and would not necessarily give up ownership even if he/she saw a bhikkhu moving it. The Sub-commentary tries to explain the discrepancy by maintaining that shifting a boundary marker fulfills the factor of effort here only if the act of shifting the marker, in and of itself, induces the owner to give up any efforts to reclaim the land, but that would make this category superfluous. A better explanation would be that this definition of taking applies to attempts to lay claim to Saṅgha land, for otherwise—if land can be stolen only when the owner abandons ownership—then Saṅgha land could not be stolen, because there is no one acting for the Saṅgha of the Four Directions who could renounce once and for all any efforts to reclaim the land.

     - *移動界碑：*\ 一塊土地。《戒律入口》指出，這與前面關於如何「拿取」一塊土地的定義相矛盾，因為所有者甚至可能不知道界碑已被移動，即使他/她看到比丘移動，也不一定會放棄所有權。《複註》試圖解釋這種差異，認為只有當移動界碑的行為本身導致所有者放棄任何收回土地的努力時，移動界碑才滿足此處的努力因素，但這將使這個類別變得多餘。更好的解釋是，這種「拿取」的定義適用於試圖聲稱擁有僧伽土地所有權，否則——如果土地只有在所有者放棄所有權時才能被盜——那麼僧伽土地就不可能被盜，因為沒有人可以代表四方僧伽一勞永逸地放棄任何收回土地的努力。

   * - Of these various ways of taking, the Commentary devotes the most space to the first, “moving the object from its place.” Its discussion is at odds with the Canon on many points, most notably in striking out the separate categories for taking large objects from a container (removing it entirely from the mouth of a container) and boats (causing them to move a hair-breadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water), and simply subsuming them under this category. Although it may have regarded these separate categories as arbitrary, it introduces many arbitrary distinctions and inconsistencies of its own. Apparently its distinctions come from the ancient commentaries, for even Buddhaghosa expresses despair at trying to commit them all to writing. Here we will stick with the Canon’s scheme for defining the act of taking, and focus on the parts of the Commentary’s discussion that accord with the Canon. As for those that deviate from the Canon, only important deviations will be noted.

     - 在這些不同的「拿取」方式中，《義註》用了最多的篇幅來描述第一種，「將物品從原來的位置移動」。它的討論在許多方面與《聖典》不一致，最值得注意的是，刪除了從容器中拿取大型物體（將其完全從容器口取出）和船隻（導致它們向上游、下游或穿過水體移動毫髮寬度）的單獨類別，並單純地將它們歸入此類別。儘管它可能認為這些單獨的類別是隨意的，但它自己卻引入了許多隨意的區分和不一致。顯然，它的區分來自古代註釋，因為即使是\ `佛音`_\ 也對試圖將它們全部寫入文字表示絕望。這裡我們將堅持《聖典》定義「拿取」行為的方案，並著重在《義註》中符合《聖典》的部分。至於那些偏離《聖典》的內容，只會指出重要的偏差。

   * - In general, the Commentary defines an object’s place in terms of the directions in which it can be moved: up, down (as when an object sitting on sand can be pushed down into the sand), left, right, forward (toward the person taking it), and away. With reference to the last five of these actions, the place of the object is defined in three-dimensional terms: the space it occupies. Thus to take an object in any of these directions, one must push or pull it entirely outside of the coordinates of the space it initially occupied. However, with reference to lifting the object up, the place is defined in two-dimensional terms: the area of contact between the object and its support, whether that support is another object or the ground. Thus to take an object by lifting it, one only need lift it a hairbreadth from its support.

     - 總體來說，《義註》根據物體可以被移動的方向來定義物體的位置：上、下（如當坐在沙上的物體可以被推入沙子時）、左、右、前進（朝向拿取者），和遠離。關於這些動作中的最後五個，物體的位置是用三維術語定義的：它所佔據的空間。因此，要沿著這些方向中的任何一個方向拿取物體，必須將其完全推或拉到其最初佔據的空間座標之外。然而，關於舉起物體，該位置是用二維術語定義的：物體與其支撐物之間的接觸面積，無論該支撐物是另一個物體還是地面。因此，要舉起一個物體來拿取，只需將其從支撐物上舉起毫髮寬度即可。

   * - For example, a television set on a shelf is taken either when it is slid left along the shelf to the point where its right side is just left of where the left side used to be, or slid right to the point where its left side is just right of where the right side used to be, or lifted a hairbreadth off the shelf.

     - 例如，當架子上的電視機沿著架子向左滑動到其右側恰好位於原本左側的左邊時，或是向右滑動到其左側恰好位於原本右側的右邊時，或是從架子上抬起了毫髮寬度，就算被拿取。

   * - Because objects in the air have no support, the Commentary defines their space in three-dimensional terms no matter which direction they are moved. For instance, if one catches a piece of cloth being blown by the wind, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment one catches it. If one stops a flying peacock without touching it, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment it stops to hover. In either case, the object is taken when displaced any direction outside the coordinates of that space. In the case of the cloth, this could be done simply by dropping it. In the case of the peacock, it could be done by waving one’s hands and getting it to fly in the desired direction. If the peacock happens to land on one’s arm, it is taken when one moves it to another part of one’s body or puts it down.

     - 由於空氣中的物體沒有支撐，因此無論它們被向哪個方向移動，《義註》都以三維術語定義它們的空間。比如說，如果你抓住一塊被風吹動的布，它所在的位置就是一個人在抓住它的那一刻所佔據的三維空間。如果一個人停止一隻飛翔的孔雀而不觸碰它，那麼它所在的位置就是它停止盤旋那一刻所佔據的三維空間。在任何一種情況下，當物體被移位到在該空間的座標之外的任何方向時，就算被拿取。就布料而言，只需將其掉落就算完成拿取。就孔雀而言，只需揮動雙手，讓它朝著想要的方向飛去就算完成拿取。如果孔雀剛好落在一個人的手臂上，當一個人將它移到身體的另一個部位或將它放下時，就算被拿取。

   * - For animals swimming in water, it would make sense to define place in the same terms as birds flying in the air, but the Commentary insists that the entire body of water in which they are kept constitutes their place.

     - 對於在水中游泳的動物來說，用與在空中飛行的鳥類相同的術語來定義位置也說得通，但《義註》堅持認為它們所在的整個水體構成了它們的位置。

   * - Objects on a living person—such as a bracelet on the person’s arm—have the person’s body as their place. Thus if, in trying to remove the bracelet, one pulls it up and down the arm, it is not yet taken. It is taken only when one removes it entirely from the hand. If one is stealing the person’s clothes, they are taken only when removed from his/her body. If the person, stripped of the clothes, is still holding onto them, they are taken only when pulled from his/her hand.

     - 活人身上的物體（例如人手臂上的手鐲）以人的身體作為其位置。因此，如果在試圖取下手鐲時，將其在手臂上下拉動，則手鐲尚未被拿取。只有當一個人將手鐲完全從手中拿開時，才算被拿取。如果有人偷了某人的衣服，只有當衣服從他/她身上脫下來時才算被拿取。如果被剝去衣服的人仍然抓著衣服，只有從他/她的手中拉出衣服時，衣服才算被拿取。

   * - For some objects, the Commentary defines *place* in terms that seem rather arbitrary. For instance, a robe on a line is taken when it is lifted a hairbreadth off the line, but for some reason if it is moved along the line it is not taken until it is ten or twelve fingerbreadths away from the area it originally occupied on the line. An object leaning against a wall has two places: the spot where it sits on the ground and the spot it touches on the wall. A vehicle’s place is defined two-dimensionally: the spots where its wheels touch the ground (perhaps this is defined on analogy with the feet of an animal). An object tied to a post has that connection as an extra part of its place. Thus a pot tied by a chain to a post is not taken until it is removed from the area it occupied under the general definition above *and* either the chain is cut or the post pulled up. Although there is a certain logic to each of these cases, the added distinctions seem unnecessary complications added to an already complicated issue. For simplicity’s sake there would seem every reason to stick with the general definition of place even in these special cases, although there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove or disprove the Commentary here.

     - 對於某些物體，《義註》對\ *位置*\ 的定義似乎相當隨意。例如，當一條線上的袈裟被提高離該線一毫髮寬度時，它就算被拿取，但由於某種原因，如果它沿著該線被移動，直到它距離它在該線上原來佔據的區域十或十二個手指寬度時，它才算被拿取。靠在牆上的物體有兩個位置：它位於地面上的位置和它接觸牆壁的位置。車輛的位置是二維定義的：車輪接觸地面的點（也許這是透過類比動物的腳來定義的）。綁在柱子上的物體將該連接作為其位置的額外部分。因此，用鏈條綁在柱子上的罐子不算被拿取，直到將其從根據上面一般定義的所佔據區域移開\ *並且*\ 鏈條被切斷或柱子被拔起為止。儘管每種情況都有一定的邏輯，但增加的差異似乎為本已複雜的問題增添了不必要的複雜性。為了簡單起見，即使在這些特殊情況下，似乎也有充分的理由堅持位置的一般定義，儘管《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明或反駁這裡的《義註》。

   * - However, as noted above, several of the Commentary’s definitions of *place* clearly contradict the Vibhaṅga. In some cases, the contradiction is simple, as when the Commentary insists that an animal kept in an enclosure—a cow in a pen, a peacock in a garden—is taken not when its feet are moved, but only when removed from the enclosure. In other cases, the contradiction is more complex, in that the Commentary tries to define *taking* as “moving the object from its place” in cases where the Vibhaṅga defines the act of taking in other terms. For example, with an object sitting in the bottom of a container, it says that the object is taken when lifted a hairbreadth from the bottom, there being no need to remove the object from the container before it is considered taken. In the case of a boat, the Commentary defines the place of the boat in modified three-dimensional terms: the entire space where the boat displaces water. To take it by pushing it down in the water, the top of the boat has to sink lower than the level where the keel originally was; to take it by lifting it up, one need only lift it a hairbreadth above the water, there being no need to lift the keel to a point higher than where the highest point of the boat was. However, because the Vibhaṅga does not define the taking of boats or objects in containers in terms of “moving the object from its place,” the Commentary’s analysis of these possibilities is beside the point.

     - 然而，如上所述，《義註》中對\ *位置*\ 的一些定義顯然與《經分別》相矛盾。在某些情況下，矛盾很簡單，例如當《義註》堅持認為飼養在圍起來的區域中的動物（圍欄中的牛，花園中的孔雀）不是在其腳移動時才被拿取，而是只有在從圍起來的區域中移出時才被拿取。在其他情況下，矛盾更為複雜，因為《義註》試圖將「\ *拿取*\ 」定義為「將物品從原來的位置移動」，而《經分別》以其他術語定義「拿取」的行為。例如，如果一個物體位於容器的底部，它說該物體從底部抬起一毫髮寬度時就被拿取了，在該物體被視為拿取之前，不需要將其從容器中取出。就船隻的情況而言，《義註》以修改後的三維術語定義了船隻的位置：船排開水的整個空間。為了透過將其推入水中來拿取它，船的頂部必須下沉到低於船的龍骨原來所在的水平；為了透過舉起來拿取它，只需將其舉出水面一毫髮寬度即可，無需將龍骨舉得高於船之前的最高點。然而，由於《經分別》並沒有將拿取船隻或容器中的物體定義為「將物品從原來的位置移動」，因此《義註》對這些可能性的分析是不是重點，與主題無關。

   * - Other special cases in the Vibhaṅga include the following:
     - 《經分別》中的其他特殊情況包含如下：

   * - *a. Swindling:* Objects are being distributed by lot to the Community, and a bhikkhu takes the portion rightfully going to another bhikkhu. The Vibhaṅga offers no further explanation, but the Commentary states that the taking can be accomplished in various ways. If, after the drawing of the tickets, X puts his ticket in the place of Y’s ticket before picking up Y’s, the taking is accomplished when he picks up Y’s. If he picks up Y’s before putting his own ticket in its place, the taking is accomplished when he lets go of his own. If both tickets don’t appear (they’ve been concealed?) and X gets Y to take X’s portion, the taking is accomplished when he then picks up Y’s portion. The underlying assumption in all this is that Y’s portion belongs to him as soon as he has drawn the ticket for it. The Commentary adds that this exchange counts as theft regardless of whether X’s portion is worth more than Y’s, less than Y’s, or the two portions are of equal value.

     - *a. 詐騙：*\ 物品以抽籤的方式分發給僧團，一個比丘理應拿取的部份卻到了另一個比丘那裡。《經分別》沒有提供進一步的解釋，但《義註》指出，可以透過多種方式完成拿取。如果在抽籤後，X 在拿取 Y 的籤之前，將自己的籤放在 Y 的籤的位置上，則當他拿取 Y 的籤時，即完成拿取。如果他在將自己的籤放回原來的位置之前拿起 Y 的籤，那麼當他放開自己的籤時，就完成了拿取。如果兩張籤都沒有出現（它們被隱藏了？）並且 X 讓 Y 拿走了 X 的部分，那麼當他拿起 Y 的部分時，拿取就完成了。所有這一切的基本假設是，一旦 Y 抽出籤，Y 的部分就屬於 Y 了。《義註》補充說，無論 X 的部分價值高於 Y 的價值、低於 Y 的價值，還是兩部分價值相等，這種交換都算是竊盜。

   * - The Commentary to `Mv.I.62`_ adds that if a bhikkhu claims higher seniority than is actually his in order to obtain better donations, he should be treated under this rule when, through this ruse, he obtains donations that should have gone to another bhikkhu. However, this type of action would appear to fall under Deceit, discussed below.

     - `《大品》.一.62`_\ 的《義註》補充說，如果一個比丘為了獲得更好的布施而聲稱比他實際的戒臘更高，那麼當他通過這種詭計獲得了本應交給另一位比丘的布施時，他應該受到這條戒條的處置。然而，這種類型的行為似乎屬於\ **欺詐**\ 行為，如下所述。

   * - *b. Smuggling:* A bhikkhu carrying items subject to an import duty hides them as he goes through customs. The taking is accomplished when the item leaves the customs area. The Vibhaṅga calculates the value of the object here, for the purpose of determining the seriousness of the offense, by the duty owed on it, and not its actual selling price.

     - *b. 走私：*\ 一名比丘攜帶需繳納進口關稅的物品，在通過\ `海關`_\ 時將其隱藏起來。當物品離開海關區域時，「拿取」即完成。為了確定犯戒的嚴重性，《經分別》在此計算物品的價值，是根據其所欠的關稅，而不是其實際售價。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu states that there is no penalty if the bhikkhu goes through customs not knowing that he has an item subject to import duties among his effects. The relevant cases show that this can mean one of two things: Either he knows that he has the item with him but not that it is subject to import duties; or he does not know that he has the item with him at all. The Commentary adds that if a bhikkhu informs the customs official that he has an item subject to import duties and yet the official decides not to collect the duty, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. It also states that if a bhikkhu goes through customs with a conditional intent—“If they ask to see my belongings, I’ll pay the fee, but if they wave me through I won’t”—then if the officials do wave him through without asking to see his belongings, he incurs no offense. At present, when people entering a country are asked to choose different passageways through a customs area, marked “Goods to declare” and “Nothing to declare,” a bhikkhu with goods to declare who enters the “Nothing to declare” passageway cannot take advantage of this allowance for conditional intent, as he has already indicated an unconditional intent through his choice of a passageway.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》說，如果比丘在通關時不知道他的財物中含有需繳納進口關稅的物品，則不犯戒。相關案例表明，這可能意味著以下兩件事之一：要麼他知道他隨身攜帶該物品，但不知道該物品需要繳納進口關稅；或者他根本不知道他帶著該物品。《義註》補充說，如果比丘通知海關官員他有一件物品需要繳納進口關稅，但官員決定不徵收關稅，則比丘不犯戒。它還指出，如果比丘帶著有條件的意圖通過海關——「如果他們要求查看我的物品，我會支付費用，但如果他們揮手讓我通過，我不會」——那麼如果官員確實揮手讓他通過，沒有要求查看他的物品，他不犯戒。目前，當人們入境時被要求選擇不同的通道通過海關區域，標有「貨物需申報」和「無需申報」的通道，攜帶有貨物需申報的比丘進入「無需申報」通道時，不能利用有條件意圖的開緣，因為他已經透過選擇通道表明了無條件的意圖。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if, to avoid paying an import duty at a frontier, one crosses the frontier in such a way as to evade the customs area (§), one incurs only a dukkaṭa. At present, the civil law judges this sort of behavior as more reprehensible than slipping an item through customs, but from the point of view of the Vinaya the lesser penalty still holds. The Commentary says that this allowance applies only in cases when one evades the customs area by a distance of more than two leḍḍupātas—approximately 36 meters. (A leḍḍupāta is a unit of measure that appears frequently in the Canon and is defined as the distance a man of average stature can throw a clod of dirt underarm.)

     - 《經分別》說，如果為了避免在邊境繳納進口關稅，而以逃避關稅區（§）的方式跨越邊境，則只會犯《突吉羅》。目前，民法認為這種行為比偷渡物品更應受到譴責，但從戒律的角度來看，仍應受到較輕的懲罰。《義註》稱，這項開緣僅適用於逃避海關區域距離超過 2 個 leḍḍupāta（約 36 公尺）的情況。（ *leḍḍupāta* 是一種在《聖典》中經常出現的測量單位，被定義為中等身材的人將一塊泥土用低手丟擲而出的距離。）

   * - The Vibhaṅga’s position here is important to understand, for it has implications concerning the extent to which the evasion of other government fees and taxes would fall under this rule. The underlying assumption here seems to be that a dutiable item carried into a customs area is impounded by the king (or government). The payment of the duty is thus an act of recovering full ownership of the item. An item carried across the frontier without entering the customs area would not count as impounded, even though the king would probably claim the right to impound or even confiscate it if his agents apprehended the smuggler. Translated into modern terms, this would indicate that the evasion of other taxes claimed by the government—such as inheritance taxes—would incur the full penalty here only if the item being taxed was impounded on government property, and one evaded the tax by taking the item out of impoundment without paying the required fee. Otherwise, the penalty for tax evasion would be a dukkaṭa.

     - 理解《經分別》在此的立場很重要，因為它涉及到逃避其他政府費用和稅收在多大程度上屬於此戒條的範圍。這裡的基本假設似乎是，帶入海關區域的應稅物品被國王（或政府）扣押。因此，繳納關稅是恢復該物品的全部所有權的行為。未進入海關區域而跨越邊境的物品不會被視為被扣押，儘管如果國王的特工逮捕了走私者，國王可能會聲稱有權扣押甚至沒收該物品。用現代術語來說，這表明，逃避政府徵收的其他稅款（例如遺產稅），只有當徵稅物品被扣押在政府財產上，並且在未繳納規定費用的情況下將物品從扣押中取出來逃稅時，才會受到全額懲罰。否則，對逃稅的懲罰是《突吉羅》。

   * - None of the texts discuss the question of contraband, i.e., articles that a customs official would confiscate outright rather than allow into a country after the payment of a fee. Apparently, such goods smuggled through a customs house would fall into this category, although—as even the payment of a fee would not legally get them through customs—their selling value would be the determining factor in calculating the seriousness of the offense.

     - 這些文本都沒有討論違禁品問題，即海關官員在支付費用後會直接沒收而不是允許入境的物品。顯然，透過海關走私，即使支付費用也不能合法地通過海關的貨物屬於這一類，而它們的售價將成為計算犯戒嚴重性的決定性因素。

   * - *c. Malfeasance:* The Vinīta-vatthu includes an unusual case in which a wealthy man with two heirs—a son and a nephew—tells Ven. Ajjuka, “When I am gone, show the place (where my treasure is buried) (§) to whichever of my heirs has the greater faith.” After the man’s death, Ven. Ajjuka sees that the nephew has the greater faith and so shows the place of the treasure to him. The nephew awards the Saṅgha with a large donation; the son accuses Ven. Ajjuka of having wrongfully deprived him of his rightful inheritance. On hearing this, Ven. Ānanda first accuses Ven. Ajjuka of a pārājika, but when the wealthy man’s wishes are revealed, Ven. Upāli convinces Ven. Ānanda that Ven. Ajjuka committed no offense.

     - *c. 瀆職：*\ 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》包括一個\ `不尋常的案例`_\ ，其中一位有兩個繼承人（一個兒子和一個侄子）的富人告訴阿酬尊者，“當我離開後，請向我的繼承人中有較大信心者，展示那個地方（埋藏我的寶藏的地方）（§）。” 男子死後，阿酬尊者見侄子信心較大，便向他展示了寶藏所在。姪子給僧團一大筆布施；兒子指責阿酬尊者錯誤地剝奪了他的合法繼承權。聞言，阿難尊者首先指責阿酬尊者犯《波羅夷》，但當富人的願望被揭露時，優波離尊者說服了阿難尊者，阿酬尊者沒有犯戒。

   * - None of the texts discuss the details of this case, which seems to have postdated the Buddha’s parinibbāna. The apparent assumption underlying the ruling is that when X dies, the inheritance he leaves to Y belongs to Y from the moment of X’s death. Otherwise, the items in question would be ownerless until apportioned out among the heirs, and thus would not fulfill the factor of object under this rule. Also, the taking in this case would be accomplished in line with the Vibhaṅga’s standard definition for *taking* with regard to the objects involved—and not necessarily when the cheated heir gives up trying to reclaim the inheritance—for in Ven. Ajjuka’s case Ven. Ānanda was ready to impose a pārājika even though the son had not abandoned his claim.

     - 沒有任何文本討論這個案例的細節，這似乎是在佛陀般涅槃之後發生的。該裁決背後的明顯假設是，當 X 死亡時，他留給 Y 的遺產從 X 死亡那一刻起就屬於 Y。否則，相關物品在分配給繼承人之前將是無主的，因此不符合本戒條下的對象因素。此外，在這種情況下，「拿取」將按照《經分別》對所涉及對象的\ *拿取*\ 標準定義來完成－而不一定是當被欺騙的繼承人放棄試圖收回遺產時－因為在阿酬尊者的案例中，儘管兒子並沒有放棄聲稱擁有，阿難尊者已經準備好施加《波羅夷》了。

   * - *d. Destruction of property:* The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu breaks, scatters, burns, or otherwise renders unusable the property of another person, he incurs a dukkaṭa. Thus the simple destruction of property does not fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu intends to steal some grass belonging to the Community but ends up setting fire to it instead, thus incurring a dukkaṭa. The Commentary notes that this ruling applies only because the bhikkhu did not move the grass from its place. What this means is that if he had first taken the grass from its place and then destroyed it in any way, the factor of effort under this rule would have been fulfilled and—all other factors of a pārājika offense being present—he would have been guilty of the full offense.

     - *d. 毀損財物：*\ 《經分別》說，如果比丘破壞、散落、焚燒或以其他方式使他人的財產無法使用，他犯《突吉羅》。因此，單純地破壞財產並不能滿足此戒條下的努力因素。《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中記載了一個案例，一名比丘打算偷一些屬於僧團的草，但結果卻放火燒了它，從而犯《突吉羅》。《義註》指出，這項裁決適用僅因比丘沒有將草移離原處的情況。這意味著，如果他首先將草從原處上拿走，然後以任何方式摧毀它，則此戒條下的努力因素將被滿足，並且－《波羅夷》違犯的所有其他因素都存在－他將完全違犯此戒。

   * - Special cases cited in the Commentary include the following:
     - 《義註》中引用的特殊案例包括：

   * - *a. False dealing:* A bhikkhu makes counterfeit money or uses counterfeit weights. The taking is accomplished when the counterfeit is accepted. This case, however, would seem to fall under the category of Deceit (see below), in that the counterfeit is a form of a lie. If the owner of an object accepts the counterfeit and hands over an object in return, the object cannot be described as stolen. However, the object obtained in trade in this way would have to be forfeited under `NP 20`_, and the Community, if it felt so inclined, could impose a disciplinary transaction on the offender (see `BMC2, Chapter 20`_).

     - *a. 虛假交易：*\ 比丘製造偽鈔或使用偽造砝碼。當偽造品被接受時，「拿取」就完成了。然而，本情況似乎屬於\ **欺詐**\ 類別（見下文），因為偽造品是謊言的一種形式。如果物品的所有者接受了偽造品並交出物品作為回報，則該物品不能被描述為被偷竊。然而，根據\ `《捨墮》二十`_\ ，以這種方式透過交易獲得的物品必須被捨出，並且如果僧團願意的話，可以對違犯者實施治罪羯磨（參見\ `《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章`_\ ）。

   * - *b. Robbery:* Using threats, a bhikkhu compels the owner of an object to give it to him. The taking is accomplished when the owner complies. This would not count as giving because the owner is not giving the item willingly.

     - *b. 搶劫：*\ 比丘利用威脅，強迫物品的所有者將物品交給他。當所有者服從時，「拿取」即告完成。這不算是給予，因為物品的所有者並不是自願給予的。

   * - *c. Concealing:* A bhikkhu finds an object left on the ground and, to deceive the owner, covers it with dirt or leaves with the intent of stealing it later. If the owner, after searching for the item, temporarily abandons the search and the bhikkhu then picks it up, it is stolen when removed from its base. If the owner, deciding that the item is lost, abandons it for good before the bhikkhu picks it up, the Commentary says that the bhikkhu is not guilty of theft but owes the owner compensation. We have discussed the topic of lost items above, under Object, and will discuss the topic of compensation below.

     - *c. 隱藏：*\ 比丘發現地上有物品，為了欺騙所有者，用泥土或樹葉覆蓋它，意圖稍後偷走它。如果所有者在搜尋該物品後，暫時放棄搜尋，然後比丘撿起它，那麼當它從底座上移除時，它就算被偷走。如果所有者認定物品遺失，在比丘取走物品之前將其永久遺棄，《義註》說，比丘沒有犯偷竊戒，但應賠償所有者。我們已經在上面的「對象」章節下，討論了遺失物品的議題，並將在下面討論賠償的議題。

   * - **The value of the object**
     - **對象的價值**

   * - As stated above, any case of stealing counts as an offense, but the gravity of the offense is determined by the value of the object. This is the point of the phrase in the rule reading, “just as when there is the taking of what is not given, kings… would banish him, saying… ‘You are a thief.’” In other words, for a theft to entail a pārājika it must be a criminal case, which in the time of the Buddha meant that the goods involved were worth at least five *māsakas*, a unit of money used at the time. Goods valued collectively at more than one māsaka but less than five are grounds for a thullaccaya; goods valued collectively at one māsaka or less, grounds for a dukkaṭa. As the Commentary notes, the value of the articles is determined by the price they would have fetched at the time and place of the theft. As stated above, in the case of smuggling the Vibhaṅga measures the value of the object, for the purpose of this rule, as the duty owed on it, not the value of the object itself.

     - 如上所述，任何偷竊行為都被視為犯戒，但犯戒的嚴重程度取決於對象物品的價值。這就是戒條中這句話的要點，「就像當有人拿取未給予的東西時，國王......會驅逐他，說......『你是一個小偷。』」換句話說，竊盜行為涉及《波羅夷》的，一定是刑事犯罪案件，在佛陀時代，這意味著所涉及的貨物至少價值 5 *摩沙迦*\ （當時使用的貨幣單位）。總價值超過 1 摩沙迦但低於 5 摩沙迦的商品，犯《偷蘭遮》；總價值為 1 摩沙迦或更低的商品，犯《突吉羅》。正如《義註》指出的那樣，物品的價值取決於它們在被偷的時間和地點的售價。如上所述，在走私的情況下，就本戒條而言，《經分別》是以對其所徵收的關稅作為物品的價值，而不是物品本身的價值。

   * - This leaves us with the question of how a māsaka would translate into current monetary rates. No one can answer this question with any certainty, for the oldest attempt to peg the māsaka to the gold standard dates from the V/Sub-commentary, which sets one māsaka as equal to 4 rice grains’ weight of gold. At this rate, the theft of an item worth 20 rice grains’ (1/24 troy ounce) weight of gold or more would be a pārājika offense.

     - 這給我們留下了一個問題：摩沙迦如何轉換為當前的貨幣利率。沒有人能夠肯定地回答這個問題，因為將摩沙迦與金本位掛鉤的最古老的嘗試可以追溯到V/《複註》，其中將 1 摩沙迦等於 4 粒米重的黃金。按照這個利率，偷竊價值 20 粒米（1/24 `金衡盎司`_\ ）黃金或更高將構成《波羅夷》罪。

   * - One objection to this method of calculation is that some of the items mentioned in the Vinīta-vatthu as grounds for a pārājika when stolen—e.g., a pillow, a bundle of laundry, a raft, a handful of rice during a famine—would seem to be worth much less than 1/24 troy ounce of gold. However, we must remember that many items regarded as commonplace now may have been viewed as expensive luxuries at the time.

     - 對這種計算方法的一個反對意見是，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中提到的一些被偷時作為《波羅夷》依據的物品——例如，一個枕頭、一捆衣物、一艘木筏、飢荒期間的一把米——其價值似乎遠低於 1/24 金衡盎司黃金。然而，我們必須記住，許多現在被認為司空見慣的物品在當時可能被視為昂貴的奢侈品。

   * - In addition, there is one very good reason for adopting the standard set by the V/Sub-commentary: It sets a high value for the least article whose theft would result in a pārājika. Thus when a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, there can be no doubt that he has committed the full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be inescapable doubt—and when there is any doubt concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt: He is not expelled. A basic principle operating throughout the texts is that it is better to risk letting an offender go unpunished than to risk punishing an innocent bhikkhu.

     - 此外，採用V/《複註》設定的標準還有一個很好的理由：它為偷竊會導致《波羅夷》的最少物品設定了很高的價值。因此，當比丘偷竊價值 1/24 金衡盎司黃金或更高的物品時，毫無疑問他已經完全違犯此戒。當物品的價值較低時，就會不可避免地產生懷疑——當對《波羅夷》有任何疑問時，戒律的傳統始終給予比丘以懷疑的好處：他不會被驅逐。貫穿整個文本的一個基本原則是，冒著讓犯戒者不受懲罰的風險，比冒著懲罰無辜比丘的風險要好。

   * - There is a second advantage to the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation: its precision and clarity. Some people have recommended adopting the standard expressed in the rule itself—that if the theft would result in flogging, imprisonment, or banishment by the authorities in that time and at that place, then the theft would constitute a pārājika—but this standard creates more problems than it would solve. In most countries the sentence is largely at the discretion of the judge or magistrate, and the factor of value is only one among many taken into account when determining the penalty. This opens a whole Pandora’s box of issues, many of which have nothing to do with the bhikkhu or the object he has taken—the judge’s mood, his social philosophy, his religious background, and so forth—issues that the Buddha never allowed to enter into the consideration of how to determine the penalty for a theft.

     - V/《複註》的計算方法還有第二個優點：精確、清晰。有些人建議採用戒條本身所表達的標準，即如果偷竊行為會導致當時該地點的當局鞭打、監禁或流放，那麼該偷竊行為就構成《波羅夷》，但這一標準產生的問題多於其解決的問題。在大多數國家，刑罰很大程度上由法官或治安官酌情決定，價值因素只是決定刑罰時考慮的眾多因素之一。這就打開了整個潘朵拉魔盒的問題，其中許多問題與比丘或他所拿取的對象物品無關——法官的情緒、他的社會哲學、他的宗教背景等等——佛陀從未允許在對竊盜罪的刑罰如何確定時考慮的問題。

   * - Thus the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation has the benefits that it is a quick and easy method for determining the boundaries between the different levels of offense in any modern currency; it involves no factors extraneous to the tradition of the Vinaya, and—as noted above—it draws the line at a value above which there can be no doubt that the penalty is a pārājika.

     - 因此，V/《複註》的計算方法的優點是，它是一種快速、簡單的方法，可以確定任何現代貨幣的不同犯戒程度之間的界限；它不涉及與戒律傳統無關的因素，而且——如上所述——它劃定了一個價值，高於這個價值，毫無疑問，懲罰就是《波羅夷》。

   * - The Commentary, arguing from two cases in the Vinīta-vatthu, states that if a bhikkhu steals several items on different occasions, the values of the different items are added together to determine the severity of the offense *only if they were stolen as part of a single plan or intention.* If they are stolen as a result of separate intentions, each act of stealing is treated as a separate offense whose severity depends on the value of the individual item(s) stolen in that act. This point is best explained with examples:

     - 《義註》根據《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中的兩個案例進行論證，指出如果比丘在不同場合偷竊了幾件物品，\ *則只有當這些物品屬於單一計劃或意圖的一部分被偷竊時，*\ 才將不同物品的價值加在一起以確定犯戒的嚴重程度。如果它們是因不同意圖而被偷竊，則每次偷竊行為均被視為單獨的犯戒行為，其嚴重程度取決於該行為中被偷竊的個別物品的價值。這一點最好用例子來解釋：

   * - In one of the Vinīta-vatthu cases, a bhikkhu steals ghee from a jar “little by little.” This, according to the Commentary, means that first he decides to steal a spoonful of ghee from a jar. After swallowing the spoonful, he decides to steal one more. After that he decides to steal another, and so on until he has finished the jar. Because each spoonful was stolen as a consequence of a separate plan or intention, he incurs several dukkaṭas, each for the theft of one spoonful of ghee.

     - 在一個《Vinīta_-vatthu_》案件中，一位比丘「一點一點地」從罐子裡偷竊酥油。根據《義註》，這意味著他首先決定從罐子裡偷一匙酥油。吞下一匙後，他決定再偷一匙。之後他決定再偷一個，依此類推，直到他吃完這個罐子。由於每匙酥油都是因單獨的計劃或意圖而被偷竊，他犯了數次《突吉羅》，因偷竊每一匙酥油而犯一次《突吉羅》。

   * - If, however, he decides at one point to steal enough lumber to build himself a hut and then steals a plank from here and a rafter from there, taking lumber over many days at different places from various owners, he commits one offense in accordance with the total value of all the lumber stolen, inasmuch as he took all the pieces of wood as a consequence of one prior plan.

     - 然而，如果他在某一時刻決定偷足夠的木材來為自己建造一座小屋，然後從這裡偷一塊木板，從那裡偷一根椽子，並在許多天內從不同的所有者那裡獲取木材，那麼他就根據所有被盜木材的總價值犯了戒，因為他根據先前的計劃拿走了所有木材。

   * - **Derived offenses**
     - **衍生違犯**

   * - In addition to the lesser offenses related to the value of the object, the Vibhaṅga also lists lesser offenses related to two factors of the full offense under this rule: effort and perception.

     - 除了與物品的價值相關的較輕的犯戒之外，《經分別》還列出了與此戒條下的完全違犯的兩個因素相關的較輕的犯戒：努力和感知。

   * - With regard to effort, the Vibhaṅga states that the derived offenses begin when one walks toward the object with the intent of stealing it, with each separate act—and in the case of walking toward the object, each step—incurring a dukkaṭa, up to a point just prior to the actual stealing where the offenses turn into thullaccayas. Where this point occurs depends on the act constituting the actual taking, as follows:

     - 關於努力，《經分別》指出，當一個人帶著偷竊的意圖走向該物品時，衍生的犯戒就開始了，每一個單獨的行為——在走向該物品的情況下，每一步——都會犯一次《突吉羅》，直到在實際偷竊之前的那一時刻，犯戒行為變成了《偷蘭遮》。這一時刻的發生點取決於構成實際「拿取」的行為，如下：

   * - *Moving the object from its place:* all steps up through touching the object: dukkaṭas. Making the object budge without fully moving it from its place: a thullaccaya.

     - *將物品從原來的位置移動：*\ 直到觸摸物品的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使物品移動而不將其完全移離其位置：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *“Cutting off” a fistful:* all steps up through touching the object: dukkaṭas. Making the object budge without fully cutting off a fistful: a thullaccaya.

     - *「切掉」一把：*\ 直到觸摸物品的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使物品移動而不完全切掉一把：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Sticking a vessel into a pool of liquid or pile of objects and causing some of the pool or pile to enter the vessel:* all steps up through touching the pool or pile: dukkaṭas. Making the pool or pile budge without fully getting five māsakas worth separated from the pool or pile and inside the vessel: a thullaccaya.

     - *將器皿插入一池液體或一堆物體中，並使一池液體或一堆物體中的一些進入器皿：*\ 直到接觸該池或該堆的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使該池或該堆移動，而沒有完全將價值 5 摩沙迦從該池或該堆分離出來並進入器皿內：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Removing entirely from the mouth of a container:* all steps up through touching the object: dukkaṭas. Lifting the object: a thullaccaya. Bringing it up to the level of the mouth of the container: another thullaccaya.

     - *完全從容器口中取出：*\ 直到接觸物品的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。舉起物品：《偷蘭遮》。將其提升到容器口的高度：另一個《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Drinking liquid from a container:* all steps up through drinking one māsaka worth of liquid as part of one prior plan (§): dukkaṭas. Drinking between one and five māsakas’ worth of liquid: a thullaccaya.

     - *從容器中飲用液體：*\ 作為先前計劃的一部分，直到飲用價值 1 摩沙迦的液體的所有步驟 (§)：《突吉羅》。飲用價值 1 到 5 摩沙迦的液體：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Moving the object from one part of one’s body to another or dropping it:* all steps up through touching the object with the intent to move it or drop it: dukkaṭas. Moving it but not to the point of putting it on another part of the body or dropping it: a thullaccaya.

     - *將物體從身體的一個部分移動到另一個部分或將其掉落：*\ 意圖移動或放下物體，直到觸摸它的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。移動它，但還不到將其放在身體的其他部位或將其掉落：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Causing a boat to move a hair-breadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water:* all steps up through loosening the moorings and/or touching it: dukkaṭas. Making the boat rock without causing it to move a hair-breadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water: a thullaccaya.

     - *讓船隻向上游、下游或穿過水體移動毫髮寬度：*\ 鬆開繫泊裝置和/或接觸它之前的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使船搖晃而不使其向上游、下游或穿過水體移動毫髮寬度：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Breaking an embankment so that water flows out:* all steps up through breaking the embankment and letting up to one māsaka’s worth of water flow out: dukkaṭas. Letting between one and five māsakas’ worth of water flow out: a thullaccaya.

     - *破壞堤防使水流出：*\ 破壞堤防，讓價值 1 摩沙迦的水流出之前的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。讓價值 1 到 5 摩沙迦的水流出來：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Causing an animal to move all its feet:* all steps up through touching the animal: dukkaṭas. Getting it to move any of its feet prior to its moving its last foot: a thullaccaya for each step.

     - *使動物移動其所有的腳：*\ 直到接觸動物的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。讓它在移動最後一隻腳之前先移動任何一隻腳：每一步都是一次《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Cutting down:* all steps prior to the next to the last chop needed to cut the plant through: dukkaṭas. The next to the last chop: a thullaccaya.

     - *砍伐：*\ 在最後一次劈砍之前將植物砍斷所需的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。緊接著最後一次劈砍：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Causing the owner to give up efforts (§) to regain possession of objects handed to one for safe keeping:* all steps up through telling the owner, “I didn’t receive (§) it”: dukkaṭas. Inducing doubt in the owner’s mind as to whether he/she will get the object back: a thullaccaya. If the case goes to court and the bhikkhu loses, he incurs another thullaccaya.

     - *導致所有者放棄重新擁有交給某人保管的物品的努力（§）：*\ 所有步驟直到告訴所有者“我沒有收到（§）它”：《突吉羅》。使所有者懷疑他/她是否會拿回物品：《偷蘭遮》。如果案件告上法庭而比丘敗訴，他就會再犯一次《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Causing the owner to give up efforts (§) to regain possession of land:* all steps up to laying claim to the land: dukkaṭas. Inducing doubt in the owner’s mind as to whether he/she will lose the land: a thullaccaya. Again, if the case goes to court and the bhikkhu loses, he incurs another thullaccaya.

     - *導致所有者放棄重新擁有土地的努力（§）：*\ 直到聲稱土地所有權的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使所有者懷疑他/她是否會失去土地：《偷蘭遮》。再者，如果案件告上法庭而比丘敗訴，他就會再犯一次《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Shifting a boundary marker:* all steps up through removing the boundary marker from its original place: dukkaṭas. Any steps between that and putting the boundary marker in a new place: thullaccayas.

     - *移動界碑：*\ 直到將界碑從其原始位置移走的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。在移走和將界碑放置在新位置之間的任何步驟：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - *Taking a dutiable item through a customs area without paying duty:* all steps up through touching the object with the intent of taking it out of the customs area: dukkaṭas. Making the object move without fully moving it from the customs area: a thullaccaya.

     - *帶應課稅物品通過海關區而不繳納關稅：*\ 直到觸摸該物品以將其帶出海關區的所有步驟：《突吉羅》。使物品移動而不將其完全移出海關區域：《偷蘭遮》。

   * - The commentaries state that when a heavier penalty is incurred in offenses of this sort, only that penalty is counted, and the preceding lighter ones are nullified. They derive this principle from a passage in the Vibhaṅga to `Sg 10-13`_ and, using the Great Standards, apply it to all the rules. Thus, for example, if a bhikkhu trying to steal a book simply touches it, he incurs a string of dukkaṭas for each step in walking up to the book and taking hold of it. If he budges the book slightly but not so much as to move it completely from its place, the dukkaṭas are nullified and replaced with a thullaccaya. If he actually takes the book, that nullifies the thullaccaya and replaces it with a pārājika.

     - 註釋指出，此類犯戒僅計算受到的較重懲罰，之前較輕的懲罰無效。他們從\ `《僧殘》十到十三`_\ 的《經分別》中的一段經文中得出這一原則，並使用《四大教示》，將其應用於所有戒條。因此，舉例來說，如果一個比丘試圖偷一本書，僅僅只是觸碰它，那麼他走到這本書並抓住它的每一步，犯一連串《突吉羅》。如果他稍微移動這本書，但又沒有完全移動它的位置，那麼《突吉羅》就會失效，並被《偷蘭遮》取代。如果他真的拿走了這本書，那麼《偷蘭遮》就會失效，並以《波羅夷》取而代之。

   * - There is some question, though, as to whether the compilers of the Canon intended the passage under `Sg 10-13`_ to be taken as a general principle. They don’t mention it under any of the other saṅghādisesa rules or in the otherwise parallel passage in the Vibhaṅga to `Pc 68`_. Thus, the principle seems intended only for those four rules. To be on the strict side, it seems best to say that, unless otherwise noted, a bhikkhu who completes an act must make amends for all the offenses incurred in leading up to it. Under the pārājika rules this is a moot point, for once the pārājika is committed the offender is no longer a bhikkhu. But under the lesser rules this principle is still relevant.

     - 然而，關於《聖典》的編撰者是否打算將\ `《僧殘》十到十三`_\ 中的段落視為一般原則，存在一些疑問。他們沒有在任何其他《僧殘》戒條下或在\ `《波逸提》六八`_\ 的《經分別》其他類似的段落中提及它。因此，該原則似乎僅適用於這四個戒條。從嚴格的角度來看，最好的說法是，除非另有說明，完成某一行為的比丘必須彌補在該行為之前所造成的所有罪過。根據《波羅夷》戒條，這是一個有爭議的問題，因為一旦犯了《波羅夷》，犯戒者就不再是比丘了。但在較小的戒條下，這項原則仍然適用。

   * - As for the derived offenses related to the factor of perception, these deal with the situation in which an article does not qualify as not given under this rule—e.g., it has no owner, or the owner has given it up or thrown it away—and yet the bhikkhu perceives it as not given. If he takes it with intent to steal, he incurs a dukkaṭa for each of the three stages of effort. In the case of an object that can be stolen by moving it from its place, these would be: touching the object, making it budge, moving it from its place. A similar set of offenses would apply in the stages appropriate for taking any of the other types of objects listed above.

     - 至於與感知因素有關的衍生違犯，這些涉及的是不符合本戒條規定的物品的情況，例如，該物品沒有所有者，或者所有者已將其放棄或扔掉——然而比丘認為它沒有被給予。如果他出於偷竊的目的而取走它，他會因三個階段中每一階段的努力而犯一次《突吉羅》。如果物品可以透過將其從原來的位置移開而被偷，則這些階段將是：觸摸該物體，使其移動，將其移離原來的位置。類似的犯戒行為將適用於拿取上述任何其他類型物品的適當階段。

   * - **Accomplices**
     - **共犯**

   * - A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. The offenses involved in the acts leading up to the theft are as follows:
     - 比丘不僅自己偷竊物品，而且煽動他人偷竊，都可能犯戒。導致偷竊的行為所涉及的犯戒行為如下：

   * - If a bhikkhu tells an accomplice to take an object that would be grounds for a pārājika, he incurs a dukkaṭa. When the accomplice agrees to do so, the instigator incurs a thullaccaya. Once the accomplice succeeds in taking the object as instructed—regardless of whether he gets away with it, and of whether he shares it with the instigator—the instigator incurs a pārājika. If the accomplice is a bhikkhu, he too incurs a pārājika. If the object would be grounds for a thullaccaya or a dukkaṭa, the only penalties incurred prior to the actual theft would be dukkaṭas.

     - 如果比丘告訴共犯拿走一件可以當《波羅夷》根據的物體，他就會犯《突吉羅》。當共犯同意這樣做時，教唆者就會犯《偷蘭遮》。一旦共犯按照指示成功拿取了物品——無論他是否逃脫懲罰，也無論他是否與教唆者分享該物品——教唆者都會犯《波羅夷》。如果共犯是比丘，他也會犯《波羅夷》。如果該物品是《偷蘭遮》或《突吉羅》的根據，則在實際偷竊之前發生的唯一懲罰將是《突吉羅》。

   * - The Commentary insists that if the accomplice is sure to take the item, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika as soon as the accomplice agrees to take it. However, as the Vinaya-mukha notes, this contradicts the Canon, and there is no way to measure whether a proposed theft is a sure thing or not.

     - 《義註》堅持認為，如果共犯肯定會拿走該物品，那麼一旦共犯同意拿走該物品，比丘就會犯《波羅夷》。然而，正如《戒律入口》所指出的，這與《聖典》互相矛盾，並且無法衡量提議的偷竊是否是肯定的事情。

   * - If there is any confusion in carrying out the instructions—e.g., if the accomplice, instead of taking the object specified by the instigator, takes something else instead; or if he is told to take it in the afternoon but instead takes it in the morning—the instigator incurs only the penalties for proposing the theft and persuading the accomplice, and not the penalty for the theft itself. The same holds true if the instigator rescinds his order before the theft takes place, but the accomplice goes ahead and takes the object anyway.

     - 如果在執行指示時出現任何混亂，例如，如果共犯沒有拿走教唆者指定的物品，而是拿走了其他東西；或者如果他被告知在下午取走，而在早上取走，則教唆者僅因提出偷竊行為並說服共犯而受到懲罰，而不會因偷竊本身而受到懲罰。如果教唆者在偷竊發生前撤銷命令，但共犯卻繼續拿走物品，情況也是如此。

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, an instigator who wishes to call off the theft before it is carried out but who for one reason or another cannot get his message to the accomplice in time, incurs the full penalty for the completed theft.

     - 根據《經分別》，如果教唆者希望在偷竊行為實施之前取消偷竊行為，但由於某種原因無法及時向共犯傳達訊息，則將因已完成的偷竊行為而受到全額懲罰。

   * - The Commentary also adds that the factor of the thief’s perception does not affect the penalties. In other words, if Bhikkhu A tells Bhikkhu B to steal object X, and B takes Y, thinking it to be X, A is absolved of any responsibility for the theft. Conversely, if B takes X, thinking it to be Y, A is guilty of the theft.

     - 《義註》還補充說，偷竊者的感知因素並不影響懲罰。換句話說，如果比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 偷東西 X，而 B 認為 Y 是 X，就拿走了 Y，那麼 A 就免除了偷竊的任何責任。相反，如果 B 拿走了 X，並認為它是 Y，則 A 犯有偷竊罪。

   * - The Vibhaṅga also notes that if an instigator tells his accomplice to take an item when he (the instigator) makes a sign—such as winking (§) his eye, lifting his eyebrow, or lifting his head—he incurs a dukkaṭa in making this order, a thullaccaya if the accomplice agrees to do as told, and the full offense when the accomplice actually takes the item at the time of the sign. If the accomplice takes the item before or after the sign, though, the instigator incurs no offense. The Sub-commentary, noting that the signs mentioned in the Vibhaṅga are so fleeting that it would be impossible to take the item at the very moment of the sign, interprets this last statement as follows: If the accomplice starts trying to take the item right after the sign, then regardless of how much time that takes, it counts as “at the time of the sign.” Only if he makes an appreciable delay before attempting the theft does it count as “after the sign.”

     - 《經分別》還指出，如果教唆者告訴他的共犯在他（教唆者）做出示意動作時拿走一件物品——例如眨眼（§）、揚起眉毛或抬起頭——他會在做這個命令動作時犯《突吉羅》，如果共犯同意按照指示行事，則為《偷蘭遮》；如果共犯在示意動作時實際拿走了該物品，則構成完全犯戒。不過，如果共犯在示意動作之前或之後拿走物品，教唆者不犯戒。《複註》指出，《經分別》中提到的示意動作是如此短暫，以至於不可能在示意動作出現的那一刻拿走該物品，因此對最後的陳述解釋如下：如果共犯在示意動作之後開始試圖拿走該物品，無論花費多少時間，都算是「示意動作時」。只有當他在嘗試偷竊之前明顯延遲時，才算作「在示意動作之後」。

   * - We can extrapolate from this discussion and say that any physical gesture that, from the context of events, is intended and understood as an order to take an item, would count under the factor of effort here. This extrapolation will be useful when treating the unauthorized use of credit cards, below.

     - 我們可以從這個討論中推斷出，從事件的背景來看，任何意圖被理解為拿取某件物品的命令的肢體動作，都將算在此處的努力因素中。在處理下面未經授權的信用卡使用時，這種推論將很有用。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if there is a chain of command involving two or more bhikkhus (not counting the instigator)—for example, Bhikkhu A telling Bhikkhu B to tell Bhikkhu C to tell Bhikkhu D to commit the theft—then when D agrees to commit the theft, the instigator incurs a thullaccaya. Once D takes the object as instructed, all four incur the penalty coming from the theft. If there is any confusion in the chain of command—e.g., Bhikkhu B instead of telling C tells D directly—neither A nor C incurs the penalty for the theft itself. Bhikkhu A would incur a dukkaṭa for telling B, whereas C would incur no penalty at all.

     - 《經分別》指出，如果存在涉及兩個或更多比丘（不包括教唆者）的指揮鏈——例如，比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 告訴比丘 C 告訴比丘 D 實施偷竊——那麼當 D 同意實施偷竊時，教唆者犯《偷蘭遮》。一旦 D 依照指示取走物品，四人都會因偷竊而受到懲罰。如果指揮鏈中存在任何混亂，例如，比丘 B 沒有告訴 C，而是直接告訴 D，那麼 A 和 C 都不會因為偷竊本身而受到懲罰。比丘 A 會因告訴 B 而犯《突吉羅》，而 C 則不會受到任何懲罰。

   * - The Commentary notes that the instigator in any of these cases incurs the penalty only if he gives an explicit command to take the item (although this statement has to be qualified to include signs meant as commands, as mentioned above). If he simply tells his accomplice that such-and-such an item is located in such-and-such a place and would be easy to steal, he incurs no penalty even if the accomplice actually commits the theft. This point applies to many of the rules in which giving a command to do an action that would break the rule would also fulfill the factor of effort: A statement counts as a command only if it is a clear imperative to do the action. Under the few rules where this is *not* the case, we will note the exception.

     - 《義註》指出，在任何這些情況下，教唆者只有在明確命令拿走該物品時才會受到懲罰（儘管此陳述也包括意味著命令的示意動作，如上所述）。如果他只是告訴共犯，某某物品位於某某地方，很容易偷竊，即使共犯確實實施了偷竊行為，他也不會受到懲罰。這一點適用於許多戒條，在這些戒條中，發出命令執行違反戒條的行動也將滿足努力因素：只有當明確要求執行某項行動時，該語句才算是命令。在情況\ *並非*\ 如此的少數戒條，我們將註明例外情況。

   * - None of the texts mention the scenario in which Bhikkhu A tells Bhikkhu B to take an item for him without letting B know that he is committing a theft—for instance, telling B that the item belongs to him (A), that it is ownerless, or letting B come to either conclusion on his own. Nevertheless, it would appear that if B then actually takes the item as told, all of the factors for an offense would be fulfilled for A: He gives the command to take (the imperative the Vibhaṅga uses in illustrating commands to “steal”—\ *avahara*\ —can also simply mean to “take”), he knows that the item belongs to someone else, he intends to have it taken, and it is taken as a result of his command. As for B, he would not be committing an offense, as his state of mind would not fulfill the factors of perception and intention for a theft.

     - 沒有任何文本提到這樣的場景：比丘 A 告訴比丘 B 為他拿走一件物品，但不讓 B 知道他正在偷竊，例如，告訴 B 該物品屬於他（A），或它是無主的，或者讓 B 自己得出兩者中任一結論。然而，看起來如果 B 實際上按照所告知的那樣拿走了該物品，那麼 A 就滿足了所有犯戒因素：他發出了拿走的命令（《經分別》在解釋「偷竊」命令時使用的祈使語氣—— *avahara* ——也可以只表示「拿走」），他知道該物品屬於其他人，他打算拿走它，並且由於他的命令而被拿走。至於 B，他不犯戒，因為他的心理狀態不符合偷竊的感知和意圖因素。

   * - Cases of this sort would not fall under Deceit, discussed below, because that category covers only cases where one deceives the owner of the item, or his agent, into giving the item, and thus technically the item counts as given. Here the item is not given, for the person deceived into taking it is not responsible for it at all.

     - 此類案件不屬於下面討論的\ **欺詐**\ 行為，因為該類別僅涵蓋欺騙物品所有者或其代理人給予物品的情況，因此從技術上講，該物品算作已經給予了。這裡該物品並沒有被給予，因為被欺騙拿走該物品的人根本不為此負責。

   * - As with the extrapolation from the discussion of signs, this application of the Great Standards will also be useful when we discuss unauthorized use of credit cards, below. It will also prove useful in our discussion of the following rule.

     - 與從示意動作的討論中推斷一樣，當我們在下面討論未經授權使用信用卡時，《四大教示》的應用也將很有用。它在我們接下來的戒條討論中也證明是有用的。
