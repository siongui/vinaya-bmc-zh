   * - This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.

     - 根據《附隨》，這個術語源自於一個動詞，意思是「失去」或「被擊敗」。比丘若犯下列四條戒中的任何一種，就已經屈服於自己的心理煩惱，以致他違背了自己成為比丘的初衷。《經分別》中用許多比喻說明了這種擊敗的不可挽回的性質：「就像一個人的頭被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的葉子脫離了莖……就像一塊被碎成兩半的扁平石頭無法再拼湊起來……就像一棵被砍掉樹冠的\ `糖棕`_\ 無法進一步生長一樣。” 犯下任何這些戒的比丘不可挽回地從僧團生活中斷絕，並且不再被視為比丘。
