   * - This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.

     - 根據《附隨》，這個術語源自於一個動詞，意思是「失去」或「被擊敗」。比丘若犯下列四條戒中的任何一種，就已經屈服於自己的心理煩惱，以致他違背了自己成為比丘的初衷。《經分別》中用許多比喻說明了這種擊敗的不可挽回的性質：「就像一個人的頭被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的葉子脫離了莖……就像一塊被碎成兩半的扁平石頭無法再拼湊起來……就像一棵被砍掉樹冠的\ `糖棕`_\ 無法進一步生長一樣。” 犯下任何這些戒的比丘不可挽回地從僧團生活中斷絕，並且不再被視為比丘。

          *Should any bhikkhu—participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus, without having renounced the training, without having declared his weakness—engage in sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeated and no longer in affiliation.*

          *如果任何比丘——參加比丘的訓練和生活，沒有放棄訓練，沒有表明自己的弱點——進行性交，即使是與雌性動物，也是波羅夷，不共住。*

   * - As we noted in the Introduction, the first formulation of this rule followed on Ven. Sudinna’s having had sex with one of his former wives. His motives, by worldly standards, were relatively noble: He was complying with his parents’ desire that he provide them with an heir. However, in the incident leading to the second formulation of this rule—in which the Buddha added the phrase “even with a female animal”—the instigator’s motives were considerably less so.

     - 正如我們在\ `引言`_\ 中指出的，這條戒條的最初制定是在須提那尊者與他的前妻們之一發生了性關係。按照世俗的標準，他的動機相對崇高：他遵守父母的願望，為他們提供一個繼承人。然而，在導致第二次制定這條戒條的事件中——佛陀在其中添加了「即使是與雌性動物」這句話——犯戒者的動機卻遠非如此。

          “Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu living in the Great Wood at Vesālī, having befriended a monkey with food (§), engaged in sexual intercourse with it. Then, dressing (§) early in the morning and carrying his bowl and outer robe, the bhikkhu went into Vesālī for alms. A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§). The thought occurred to the bhikkhus, ‘Undoubtedly this bhikkhu is engaging in sexual intercourse with this monkey.’ So they hid off to one side.

          “Then the bhikkhu, having gone for alms in Vesālī, returned bringing almsfood. The monkey went up to him. The bhikkhu, having eaten a portion of the almsfood, gave a portion to the monkey. The monkey, having eaten the almsfood, offered its rear to the bhikkhu, and the bhikkhu engaged in sexual intercourse with it (§).

          “Then the bhikkhus said to the bhikkhu, ‘Hasn’t a training rule been formulated by the Blessed One? How can you engage in sexual intercourse with this monkey?’

          “‘It’s true, friends, that a training rule has been formulated by the Blessed One, but that’s with regard to a human female, not to a female animal.’”

          「當時，有一位比丘住在毘舍離大林裡，以食物與一隻猴子結交（§），並與它交合。然後，比丘一大早穿好衣服，帶著鉢和外衣，到毘舍離去托缽。眾多比丘巡行房舍，來到了該比丘的住處。猴子遠遠地看見他們來了，一見他們，就走到他們面前，搖著臀部，搖著尾巴，把臀部拱了出來，做了個淫相（§）。比丘們心想：「毫無疑問，這位比丘正在與這隻猴子交合。」於是他們躲到一邊。

          「然後，比丘在毘舍離托缽之後，帶著托缽食物回來了。猴子向他走來。比丘吃完一部分缽食後，將一部分給予猴子。猴子吃完缽食後，將它的屁股示現給比丘，比丘就與它交合（§）。

          「然後，諸比丘對該比丘說：『世尊不是制定了學處嗎？你怎麼能和這隻猴子交合呢？

          “‘朋友們，確實有一條學處是由世尊制定的，但那是針對人類女性，而不是針對雌性動物。’”

   * - The full offense here is composed of four factors: effort, object, knowledge, and consent.

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The term *sexual intercourse* refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (*passāva-magga*)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (*vacca-magga*); or the mouth (*mukha*). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using *magga* (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and *amagga* (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.

     - *性交*\ 一詞是指所有類型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（\ *passāva-magga*\ ），即女性的陰道或男性的陰莖）；肛門（\ *vacca-magga*\ ）；或嘴（\ *mukha*\ ）。《經分別》總結了這些孔穴的各種可能的組合，並得出結論：除了口對口的插入（在下面的衍生違犯中處理）之外，所有這些孔穴都滿足了這裡的努力因素。不幸的是，《經分別》的總結是用技術術語表達的，使用 *magga* （道）來表示生殖器或肛門，使用 *amagga* （非道）來表示嘴。《義註》在討論總結時，錯誤地將嘴也歸類為道，因此必須為「非道」發明一個不同的意義：與三道之一接壤的傷口。由於《義註》對這一點的討論是基於誤解，因此無需進一步追究。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.

     - 《經分別》指出，當在該戒條涵蓋的任何可能的組合中，一個器官進入另一個器官時，即使只是達到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表發生了性交。這意味著比丘進行性交、口交或肛交時，無論他扮演什麼角色，都隸屬於這條戒條。器官之間是否有覆蓋物（例如保險套）的問題不相干，比丘是主動參與還是被動參與，以及參與的任何一方是否達到性高潮的問題都是不相干的。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The full penalty under this rule applies to any voluntary sexual intercourse with a human being, a “non-human” being (a *yakkha*, *nāga*, or *peta*), or a common animal, whether female, male, neuter, or hermaphrodite.

     - 這條戒條下的全額懲罰適用於與人類、「非人類」（夜叉 *yakkha* 、龍 *nāga* 或鬼 *peta* ）或普通動物（無論是雌性、雄性、中性或雌雄同體）的任何自願性交。

   * - Performing sexual intercourse with a dead body—even a decapitated head—also entails the full penalty if the remains of the body are intact enough for the act to be accomplished.

     - 如果屍體的殘骸夠完整以完成性交，與屍體（即使是與被斬首的頭）進行性交也將受到全額懲罰。

   * - In addition, the Vinīta-vatthu lists two examples of “self-intercourse”: A bhikkhu with a supple back takes his penis into his mouth, and a bhikkhu with an unusually long penis inserts it into his anus. Both cases carry the full penalty.

     - 此外，《Vinīta_-vatthu_》還列舉了兩個「自我性交」的例子：一個背部柔軟的比丘將陰莖放入口中，一個陰莖異常長的比丘將其插入肛門。 兩種情況均需受到全額懲罰。

   * - **Knowledge & consent**
     - **知悉 & 同意**

   * - For sexual intercourse to count as an offense, the bhikkhu must know that it is happening and give his consent. Thus if he is sexually assaulted while asleep or otherwise unconscious and remains oblivious to what is happening, he incurs no penalty. If, however, he becomes conscious during the assault or was conscious right from the start, then whether he incurs a penalty depends on whether he gives his consent during any part of the act.

     - 將性交算做犯戒，比丘必須知道它正在發生並給予他的同意。因此，如果他在睡覺或失去知覺時遭到性侵犯，並且對發生的事情渾然不覺，他不會受到懲罰。然而，如果他在襲擊過程中變得清醒，或者從一開始就清醒了，那麼他是否受到懲罰取決於他在行為的任何部分是否表示同意。

   * - Strangely enough, neither the Canon nor the Commentary discusses the factor of consent in any detail, except to mention by way of passing that it can apply to the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out. From the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, it would appear that consent refers to a *mental* state of acquiescence, together with its physical or verbal expression. Mere physical compliance does not count, as there are cases where bhikkhus forced into intercourse comply physically but without consenting mentally and so are absolved of any offense. However, there is also a case in which a woman invites a bhikkhu to engage in sexual intercourse, saying that she will do all the work while he can avoid an offense by doing nothing. The bhikkhu does as she tells him to, but when the case comes to the Buddha’s attention, the Buddha imposes a pārājika on the act without even asking the bhikkhu whether he consented or not. The assumption is that complying with a request like this indicates consent, regardless of whether one makes any physical or verbal movement at all.

     - 奇怪的是，《聖典》和《義註》都沒有詳細討論同意因素，只是順便提到它可以適用於插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出的階段。從《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中的例子來看，同意看來是指一種默許的\ *心理*\ 狀態，連同其身體或言語表達。僅僅身體上的順從並不算數，因為在某些情況下，比丘被迫進行性交，但沒有心理上的同意，因此沒有犯任何戒。然而，也有一種情況，女人邀請比丘發生性行為，說她會做所有的工作，他什麼都不做就可以避免犯戒。比丘照她的吩咐去做，但當這件事引起佛陀的注意時，佛陀甚至沒有詢問比丘是否同意，就認定該行為犯《波羅夷》。前提是，遵守這樣的請求就表明同意，無論一個人是否做出任何身體或口頭動作。

   * - Taken together, these cases imply that if one is sexually assaulted, one is completely absolved from an offense only if (1) one does not give one’s mental consent at any time during the act or (2) one does feel mental consent during at least part of the act but puts up a struggle so as not to express that consent physically or verbally in any way. (As the Commentary notes, drawing a general principle from the Vinīta-vatthu to `Pr 2`_, mere mental consent without physical expression is not enough to count as a factor of an offense, for there is no offense simply in the arising of a thought or mental state.) If one puts up no struggle and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out, one incurs the full penalty. This would seem to be the basis for the Commentary’s warning in its discussion of the Vinīta-vatthu case in which a bhikkhu wakes up to find himself being sexually assaulted by a woman, gives her a kick, and sends her rolling. The warning: This is how a bhikkhu still subject to sensual lust should act if he wants to protect his state of mind.

     - 總而言之，這些案例意味著，如果一個人受到性侵犯，只有在以下情況下才可以完全免除犯戒：（1）一個人在行為過程中的任何時候都沒有心理上同意，或者（2）一個人至少在行為過程中的某部份確實感到心理上的同意，但奮力掙扎避免以任何方式透過身體或口頭表達同意。（如《義註》中所指出的，從\ `《波羅夷》二`_\ 的《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中得出一條一般原則，僅在心理上同意而沒有身體表達，不足以算作犯戒的一個因素，因為僅僅在想法或心理狀態中產生並不構成犯戒。）如果一個人沒有做出任何掙扎並感到精神上同意，即使只是在插入、完全插入、留在原處或拔出階段短暫地發生，也會受到全額懲罰。這似乎是《義註》在討論《Vinīta_-vatthu_》的例子時發出警告的基礎，在該案例中，一名比丘醒來，發現自己遭到一名女人的性侵犯，踢了她一腳，然後讓她滾出去。警告：如果一個比丘仍然受制於色欲，他想要保護他的心境，就應該這樣做。

   * - The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu with “impaired faculties”—one who feels neither pleasure nor pain during intercourse—engages in intercourse under the assumption that his impairment exempts him from the rule. The case is brought to the Buddha, who states, “Whether this worthless man did or didn’t feel [anything], it is a case involving defeat.” From this ruling it can be argued that a bhikkhu indulging in intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty even if he doesn’t feel pleasure in the course of the act.

     - 《Vinīta_-vatthu_》中記載了一個案例，一位「官能受損」的比丘——在性交時既感覺不到快樂也感覺不到痛苦——認為他的缺陷使他不受戒條約束而進行性交。這個案例被提交給佛陀，佛陀說：“無論這個愚癡人有沒有（任何）感覺，這都是一個《波羅夷》的案例。” 從這個裁決可以看出，一個比丘在密宗儀式中沉溺於性交，即使他在行為過程中沒有感到快樂，也會受到全額懲罰。
