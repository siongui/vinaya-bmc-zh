   * - *Material*
     - *材料*

   * - `Cv.V.8.2`_ allows two kinds of alms bowls: made either of clay or of iron. `Cv.V.9.1`_ forbids eleven: made either of wood, gold, silver, pearl, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, or copper. Using the Great Standards, the Council of Elders in Thailand has recently decided that stainless steel bowls are allowable—because, after all, they are steel—but aluminum bowls not, because they share some of the dangers of tin. In the time of the Buddha, clay bowls were the more common. At present, iron and steel bowls are.

     - `《小品》.五.8.2`_\ 允許使用兩種缽：用\ `黏土`_\ 或鐵製成。\ `《小品》.五.9.1`_\ 禁止十一種：由木材、金、銀、珍珠、綠柱石、水晶、青銅、玻璃、錫、鉛或銅製成。根據《四大教示》，泰國長老會最近決定允許使用不鏽鋼缽——因為畢竟它們是鋼製的——但不允許使用鋁製缽，因為它們具有錫的一些危險。佛陀時代，黏土缽（陶缽）較為普遍。目前則是鐵缽和不鏽鋼缽。

   * - *Size*
     - *尺寸*

   * - The Vibhaṅga contains a discussion of three proper sizes for a bowl—the medium size containing twice the volume of the small, and the large twice the volume of the medium—but they are based on measurements that are not known with any precision at present. The author of the Vinaya-mukha reports having experimented with various sizes of bowls based on a passage in the story of Meṇḍaka in the Dhammapada Commentary. His conclusion: A small bowl is just a little larger than a human skull, and a medium bowl approximately 27 1/2 English inches (70 cm.) in circumference, or about 8.75 inches (22.5 cm.) in diameter. He did not try making a large bowl. Any size larger than the large size or smaller than the small is inappropriate; any size between them falls under this rule.

     - 《經分別》討論了缽的三種適當尺寸——中號缽的體積是小號缽的兩倍，大號缽的體積是中號缽的兩倍——但它們所基於的測量結果目前還沒有已知的任何精確度。《戒律入口》的作者報告說，他根據《法句經》《義註》中 Meṇḍaka 故事的一個段落，嘗試了各種尺寸的缽。他的結論是：小缽只比人的頭骨大一點，中缽的周長約為 27 又 1/2 英寸（70 公分），直徑約為 8.75 英寸（22.5 公分）。他沒有嘗試做一個大缽。任何大於大號或小於小號的尺寸都是不合適的；它們之間的任何大小都屬於符合本戒條。

   * - *Fully paid for*
     - *已全額付款*

   * - According to the Commentary, if a bowl-maker makes a gift of a bowl, it counts as fully paid for. If a bowl has been delivered to a bhikkhu but has yet to be fully paid for, it may not be determined and does not come under this rule until paid for in full.

     - 根據《義註》，如果制缽者製作了一個缽作為布施，則視為已全額付款。如果缽已交付給比丘但尚未全額付款，則在全額付款之前，它不可被決意，並且不屬於本戒條範疇。

   * - *Fired*
     - *燻燒*

   * - The Commentary states that a clay bowl must be fired twice before it can be determined, to make sure it is properly hardened; and an iron bowl five times, to prevent it from rusting. Because stainless steel does not rust it need not be fired, but a popular practice is to find some way to make it gray—either by painting it on the outside or firing the whole bowl with leaves that will give it a smoky color—so that it will not stand out.

     - 《義註》指出，黏土缽（陶缽）必須燒製兩次才能決意，以確保其適當硬化；鐵缽五次，防止生鏽。因為不銹鋼不會生鏽，所以不需要燒製，但一種流行的做法是找到某種方法使其變灰色——若非在外面塗漆，不然就是用葉子燒製整個缽，使其呈現煙燻色——這樣它就不會顯眼突出。

   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - *Not damaged beyond repair*
     - *未出現無法修復的損壞*

   * - The Vibhaṅga to the following rule says that a bhikkhu may ask for a new bowl if his current bowl has five mends or more, the space for a mend (§) being two inches (fingerbreadths). The Commentary explains this first by saying that a bowl with five mends or more is damaged beyond repair, and thus loses its determination as a bowl. It then expands on the Vibhaṅga’s statements as follows: A clay bowl is damaged beyond repair if it has at least ten inches of cracks in it, the smallest of the cracks being at least two inches long. Cracks less than two inches long are said not to merit mending—this is the meaning of the Vibhaṅga’s phrase, “space for a mend”—and so do not count. As the K/Commentary notes, whether the cracks are actually mended is not an issue here. If a bowl has fewer cracks than that, they should be mended either with tin wire, sap (but for some reason not pure pine sap), or a mixture of sugar cane syrup and powdered stone. Other materials not to be used for repair are beeswax and sealing wax. If the total length of countable cracks equals ten inches or more, the bowl becomes a non-bowl, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one.

     - 下一條戒條的《經分別》指出，如果比丘目前的缽有五處修補或更多，則比丘可以要求一個新缽，而修補的空間（§）為兩英寸（指寬）。《義註》首先解釋說，缽修補五次以上，就已經損壞到無法修復的程度，從而失去了其決意為缽。然後，它對《經分別》的敘述進行了如下擴展：如果一個粘土缽（陶缽）上有至少十英寸的裂縫，其中最小的裂縫至少有兩英寸長，那麼它就被損壞到無法修復的程度。小於兩英寸長的裂縫據說不值得修補——這就是《經分別》的措辭「用來修補的空間」的含義——所以不算數。正如 K/《義註》所指出的，裂縫是否真正得到修補在此並不是問題。如果缽的裂縫比那少，則應使用錫絲、樹液（但由於某種原因不是純松樹液）或甘蔗糖漿和石粉的混合物來修補。其他不能用於修復的材料是蜂蠟和密封蠟。如果可數裂縫的總長度等於或超過十英寸，則該缽就不再是缽，主人有權要求換一個新的。

   * - As for iron and steel bowls, a hole in the bowl large enough to let a millet grain pass through is enough to make the determination lapse, but not enough to make the bowl a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should plug the hole—or have a blacksmith plug it—with powdered metal or a tiny metal plug polished smooth with the surface of the bowl and then re-determine the bowl for use.

     - 對於鐵缽、不銹鋼缽來說，缽上有一個足以讓一粒小米粒通過的孔，足以使決意失效，但不足以使該缽成為非缽。比丘應該用金屬粉末或與缽表面打磨光滑的小金屬塞塞住這個洞，或者請鐵匠塞住，然後重新決意缽來使用。

   * - If the hole is small enough to be plugged in this way, then no matter how many such holes there are in the bowl they do not make it a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should mend it and continue using it. If, however, there is even one hole so large that the metal used to plug it cannot be polished smooth with the surface of the rest of the bowl, the tiny crevices in the patch will collect food. This makes it unfit for use, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one to replace it.

     - 如果這個洞夠小，可以用這種方式堵住，那麼無論缽裡有多少個這樣的洞，都不會使它成為一個非缽。比丘應該修補它並繼續使用它。然而，即使只有一個孔太大，以至於用於堵塞它的金屬無法與缽其餘部分的表面拋光光滑，修補片上的微小縫隙就會積聚食物。這將導致其不適合使用，所有者有權要求更換新的。

   * - An extra alms bowl, according to the Vibhaṅga, is any that has not yet been determined for use or placed under shared ownership. Because a bhikkhu may have only one bowl determined for use at any one time, he should place any additional bowls he receives under shared ownership if he plans to keep them on hand. (The procedures for placing bowls under determination and shared ownership, and for rescinding their determination and shared ownership, are given in `Appendices IV`_ & V_.)

     - 根據《經分別》，額外的缽是指尚未決意使用或置於共享所有權之下的任何缽。因為比丘在任何時候只可以有一個缽決意使用，所以如果他打算將收到的任何額外的缽放在手邊，他應該將它們置於共享所有權之下。（將缽決意和置於共享所有權之下以及撤銷其決意和共享所有權的程序參見\ `附錄四`_\ 和\ `五`_\ 。）

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - According to the Commentary, once a bowl belonging to a bhikkhu fulfills all the requirements for a determinable bowl, he is responsible for it even if he has not yet received it into his keeping—in other words, the countdown on the time span begins. For example, if a blacksmith promises to make him a bowl and to send word when it is finished, the bhikkhu is responsible for the bowl as soon as he hears word from the blacksmith’s messenger that the bowl is ready, even if he has yet to receive it. If the blacksmith, prior to making the bowl, promises to send it when it is done, then the bhikkhu is not responsible for it until the blacksmith’s messenger brings it to him. (All of this assumes that the bowl is already fully paid for.)

     - 根據《義註》，一旦比丘擁有的缽滿足了可決意缽的所有要求，即使他還沒有收到它，他也要對它負責——換句話說，時間跨度開始倒數。例如，如果鐵匠答應為他製作一個缽，並在完成後通知他，一旦比丘聽到鐵匠的使者說缽已準備好，他就要對缽負責，即使他還沒有收到它。如果鐵匠在製作缽之前承諾完成後將其送出，那麼在鐵匠的使者將缽帶給比丘之前，比丘不對此負責。（所有這些都假設缽已經全額付款。）

   * - However, all of this runs contrary to the principle given at `Mv.V.13.13`_, in which the countdown for a robe’s time span (see `NP 1`_) does not begin until the robe reaches one’s hand. It would seem that the same principle should apply here.

     - 然而，所有這些都違背了\ `《大品》.五.13.13`_\ 中給出的原則，其中袈裟的時間跨度（參見\ `《捨墮》一`_\ ）的倒數計時直到袈裟到達手中時才開始。同樣的原則似乎也適用於此。

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that if within ten days after receiving a new bowl a bhikkhu does not determine it for use, place it under shared ownership, abandon it (give it or throw it away); and if the bowl is not lost, snatched away, damaged beyond repair, or taken on trust, then on the tenth dawnrise after receiving it he incurs the full penalty under this rule. If he then uses the bowl without having forfeited it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.

     - 《經分別》規定，如果比丘在收到新缽後十天內不決意它來使用，置於共享所有權之下，放棄它（給予或扔掉）；而且如果缽沒有遺失、被搶走、損壞到無法修復或被基於信任拿走，那麼在收到缽後的第十天黎明時，根據本戒條他將承擔全部懲罰。如果他隨後使用了缽而沒有捨出它，則懲罰是《突吉羅》。

   * - Perception is not a mitigating factor here. Even if the bhikkhu thinks that ten days have not passed when they have, or if he thinks that the bowl is damaged beyond repair or placed under shared ownership, etc., when it isn’t, he incurs the penalty all the same.

     - 在這裡，感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素。即使比丘認為十天還沒過，但實際上已經過十天了，或認為缽已損壞無法修復或置於共享所有權之下，但事實並非如此，他仍然會受到懲罰。

   * - The Vibhaṅga also states that, in the case of an extra bowl that has not been kept more than ten days, if one perceives it to have been kept more than ten days or if one is in doubt about it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa. As under `NP 1`_, this dukkaṭa is apparently for then *using* the bowl.

     - 《經分別》還規定，多餘的缽沒有保存超過十天，如果認為它已經保存了超過十天或有疑問，則懲罰是《突吉羅》。與\ `《捨墮》一`_\ 中一樣，這個《突吉羅》顯然是為了\ *使用*\ 缽。

   * - **Forfeiture & confession**
     - **捨出 & 懺罪**

   * - The procedures for forfeiture, confession, and return of the bowl are the same as under `NP 1`_. For the Pali formulae to use in forfeiting and returning the bowl, see `Appendix VI`_. As with the rules concerning robe-cloth, the bowl must be returned to the offender after he has confessed his offense. Not to return it entails a dukkaṭa. Once the bowl is returned, the ten-day countdown starts all over again.

     - 捨出、懺罪和返還缽的程序與\ `《捨墮》一`_\ 中的相同。捨出和歸還缽時使用的巴利語公式，請參閱\ `附錄六`_\ 。與有關袈裟布的戒條一樣，在犯戒者懺罪後，必須將缽歸還給犯戒者。不歸還它會犯《突吉羅》。一旦缽歸還後，十天倒數又重新開始。

     - **不犯**

   * - There is no offense if within ten days the bhikkhu determines the bowl for use, places it under shared ownership, or abandons it; or if the bowl is lost, destroyed, broken, or snatched away; or if someone else takes the bowl on trust. With regard to “destroyed” and “broken” here, the Commentary’s discussion indicates that these terms mean “damaged beyond repair,” as defined above.

     - 若比丘在十天內決意使用該缽、將其置於共享所有權之下，或將其放棄，並不犯戒；或者如果缽遺失、毀壞、破損或被搶走；或者如果其他人基於信任拿走缽。關於這裡的「毀壞」和「破損」，《義註》的討論表明這些術語的意思是「損壞到無法修復』，如同上文所定義。

   * - *Summary: Keeping an alms bowl for more than ten days without determining it for use or placing it under shared ownership is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：保留缽十天以上，而未決意使用或置於共享所有權之下，是《尼薩耆波逸提》（《捨墮》）罪。*

   * - .. container:: notification

          *Should any bhikkhu with an alms bowl having fewer than five mends ask for another new bowl, it is to be forfeited and confessed. The bowl is to be forfeited by the bhikkhu to the company of bhikkhus. That company of bhikkhus’ final bowl should be presented to the bhikkhu, (saying,) “This, bhikkhu, is your bowl. It is to be kept until broken.” This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘的缽少於五處修補，要求另一個新缽，尼薩耆波逸提。比丘應將缽捨出給比丘同伴。比丘同伴最後的缽應給比丘，（說：）「比丘，這是你的缽。必須保留它，直到損壞為止。」這於此是如法的。*

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time a certain potter had invited the bhikkhus, saying, ‘If any of the masters needs a bowl, I will supply him with a bowl.’ So the bhikkhus, knowing no moderation, asked for many bowls. Those with small bowls asked for large ones. Those with large ones asked for small ones. (§) The potter, making many bowls for the bhikkhus, could not make other goods for sale. (As a result,) he could not support himself, and his wife and children suffered.”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「\ `爾時，有一個陶匠邀請了比丘們 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0348a03>`_\ ，說：『如果哪位大德需要一個缽，我就供給他一個缽。』於是，比丘們毫無節制地要了很多缽。那些有小缽的人要求大缽。那些有大缽的要求小缽。（§）陶匠為比丘們製作了許多缽，無法製作其他物品來出售。（結果）他無法養活自己，他的妻子和孩子也受苦了。」

   * - Here the full offense involves three factors:
     - 這裡，完整的違犯涉及三個因素：

   * - *1) Effort:* Before one’s alms bowl is beyond repair, one asks for
     - *1）努力：*\在缽無法修復之前，要求

   * - *2) Object:* a new almsbowl fit to be determined for use.
     - *2）對象：*\一個適合決意使用的新缽。

   * - *3) Result:* One obtains the bowl.
     - *3）結果：*\獲得缽。

   * - According to the Commentary, the phrase, a bowl “having fewer than five mends” refers to one that is not beyond repair, as explained under the preceding rule. Thus this rule allows a bhikkhu whose bowl *is* beyond repair to ask for a new one.

     - 根據《義註》，該措辭，缽「少於五處修補」，是指未至不可修復的缽，如前述戒條所解釋。因此，本戒條允許比丘的缽\ *為*\ 無法修復時可以要求換一個新的。

   * - A bhikkhu whose bowl is not beyond repair incurs a dukkaṭa in asking for a new bowl, and a nissaggiya pācittiya in receiving it.
     - 當比丘的缽沒有無法修復時，會因索取新缽而犯《突吉羅》，並在接受新缽時犯《捨墮》。

.. list-table::
   :class: table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow stack-th-td-on-mobile
   :widths: auto

   * - **Forfeiture, confession, & bowl exchange**
     - **捨出、懺罪和交換缽**

   * - Once a bhikkhu has obtained a bowl in violation of this rule, he must forfeit it in the midst of the Community and confess the offense. (See `Appendix VI`_ for the Pali formulae used in forfeiture and confession.) He then receives the Community’s “final bowl” to use in place of the new one he has forfeited.

     - 一旦比丘違反本戒條獲得了缽，他必須在僧團中捨出它並懺悔罪行。（請參閱\ `附錄六`_\ ，用於捨出和懺罪的巴利語公式。）然後，他收到僧團的「最後缽」來使用，以代替他捨出的新缽。

   * - The Community’s final bowl is selected in the following way: Each bhikkhu coming to the meeting to witness the offender’s forfeiture and confession must bring the bowl he has determined for his own use. If a bhikkhu has an inferior bowl in his possession—either extra or placed under shared ownership—he is not to determine that bowl and take it to the meeting in hopes of getting a more valuable one in the exchange about to take place. To do so entails a dukkaṭa.

     - 僧團的最後缽是按下列方式選出的：每一位來參加集會見證犯戒者捨出和懺罪的比丘必須攜帶他已決意供自己使用的缽。如果比丘擁有一個較差的缽——無論是額外的還是置於共享所有權之下——他都不能決意該缽並將其帶到集會上，希望在即將舉行的交換中得到一個更有價值的缽。這樣做犯《突吉羅》。

   * - Once the bhikkhus have assembled, the offender forfeits his bowl and confesses the offense. The Community, following the pattern of a motion and one proclamation *(ñatti-dutiya-kamma)* given in `Appendix VI`_, then chooses one of its members as bowl exchanger. As with all Community officials, the bowl exchanger must be free of the four types of bias: based on desire, based on aversion, based on delusion, based on fear. He must also know when a bowl is properly exchanged and when it’s not. His duty, once authorized, is to take the forfeited bowl and show it to the most senior bhikkhu, who is to choose whichever of the two bowls pleases him more—his own or the new one. If the new bowl is preferable to his own and yet he does not take it out of sympathy for the offender, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The K/Commentary and Sub-commentary add that if he does not prefer the new bowl, there is no offense in not taking it. The Commentary states that if he does prefer the new bowl but, out of a desire to develop the virtue of contentment with what he has, decides not to take it, there is also no offense.

     - 一旦比丘們聚集在一起，犯戒者捨出他的缽並懺悔罪行。僧團按照\ `附錄六`_\ 中給出的一項動議和一項公告[譯註：一白與一羯磨] *(ñatti-dutiya-kamma [譯註：白二羯磨])* 的模式，選擇其中一名成員作為缽交換者。與所有僧團執事一樣，缽交換者必須擺脫四種類型的偏見：基於貪、基於嗔、基於癡、基於恐懼。他還必須知道何時正確交換缽，何時不正確。一旦獲得授權，他的職責就是將被捨出的缽拿給戒臘最高的比丘看，後者要選擇兩個缽中他更喜歡的一個——他自己的缽或新的缽。如果新缽比他自己的缽更好，但他出於對犯戒者的同情而沒有拿走它，他犯《突吉羅》。 K/《義註》和《複註》補充說，如果他不喜歡新缽，不接受它並沒有犯戒。《義註》指出，如果他確實喜歡新缽，出於培養滿足於自己所擁有的美德的願望，決定不接受它，也沒有犯戒。

   * - To continue with the Vibhaṅga: Once the most senior bhikkhu has taken his choice, the remaining bowl is then shown to the bhikkhu second in seniority, who repeats the process, and so on down the line to the most junior bhikkhu. The bowl exchanger then takes the bowl remaining from this last bhikkhu’s choice—the least desirable bowl belonging to that company of bhikkhus—and presents it to the offender, telling him to determine it for his use and to care for it as best he can until it is no longer useable.

     - 繼續講《經分別》：一旦戒臘最高的比丘做出了選擇，剩下的缽就會呈給戒臘第二高的比丘，重複這個過程，依此類推，依次遞給戒臘最低的比丘。然後，缽交換者將最後一位比丘選擇的剩餘缽——屬於比丘同伴們最不合意的缽——交給犯戒者，告訴他決意來使用並盡其所能地照料它，直到它不可用為止。

   * - If the offender treats it improperly—putting it in a place where it might get damaged, using it in the wrong sort of way (on both of these points, see `BMC2, Chapter 3`_)—or tries to get rid of it (§), thinking, “How can this bowl be lost or destroyed or broken,” he incurs a dukkaṭa.

     - 如果犯戒者對待它不當——將其放在可能損壞的地方，以錯誤的方式使用它（這兩點，請參閱\ `《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第三章`_\ ）——或試圖擺脫它（§），心想：「這個缽怎麼才會遺失、毀壞或破碎呢？」

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - A bhikkhu whose bowl is not beyond repair incurs no penalty if he asks for a new bowl from relatives or from people who have invited him to ask, or if he gets a new bowl with his own resources. He is also allowed to ask for a bowl for the sake of another, which—following the Commentary to `NP 6`_—would mean that Bhikkhu X may ask for a bowl for Y only if he asks from his own relatives or people who have invited him to ask for a bowl OR if he asks from Y’s relatives or people who have invited Y to ask. Asking for and receiving a bowl for Y from people other than these would entail the full offense.

     - 比丘的缽尚未無法修復時，如果他向親戚或邀請他的人索取新缽，或者用自己的資源得到新缽，則不會受到懲罰。他也被允許為另一個人要一個缽，這——根據\ `《捨墮》六`_\ 的《義註》——意味著比丘 X 只有在向自己的親戚或邀請他的人索取時，\ **或者**\ 向 Y 的親戚或邀請 Y 的人索取時，才可以為 Y 要一個缽。向這些人以外的人索取並為 Y 接受的缽將構成完全違犯。

   * - *Summary: Asking for and receiving a new alms bowl when one’s current bowl is not beyond repair is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：當現有的缽尚未無法修復時，索取並接受新的缽是《尼薩耆波逸提》（《捨墮》）罪。*

   * - The five tonics mentioned in this rule form one of four classes of edibles grouped according to the time period within which they may be eaten after being received. The other three—food, juice drinks, and medicines—are discussed in detail at the beginning of the `Food Chapter`_ in the pācittiya rules. Here is the story of how the tonics came to be a special class:

     - 本戒條中提到的五種補品屬於四類食品之一，根據收到後可以食用的時間段進行分組。其他三種——食物、果汁飲料和藥物——在《波逸提》戒條的\ `食物品`_\ 開頭詳細討論。以下是補品如何成為一類特殊類別的故事：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then as the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this line of reasoning occurred to his mind: ‘At present the bhikkhus, afflicted by the autumn disease, bring up the conjey they have drunk and the meals they have eaten. Because of this they are thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, their bodies covered with veins. What if I were to allow medicine for them that would be both medicine and agreed to be medicine by the world, and serve as food, yet would not be considered gross (substantial) food.’

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「當世尊獨自隱居時，他心中生起這樣的推理：『現在，諸比丘，受秋病之苦，嘔吐出他們所喝的粥和所吃的飯菜。因此，他們瘦弱、可憐、毫無吸引力、臉色蒼白，全身佈滿青筋。如果我允許為他們提供藥物，這種藥物既是藥物，又被世人認為是藥物，又可以作為食物，但又不會被視為粗劣（大量）食物。」

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then this thought occurred to him: ‘There are these five tonics—ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, sugar/molasses—that are both medicine and agreed to be medicine by the world, and serve as food yet would not be considered gross food. What if I were now to allow the bhikkhus, having accepted them at the right time (from dawnrise to noon), to consume them at the right time’….

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「然後他想到：『有這五種滋補品——酥油、新鮮奶油、油、蜂蜜、糖/糖蜜——既是藥物，又被世人認為是藥物，作為食物卻不會被認為是粗劣食物。如果我現在允許比丘們，在正確的時間（從黎明到中午）接受它們，在正確的時間食用，會怎麼樣」…。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time bhikkhus, having accepted the five tonics at the right time, consumed them at the right time. Because of this they could not stomach even ordinary coarse foods, much less rich, greasy ones. As a result, afflicted both by the autumn disease and this loss of appetite for meals, they became even more thin and wretched…. So the Blessed One, with regard to this cause, having given a Dhamma talk, addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, I allow that the five tonics, having been accepted, be consumed at the right time or the wrong time (from noon to dawnrise).’”—`Mv.VI.1.2-5`_

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「那時，諸比丘們，在適當的時候接受了五種補品，在適當的時候食用了它們。因此，他們連普通的粗糧都吃不了，更別說油膩的了。結果，在秋病和食慾不振的雙重折磨下，他們變得更加瘦弱……。為此，世尊在說法之後，對比丘們說：『比丘們，我允許接受之後，在正確的時間或錯誤的時間（從中午到黎明）服食五種補品。』」—`《大品》.六.1.2-5`_

   * - .. The Vibhaṅga defines the five tonics as follows:
     - 《經分別》對五種補品的定義如下：

   * - *Ghee* means strained, boiled butter oil made from the milk of any animal whose flesh is allowable for bhikkhus to eat (see the introduction to the `Food Chapter`_ in the pācittiya rules).

     - *酥油*\是指任何允許比丘食用其肉的動物的奶製成的過濾煮沸的奶油（參見《波逸提》戒條中\ `食物品`_\ 的介紹）。

   * - *Fresh butter* must be made from the milk of any animal whose flesh is allowable. None of the Vinaya texts go into detail on how fresh butter is made, but `MN 126`_ describes the process as “having sprinkled curds in a pot, one twirls them with a churn.” Fresh butter of this sort is still made in India today by taking a small churn—looking like an orange with alternate sections removed, attached to a small stick—and twirling it in curds, all the while sprinkling them with water. The fresh butter—mostly milk fat—coagulates on the churn, and when the fresh butter is removed, what is left in the pot is diluted buttermilk. Fresh butter, unlike creamery butter made by churning cream, may be stored unrefrigerated in bottles for several days even in the heat of India without going rancid.

     - 新鮮奶油必須由任何允許食用其肉的動物的奶製成。律藏文獻中沒有詳細介紹如何製作新鮮奶油，但\ `《中部》126經`_\ 將這一過程描述為「將凝乳撒在鍋中，然後用攪拌器旋轉它們」。如今，這種新鮮奶油在印度仍然是通過取一個小攪拌器（看起來像一個被去除了交替部分的橙子，連接到一根小棍子上）並將其與凝乳一起旋轉，同時在凝乳中撒上水來製作的。新鮮奶油（主要是乳脂）在攪拌器上凝固，當新鮮奶油被取出時，鍋中剩下的就是稀釋的酪乳。與攪拌奶油製成的乳清奶油不同，新鮮奶油即使在印度炎熱的天氣下也可以在不冷藏的情況下在瓶子中保存幾天而不會變質。

   * - Arguing by the Great Standards, creamery butter would obviously come under fresh butter here. A more controversial topic is cheese.
     - 按照《四大教示》，乳清奶油顯然屬於新鮮奶油。一個更有爭議的話題是起司。

   * - In `Mv.VI.34.21`_, the Buddha allows bhikkhus to consume five products of the cow: milk, curds, buttermilk, fresh butter, and ghee. Apparently, cheese—curds heated to evaporate their liquid content and then cured with or without mold—was unknown in those days, but there seems every reason, using the Great Standards, to include it under one of the five. The question is which one. Some have argued that it should come under fresh butter, but the argument for classifying it under curds seems stronger, as it is closer to curds in composition and is generally regarded as more of a substantial food. Different Communities, however, have differing opinions on this matter.

     - 在\ `《大品》.六.34.21`_\ 中，佛陀允許比丘食用五種奶牛產品：牛奶、凝乳、酪乳、新鮮奶油和酥油。顯然，起司——加熱蒸發其液體成分的凝乳，然後在有或沒有黴菌的情況下固化——在當時還不為人所知，但使用《四大教示》，似乎有充分的理由將其納入此五種之一。問題是哪一個。有些人認為它應該歸類為新鮮奶油，但將其歸類為凝乳的論點似乎更強烈，因為它的成分更接近凝乳，並且通常被認為是更大量的食物。然而，不同的僧團對此問題有不同的看法。
