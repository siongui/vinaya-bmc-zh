   * - As explained in the preceding chapter, this term is most probably related to the verb *pacinati*, “to know,” and means “to be made known” or “to be confessed.” There are 92 rules in this category, divided into eight chapters of ten, and one of twelve.

     - 如同上一章節所解釋的，這個術語很可能與動詞 *pacinati* （「知道」）有關，意思是「須被公開」或「須懺悔」。此類別中有 92 條戒條，分為八品各十條和一品十二條。

   * - A deliberate lie is a statement or gesture made with the aim of misrepresenting the truth to someone else. The K/Commentary, summarizing the long “wheels” in the Vibhaṅga, states that a violation of this rule requires two factors:

     - 故意說謊是為了向別人歪曲事實而做出的言論或動作。 K/《義註》總結了《經分別》中的長「輪」，指出違反此戒條需要兩個因素：

   * - *1) Intention:* the aim to misrepresent the truth; and
     - *1）意圖：*\ 以歪曲事實為目的；和

   * - *2) Effort:* the effort to make another individual know whatever one wants to communicate based on that aim.
     - *2）努力：*\ 為了達到這個目的，努力使另一個人了解自己想要傳達的訊息。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The aim to misrepresent the truth fulfills this factor regardless of what one’s motives are. Thus “white lies”—made with benevolent intentions (e.g., to a person whose state of mind is too weak to take the truth)—would fall under this rule, so a bhikkhu who wants to shield an emotionally weak person from harsh truths has to be very skillful in phrasing his statements. Also, outrageous lies meant as jokes—to amuse rather than to deceive—would fall under this rule as well, a point we will discuss further in the non-offense section.

     - 無論動機是什麼，歪曲事實的目的都符合這個因素。因此，「善意的謊言」——出於善意而說的謊言（例如，對一個精神狀態太弱而無法接受真相的人說的謊言）——就屬於本戒條，所以，如果比丘想保護一個情感脆弱的人免受殘酷真相的傷害，他就必須非常巧妙地措辭。此外，出於玩笑目的（為了逗樂而不是欺騙）的離譜謊言也屬於本戒條的範疇，我們將在不犯部分進一步討論這一點。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, to misrepresent the truth means to say that one has seen X when one hasn’t, that one hasn’t seen X when one has, or that one has seen X clearly when one is in doubt about the matter. This pattern holds for the other senses—hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation—as well. Thus to repeat what one has heard, seen, etc., even if it actually is misinformation, does not count as a misrepresentation of the truth under this rule, as one is truthfully reporting what one has seen, etc. If, however, one says that one believes in such misinformation—when one actually doesn’t—one’s statement *would* count as a misrepresentation of the truth and so would fulfill this factor.

     - 根據《經分別》，歪曲事實的意思是說，當他沒有看到X時，卻說他看到了它；當他看到了X時，卻說他沒有看到它；或者當他對該事有疑問時，卻說他清楚地看到了X。這種模式也適用於其他感官——聽覺、嗅覺、味覺、觸覺和思考。因此，重複自己所聽到、所看到等內容，即使它實際上是錯誤的信息，也不算本戒條下的歪曲事實，因為是在如實地報道自己所看到等等。然而，如果說自己相信這些錯誤訊息──而實際上自己並不相信──那麼他的話\ *就*\ 算是歪曲了事實，因此就滿足了這個因素。

   * - According to the Commentary, *effort* here covers falsehoods conveyed not only by speech but also by writing or gesture. As for falsehoods conveyed by silence: `Mv.II.3.3`_ states that if, while listening to the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha, one remembers that one has an unconfessed offense and yet remains silent about it, that counts as a deliberate lie; `Mv.II.3.7`_ then goes on to impose a dukkaṭa for this kind of lie, which suggests that remaining silent in a situation where silence conveys a false message does not fulfill this factor for the full offense here.

     - 根據《義註》，這裡的\ *努力*\ 不僅包括透過言語傳達的謊言，還包括透過寫作或示意動作傳達的謊言。至於透過沉默傳達的謊言：\ `《大品》.二.3.3`_\ 規定，如果在聆聽《波羅提木叉》時，想起自己有未懺悔的罪過，但卻保持沉默，那就算是故意撒謊；然後，\ `《大品》.二.3.7`_\ 繼續對這種謊言施加《突吉羅》，這表明在沉默傳達錯誤訊息的情況下保持沉默並不能滿足此處完全違犯的本因素。

   * - Result is not a factor under this rule. Thus whether anyone understands the lie or is deceived by it is irrelevant to the offense.
     - 根據本戒條，結果不是影響因素。因此，是否有人理解謊言或被謊言欺騙，與犯戒無關。

   * - In cases where a particular lie would fall under another rule—such as `Pr 4`_, `Sg 8`_ or 9_, `Pc 13`_, 24_, or 76_\—the penalties assigned by that rule take precedence over the ones assigned here. For instance, making a false but unspecific claim to a superior human state would entail a thullaccaya under `Pr 4`_; falsely accusing another bhikkhu of a pārājika offense would entail a saṅghādisesa under `Sg 8`_; falsely accusing him of a saṅghādisesa would entail a pācittiya under `Pc 76`_; and falsely accusing him of a lesser offense would entail a dukkaṭa under that rule.

     - 當特定謊言屬於另一條戒條時（例如\ `《波羅夷》四`_\ 、\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 或\ `九`_\ 、\ `《波逸提》十三`_\ 、\ `二四`_\ 或\ `七六`_\ ），該戒條指定的懲罰優先於此處指定的懲罰。例如，對上人法作出虛假但不明確的主張，將導致\ `《波羅夷》四`_\ 下的《偷蘭遮》；虛假地指控另一位比丘犯了《波羅夷》罪，將導致\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 下的《僧殘》；虛假地指控他犯《僧殘》，將導致\ `《波逸提》七六`_\ 下的《波逸提》；而根據該戒條，虛假地指控他犯下輕罪，將導致《突吉羅》。

   * - The Vinaya-mukha argues that this rule should take precedence in cases where a particular lie would entail only a dukkaṭa under any of the other rules—as in the last example—but this contradicts the Vibhaṅga.

     - 《戒律入口》認為，當某個謊言根據其他任何戒條只會導致《突吉羅》時（如最後一個例子），本戒條應該優先於其他任何戒條，但這與《經分別》相矛盾。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - A bhikkhu who misrepresents the truth unintentionally commits no offense under this rule. The Vibhaṅga gives two examples: speaking quickly and saying one thing while meaning another. Its word for “quickly”—\ *davāya*\ —can also mean “in fun,” but the Vibhaṅga itself, in a passage unusual for the non-offenses clauses, defines the term, limiting its meaning specifically to “hurriedly.” In doing so, it conforms to a famous passage from `MN 61`_ where the Buddha shows an empty water dipper to Rāhula, his son, telling him that anyone who feels no shame at uttering a deliberate lie is as empty of the virtues of a contemplative as the dipper is empty of water, and then advises Rāhula to train himself: “I will not utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.”

     - 根據本戒條，無意地歪曲事實的比丘並不犯戒。《經分別》舉了兩個例子：說話過快，以及說某件事但意思卻是另一件事。其中表示「快速」的單字 *davāya* 也可以表示「開玩笑」，但《經分別》本身在一段不常見於不犯條款的段落中對該術語進行了定義，將其含義明確限制為「匆忙地」。這樣做符合\ `《中部》61經`_\ 中的著名段落，佛陀向他的兒子羅睺羅展示了一個空水勺，告訴他，如果有人故意撒謊而毫無羞恥，那麼他就缺乏沙門的美德，就像水勺裡沒有水一樣，然後佛陀建議羅睺羅要自我訓練：「我不會故意撒謊，哪怕是為了開玩笑。」

   * - The Commentary explains the Vibhaṅga’s two exemptions as follows: *Speaking quickly* means speaking before one has carefully considered the matter. *Saying one thing while meaning another* means making a slip of the tongue, either out of stupidity or carelessness. It also seconds the Vibhaṅga in not exempting inaccurate statements made in fun from a penalty under this rule. It illustrates this point with several stories that convey a sense of what passed for humor among the less scrupulous bhikkhus of its time. In the first, a novice asks a bhikkhu, “Have you seen my preceptor?” and the bhikkhu, teasing the novice, responds, “Your preceptor’s probably gone, yoked to a firewood-cart.” In the second story, a novice, hearing the yapping of hyenas, asks a bhikkhu, “What’s making that noise?” and the bhikkhu replies, “That’s the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel of the carriage your mother’s going in.” In addition, the Commentary quotes a few statements that today would be classified as exaggeration or sarcasm, saying that these, too, are forbidden by this rule.

     - 《義註》對《經分別》的兩項豁免作如下解釋：\ *說話過快*\ 意味著在仔細考慮事情之前就說話。\ *說某件事但意思卻是另一件事*\ ，意味著由於愚蠢或粗心而說錯話。它也同意《經分別》不免除因玩笑而做出的不準確言論的懲罰。它用幾個故事說明了這一點，這些故事傳達了當時不太嚴謹的比丘們所認為的幽默感。第一個是，一位沙彌問一位比丘：「你見過我的戒師嗎？」比丘就取笑沙彌，回答說：「你的戒師可能被駕到柴車上走了。」在第二個故事中，一位沙彌聽到鬣狗的吠叫聲，便問一位比丘：「是什麼發出了這種聲音？」比丘回答說：「那是那些抬起你母親所乘車輛陷在泥裡的車輪的人發出的聲音。」此外，《義註》也引用了一些在今天看來會被視為誇張或諷刺的言論，並表示這些言論也是本戒條所禁止的。

   * - Whatever humor these jokes originally contained has been so dulled by time that the statements now seem obviously unworthy of a bhikkhu. A bhikkhu at present whose sense of humor tends toward misrepresentation and exaggeration would do well to develop a similar perspective on his own jokes. This is not to deny the value or potential wisdom of humor; simply to note that a bhikkhu’s sense of humor should be kept in service to his values, and that the most memorable wit is memorable precisely because it tells the straight truth.

     - 這些笑話原本包含的任何幽默，已經隨著時間的流逝而變得如此暗淡，以至於這些話現在看起來顯然不適合比丘說。目前，如果一位比丘的幽默感傾向於扭曲和誇張，他最好對自己的笑話培養類似的看法。這並不是否認幽默的價值或潛在的智慧；只是要注意，比丘的幽默感應該服務於他的價值觀，最令人難忘的智慧之所以令人難忘，正是因為它說出了直截了當的事實。

   * - As we noted above, a bhikkhu who speaks from mistaken assumptions—truthfully reporting any mistaken information he may have received or mistaken beliefs he may have thought up—does not come under this rule.

     - 正如我們上面提到的，如果比丘基於錯誤的假設而講話——如實報告他可能收到的任何錯誤訊息或他可能想到的錯誤信念——則不犯本戒條。

   * - **Broken promises**
     - **違背承諾**

   * - `Mv.III.14.1-14`_ imposes a dukkaṭa on the act of making a promise with pure intentions but later breaking it. Because the texts make no mention of any circumstances beyond one’s control that would exempt one from that penalty, a bhikkhu should be very careful of how he states his plans for the future. A special instance of breaking a promise—accepting an invitation to a meal but then not going—is treated, not under `Mv.III.14.1-14`_, but under `Pc 33`_.

     - `《大品》.三.14.1-14`_\ 對出於純潔意圖作出承諾但後來卻違背承諾的行為施加《突吉羅》。因為文獻中沒有提到任何超出個人控制範圍的情況可以免除這種懲罰，所以比丘應該對如何陳述他對未來的計劃非常小心。違背承諾的一個特殊例子——接受了用餐邀請但後來卻不去——不是在\  `《大品》.三.14.1-14`_\ 中處理，而是在\ `《波逸提》三三`_\ 中處理。

   * - *Summary: The intentional effort to misrepresent the truth to another individual is a pācittiya offense.*

          *侮辱，波逸提。*

   * - An insult is a gesture or statement, written or spoken, made with the malicious intent of hurting another person’s feelings or of bringing him/her into disgrace. The Vibhaṅga analyzes the full offense under this rule in terms of three factors:

     - 侮辱是一種書面或口頭的手勢或言論，目的是惡意傷害他人感情或使他人蒙羞。《經分別》從三個因素分析了本戒條下的完全違犯：

   * - *1) Effort:* One insults a person directly to his face, touching on any one of the ten topics for abuse *(akkosa-vatthu)* listed below.
     - *1）努力：*\當面侮辱某人，觸及下面列出的十個辱罵主題\ *（akkosa-vatthu）*\ 中的任何一個。

   * - *2) Object:* The person is a bhikkhu.
     - *2）對象：*\ 該人是比丘。

     - *3）意圖：*\ 動機是羞辱他。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga lists ten ways a verbal insult can be phrased: making remarks about the other person’s:
     - 《經分別》列出了十種言語侮辱的表達方式：對他人進行以下的評論：

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *身體特徵*\（嘿，胖子！瘦高個！蝦米！綠巨人！）；

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *defilements* (You control freak! Fool! Queer! Breeder!);

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *褻瀆*\（你這個控制狂！傻瓜！同性戀！繁殖狂！）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *offenses* (You liar! You thief!); or

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *冒犯*\（你這個騙子！你這個小偷！）；或者

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *using an abusive form of address*, such as, “You camel! You goat! You ass! You penis! You vagina!” (§) (All five of these come from the Vibhaṅga.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *用辱罵性的稱謂*\，如「你這隻駱駝！你這個山羊！你這個混蛋！你這個陰莖！你這個陰道！（§）（此五句皆出自《經分別》。）

   * - (The category of “offense”—which literally means “falling”—contains an interesting sub-category, in that the noble attainment of stream-entry is, literally, “falling into the stream.” Thus an insult along the lines of, “Some stream-winner you are!” would also fit under this category as well.)

     - （「冒犯」這個類別的字面意思是「墮落」，它包含一個有趣的子類別，即入流的聖成就，字面意思是「墮入果位」。因此，類似「你真是個果位獲得者！」這樣的侮辱也屬於這一類別。）

   * - These ten topics are called the *akkosa-vatthu*\—topics for abuse—and appear in the following training rule as well.
     - 這十個主題被稱為 *akkosa-vatthu*\（辱罵主題），也出現在以下學處中。

   * - As the examples in the Vibhaṅga show, the remark that fulfills the factor of effort here must touch on one of these topics for abuse and must be made directly to the listener: “You are X.” It may be phrased either as sarcastic praise or as out-and-out abuse. The Commentary and Sub-commentary say that any insulting remark not listed in the Vibhaṅga would only be grounds for a dukkaṭa, but the Vibhaṅga defines the topics for abuse in such a general way that *any* term related to them in any way would fulfill this factor here.

     - 正如《經分別》中的例子所示，這裡滿足努力因素的言論必須涉及這些辱罵主題之一，並且必須直接對聽者說：「你是 X 」。它既可以表現為諷刺性的讚揚，也可以表現為徹頭徹尾的辱罵。《義註》和《複註》說，任何未在《經分別》中列出的侮辱性言論都只能成為《突吉羅》的理由，但《經分別》對辱罵的主題進行了非常籠統的定義，以至於\ *任何*\ 與它們相關的術語都可以滿足此處的這個因素。

   * - Remarks made in an indirect or insinuating manner, though, would not fulfill this factor. *Indirect remarks* are when the speaker includes himself together with the target of his insult in his statement (“We’re all a bunch of fools”). *Insinuating remarks* are when he leaves it uncertain as to whom he is referring to (“There are camels among us”). Any remark of either of these sorts, if meant as an insult, entails a dukkaṭa regardless of whether the target is a bhikkhu or not.

     - 然而，以間接或影射的方式發表的言論並不能滿足這一因素。\ *間接言論*\ 是指說話者在言論中將自己與被侮辱的對象連結在一起（「我們都是一群傻瓜」）。\ *影射言論*\ 是指當他不明確指出是誰時，（「我們中間有駱駝」）。任何上述言論，如果意在侮辱，無論對象是否為比丘，都會犯《突吉羅》。

   * - All of the insults mentioned in the Vibhaṅga take the form of remarks about the person, whereas insults and verbal abuse at present often take the form of a command—Go to hell! F— off! etc.—and the question is whether these too would be covered by this rule. Viewed from the standpoint of intent, they fit under the general definition of an insult; but if for some reason they would not fit under this rule, they would in most cases be covered by `Pc 54`_.

     - 《經分別》中提到的所有侮辱都是對人的評價，而當今的侮辱和言語虐待常常以命令的形式出現－去死吧！滾！等等－問題是這些是否也包含在本戒條中。從意圖的角度來看，它們符合侮辱的一般定義；但如果由於某種原因它們不符合本戒條，則大多數情況下它們將符合\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 。

   * - Insulting remarks made about someone behind his/her back are dealt with under `Pc 13`_.
     - 在背後對某人發表的侮辱性言論將根據\ `《波逸提》十三`_\ 處理。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - To insult a bhikkhu incurs a pācittiya; to insult an unordained person—according to the Commentary, this runs the gamut from bhikkhunīs to all other living beings—a dukkaṭa.

     - 侮辱比丘犯《波逸提》；侮辱未受具足戒的人——根據《義註》，這適用於從比丘尼到所有其他生物——《突吉羅》。

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines this factor as “desiring to jeer at, desiring to scoff at, desiring to make (him) abashed.” If, with no insult intended, a bhikkhu jokes about another person’s race, etc., he incurs a dubbhāsita, regardless of whether the person is lay or ordained, mentioned outright or insinuatingly, and regardless of whether he/she takes it as a joke or an insult. This is the only instance of this class of offense.

     - 《經分別》將此因素定義為「想要嘲笑、想要嘲弄、想要讓（他）羞愧」。如果比丘開玩笑地談論別人的種族等，而無意冒犯，則無論此人是在家人還是出家人，是直接提及還是暗示，也無論他/她將其視為玩笑還是侮辱，他犯《惡說》（dubbhāsita）。這是此類犯戒的唯一例子。

   * - The K/Commentary adds result as a fourth factor—the target of one’s insult knows, “He’s insulting me”—but there is no basis for this in either the Vibhaṅga or the Commentary. If one makes an insulting remark under one’s breath, not intending to be heard—or in a foreign language, not intending to be understood—the motive would be to let off steam, which would not qualify as the intention covered by this rule. If one truly wants to humiliate someone, one will make the necessary effort to make that person hear and understand one’s words. But if for some reason that person *doesn’t* hear or understand (a loud noise blots out one’s words, one uses a slang term that is new to one’s listener), there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to indicate that one would escape from the full penalty.

     - K/《義註》加入了結果作為第四個因素，即被侮辱的人知道「他在侮辱我」——但在《經分別》和《義註》都沒有任何此依據。如果低聲說出侮辱性言論，而無意讓別人聽到，或用外語說出侮辱性言論，而無意讓別人理解，其動機可能是為了發洩，這不屬於本戒條所涵蓋的意圖。如果真正想羞辱某人，他就會盡一切努力讓那個人聽到並理解他的話。但如果由於某種原因，那個人\ *沒有*\ 聽見或聽\ *不*\ 懂（巨大的噪音遮住了話語，使用了聽眾不熟悉的俚語），《經分別》中沒有任何內容表明可以逃脫全部懲罰。

   * - For this reason, whether the person addressed actually feels insulted by one’s remarks is irrelevant in determining the severity of the offense. If one makes a remark to a fellow bhikkhu, touching on one of the topics for abuse and meaning it as an insult, one incurs a pācittiya even if he takes it as a joke. If one means the remark as a joke, one incurs a dubbhāsita even if the other person feels insulted.

     - 因此，聽者是否真的覺得被自己的言論侮辱，與判斷犯戒的嚴重程度無關。如果對一位比丘同儕發表言論，觸及辱罵主題之一，且意圖侮辱，那麼即使他只當做笑話，也會犯《波逸提》。如果言論意圖只是開玩笑，那麼即使另一方感覺受到了侮辱，犯《惡說》。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, a bhikkhu who mentions another person’s race, etc., commits no offense if he is “aiming at Dhamma, aiming at (the person’s) benefit (*attha*\—this can also mean “the goal”), aiming at teaching.” The Commentary illustrates this with a bhikkhu saying to a member of the untouchable caste: “You are an untouchable. Don’t do any evil. Don’t be a person born into misfortune and going on to misfortune.”

     - 根據《經分別》，如果比丘「旨在於法、旨在於（該人的）利益（\ *attha*\——這也可以表示「目標」）、旨在於教導」，那麼當他提及他人的種族等時，並不構成犯戒。《義註》中以一位比丘對賤民種姓成員所說的話為例：「你是賤民。莫做惡事。不要做一個生來不幸、走向不幸的人。」

   * - Another example would be of a teacher who uses insulting language to get the attention of a stubborn student so that the latter will bring his behavior in line with the Dhamma. This would entail no offense, but one should be very sure of the purity of one’s motives and of the beneficial effect of one’s words before using language of this sort.

     - 另一個例子是，一位老師使用侮辱性的語言來引起頑固學生的注意，以便後者的行為符合法。這並不犯戒，但是在使用此類語言之前，我們應該非常確定自己動機的純潔性以及言語的有益效果。

   * - *Summary: An insult made with malicious intent to another bhikkhu is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：懷著惡意侮辱另一位比丘，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

          *Divisive tale-bearing among bhikkhus is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *在比丘之間分裂性的搬弄是非，波逸提。*

   * - Divisive tale-bearing is described in the Vibhaṅga with a series of examples in the following form: X makes remarks about Y touching on his race, name, or any of the other ten *akkosa-vatthu* listed in the explanation to the preceding rule. Z, hearing these remarks, goes to tell someone else—either W or Y himself—in hopes of causing a rift between X and his listener or of winning favor with his listener in case there is already a rift between the two. For example:

     - 《經分別》以下列形式舉了一系列例子來描述分裂性的搬弄是非： X 對 Y 的種族、姓名或在前一條戒條的解釋中列出的其他十個 *akkosa-vatthu* 發表言論。 Z 聽到這些言論後，便去告訴其他人（ W 或 Y 本人），希望能引起 X 和他的聽者之間的裂痕，或者在兩人之間已經有裂痕的情況下贏得聽者的好感。例如：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          a\) X calls Y a bastard behind his back. Z tells Y, in hopes of ingratiating himself with Y.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          a）X 背地裡罵 Y 是混蛋。 Z 告訴 Y，希望能討好 Y。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          b\) X makes racist remarks about Y to his face. Z knows that W is a friend of Y and hates racists, and so tells W what X said, in hopes of causing a rift between W and X.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          b）X 當面對 Y 發表種族主義言論。 Z 知道 W 是 Y 的朋友，並且討厭種族主義者，所以就把 X 說的話告訴了 W，希望藉此挑起 W 和 X 之間的裂痕。

   * - Bhikkhu Z commits the full offense here when three factors are fulfilled: object, effort, and intent.
     - 當滿足三個因素時，比丘 Z 就犯了全部罪行：對象、努力和意圖。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Object:* Both Z’s listener and X are bhikkhus; X has made remarks about Y that qualify as a direct insult under the preceding rule—or, if he didn’t make them in Y’s presence, remarks that would have qualified as a direct insult had he done so. (Note that under case (b) above, Y would not have to be a bhikkhu for this factor to be fulfilled.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）對象：*\  Z 的聽者和 X 都是比丘； X 對 Y 發表的言論根據前一條戒條可視為直接侮辱；或者，如果他沒有在 Y 面前發表這些言論，他真的這麼說了屬於直接侮辱的言論。（請注意，在上述情況 (b) 中，Y 不必是比丘即可滿足此因素。）

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Effort:* Z reports X’s remarks to his listener verbally or by gesture (as in writing a letter),

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）努力：*\  Z 透過口頭或示意動作（如寫信）向他的聽者傳達 X 的言論，

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *3) Intent:* with the intent of ingratiating himself with his listener, or of causing a rift between his listener and X.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *3）意圖：*\ 意圖討好聽者，或造成聽者與 X 之間的裂痕。

   * - The K/Commentary adds a fourth factor—Z’s listener understands what he is saying—but, as with the preceding rule, there is no basis for this in the Vibhaṅga.
     - K/《義註》增加了第四個因素—— Z 的聽眾理解他在說什麼——但是，與前一條戒條一樣，在《經分別》中沒有這一點的依據。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - If either X or Z’s listener—or both—are not bhikkhus, then the penalty for Z is a dukkaṭa.
     - 如果 X 或 Z 的聽者（或兩者）不是比丘，那麼 Z 的懲罰就是《突吉羅》。

   * - If X’s remarks qualified only as an indirect insult under the preceding rule—e.g., he said with reference to Y that, “There are camels among us”—then Z incurs a dukkaṭa if he reports them with the intent to ingratiate himself or cause a rift, regardless of whether his listener or X are bhikkhus or not.

     - 如果 X 的言論根據前一條戒條僅屬於間接侮辱——例如，他對 Y 說，「我們之間有駱駝」——那麼如果 Z 以討好或製造裂痕為目的報道這些言論，無論聽者或 X 是否是比丘，犯《突吉羅》。

   * - The Sub-commentary states that there is a dukkaṭa for bearing tales dealing with matters other than remarks about the ten *akkosa-vatthu*\—i.e., telling Y about things said or done by X, to make X appear in a bad light in hopes of winning favor or causing a rift—although some cases of this sort would come under `Pc 13`_.

     - 《複註》指出，除了關於十種 *akkosa-vatthu* 的言論之外，其他事項的搬弄是非犯《突吉羅》—即，告訴 Y 有關 X 所說或所做的事情，使 X 看起來很糟糕，希望贏得好感或造成裂痕—雖然有些這種情況屬於\ `《波逸提》十三`_\ 。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - This rule is sometimes translated as dealing with slander—false tale-bearing—but as the examples in the Vibhaṅga show, it actually deals with true tale-bearing: X really does say insulting things about Y, and Z gives a true report. The Vinaya-mukha notes that if Z engages in false tale-bearing, then regardless of whether X and Z’s listener are bhikkhus, Z incurs the full penalty under `Pc 1`_.

     - 本戒條有時被翻譯為處理誹謗——虛假的搬弄是非——但正如《經分別》中的例子所示，它實際上處理的是真實的搬弄是非：X 確實說了關於 Y 的侮辱性的話，而 Z 給出了真實的報道。《戒律入口》指出，如果 Z 散佈虛假的搬弄是非，那麼無論 X 和 Z 的聽者是否是比丘，Z 完全違犯\ `《波逸提》一`_\ 。

   * - **Intent**
     - **意圖**

   * - To give a true report of such matters with motives other than those of winning favor or causing a rift entails no offense. Examples of this would include:
     - 如果真實地報道這些事情並且不是為了贏得好感或製造裂痕，則並不構成犯戒。例如：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          informing a senior bhikkhu when one bhikkhu has accused another of a serious offense, so that an inquiry can be made for the sake of harmony in the Community; or

     - .. container:: mx-2

          當一個比丘指控另一個比丘犯有嚴重罪行時，要通知一位資深比丘，以便為了僧團的和合而進行調查；或者

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          telling a senior bhikkhu about a student of his who is making racist remarks, so that the senior bhikkhu can put a stop to it.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          告訴一位資深比丘，他的一位弟子正在發表種族主義言論，以便這位資深比丘可以阻止這種行為。

   * - *Summary: Telling a bhikkhu about insulting remarks made by another bhikkhu—in hopes of winning favor or causing a rift—is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：為了博取好感或製造裂痕，向一位比丘講述另一位比丘的侮辱性言論，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Effort:* One gets a student to recite Dhamma line-by-line with oneself (which, as we shall see below, means to train the student to be a skilled reciter of a Pali Dhamma text).

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）努力：*\ 讓弟子與自己一起一行一行地背誦佛法（正如我們將在下文中看到的，這意味著訓練弟子成為熟練的巴利語佛法誦讀者）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Object:* The student is neither a bhikkhu nor a bhikkhunī.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）對象：*\ 弟子既不是比丘，也不是比丘尼。

   * - Only the first factor needs explanation, and is best treated under two headings: Dhamma and reciting line-by-line.
     - 只有第一個因素需要解釋，最好用兩個標題來處理：佛法和逐行背誦。

   * - **Dhamma**
     - **佛法**

   * - *Dhamma* the Vibhaṅga defines as “a saying made by the Buddha, his disciples, seers, or heavenly beings, connected with the teaching or connected with the goal.” The Commentary devotes a long discussion to these terms, coming to the conclusion that *connected with the Dhamma* refers to the Pali Canon—in Pali, not in translation—as agreed on in the first three councils, while *connected with the goal (attha)* refers to the Mahā Aṭṭhakathā, the most revered ancient commentary (only in its original Pali version, the Sub-commentary says).

     - 《經分別》將\ *佛法*\ 定義為「佛陀、其弟子、先知或天人所說的與教義或目標相關的話」。《義註》對這些術語進行了長討論，得出結論：\ *與佛法相關*\ 指的是巴利《聖典》（巴利語，而非翻譯），正如前三次結集所達成的一致意見，而\ *與目標（attha）相關*\ 指的是《Mahā Aṭṭhakathā》，即最受尊敬的古代註釋（《複註》稱僅限其原始巴利語版本）。

   * - The ancient commentaries disagreed as to what other works would fit under this category, but Buddhaghosa’s conclusion seems to be that—in the *Milinda Pañhā*, for example—Ven. Nāgasena’s quotes of the Buddha’s words would count, but not his own formulations of the teaching, and the same principle holds for other texts quoting the Buddha’s words as well. The ancient commentaries are unanimous, though, in saying that *Dhamma* does *not* cover the Mahāyāna sūtras or any compositions (this would include translations) dealing with the Dhamma in languages other than Pali.

     - 古代註釋對於哪些其他作品可以歸入這一類別意見不一，但\ `佛音`_\ 的結論似乎是——例如在\ `《彌蘭王問經》`_\ 中——龍軍尊者所引述的佛陀話語可以算在內，但他自己對教義的表述則不算數，同樣的原則也適用於引用佛陀話語的其他文獻。然而，古代註釋一致認為，\ *佛法*\ 並\ *不*\ 涵蓋大乘經典或任何巴利語以外的語言論述佛法的作品（這包括翻譯作品）。

   * - This interpretation, identifying *Dhamma* with particular Pali texts, has caused no controversy in the context of this rule—although it seems unlikely that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga would have had the commentaries in mind when they said, “connected with the goal”—but it *has* met with disagreement in the context of `Pc 7`_, and so we will discuss it in more detail there.

     - 這種將\ *佛法*\ 與特定的巴利文獻聯繫起來的解釋，在本戒條的脈絡下沒有引起任何爭議——儘管《經分別》的編纂者在說「與目標相關」時似乎不太可能想到註釋——但它\ *確實*\ 在\ `《波逸提》七`_\ 的脈絡下遭到了反對，因此我們將在那裡更詳細地討論它。

   * - **Reciting line-by-line**

   * - To make someone recite line by line means to train him/her by rote to be a skilled reciter of a text.
     - 讓某人一行一行地背誦意味著透過死記硬背來訓練他/她成為文獻的熟練背誦者。

   * - Bhikkhus in the days of the Buddha committed the teachings in the Canon to memory to preserve them from generation to generation. Although writing was in use at the time—mainly for keeping accounts—no one used it to record teachings either of the Buddha or of any other religious teacher. The Pali Canon was not written down until approximately 500 years after the Buddha’s passing away, after an invasion of Sri Lanka had threatened its survival.

     - 佛陀時代的比丘們將《聖典》中的教義銘記於心，以便代代傳承。儘管當時已經使用文字（主要用於記帳），但沒有人用它來記錄佛陀或其他宗教導師的教義。直到佛陀圓寂約 500 年後，由於斯里蘭卡遭到入侵，巴利《聖典》的存亡受到威脅，才寫成文字成書。

   * - The Vibhaṅga lists four ways in which a person might be trained to be a reciter of a text:
     - 《經分別》列出了四種訓練一個人成為背誦者的方法：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          1\) The teacher and student recite in unison, i.e., beginning together and ending together.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          1）師生同聲背誦，即一起開始，一起結束。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          2\) The teacher begins a line, the student joins in, and they end together.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          2）老師開始某一行，學生加入，最後他們一起結束。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          3\) The teacher recites the beginning syllable of a line together with the student, who then completes it alone.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          3）老師和學生一起背誦某一行的首個音節，然後學生獨自完成。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          4\) The teacher recites one line, and the student recites the next line alone.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          4）老師背誦某一行，學生單獨背誦下一行。

   * - At present, reciters of the Vedas still use these methods when practicing their texts.
     - 目前，\ `吠陀`_\ 的背誦者在練習他們的文獻時仍會使用這些方法。

   * - The origin story states that the Buddha forbade these methods of training unordained people because they caused the lay students to feel disrespect for the bhikkhus. The Vinaya-mukha explains this by noting that if a teacher made a slip of the tongue while teaching in this way, his students would look down on him for it. If this were the right explanation, though, the non-offense clauses would have listed “proper” ways of training novices and lay people to recite the Dhamma, but they don’t.

     - `起源故事 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0019a06>`__\ 說，佛陀禁止這些訓練非受具足戒者的方法，因為它們導致在家學生對比丘感到不尊重。《戒律入口》對此的解釋是：如果老師以這種方式教學時口誤，他的學生就會因此看不起他。如果這是正確的解釋，那麼不犯條款就會列出訓練沙彌和俗人背誦佛法的「適當」方法，但它並未列出。

   * - A more likely explanation is that at the time of the Buddha the duty of memorizing and reciting the texts was considered the province of the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs. Although some lay people memorized discourses (`Mv.III.5.9`_), and bhikkhus of course taught the Dhamma to lay people, there was apparently the feeling that to teach non-ordainees to become skilled reciters of the texts was not good for the relationship between bhikkhus and the unordained. There are three possible reasons for this:

     - 更可能的解釋是，在佛陀時代，記憶和背誦經文被認為是比丘和比丘尼的職責。雖然有些在家眾會記憶經文（\ `《大品》.三.5.9`_\ ），而比丘當然也會向在家眾宣講佛法，但是顯然人們覺得，教導非受具足戒者成為熟練的文獻背誦者，不利於比丘與非受具足戒者之間的關係。可能的原因有三：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          1\) People may have felt that the bhikkhus were shirking their responsibilities by trying to pass their duty off onto others.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          1）人們或許覺得比丘們試圖將自己的職責推給別人，從而逃避自己的責任。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          2\) Brahmans at the time were very strict in not allowing anyone outside their caste to memorize the Vedas, and their example may have led lay people to feel disrespect for bhikkhus who were not equally protective of their own tradition.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          2）當時的婆羅門非常嚴格，不允許其種姓之外的任何人背誦\ `吠陀`_\ ，他們的例子可能導致俗人對那些沒有同樣保護自己傳統的比丘感到不尊重。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          3\) A bhikkhu acting as a tutor for a lay person wishing to memorize the Dhamma might, over time, come to be seen as the lay person’s hireling.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          3）一位比丘擔任一位想要記憶佛法的俗人的導師，隨著時間的推移，可能會被視為這位俗人的僱工。

   * - At present, the entire Canon is available in print, and even bhikkhus rarely commit it to memory, although they do frequently memorize parts of it, such as the Pāṭimokkha, the major discourses, and other passages chanted on ceremonial occasions. To train a lay person or novice to become skilled in reciting such teachings by rote would entail the full penalty under this rule.

     - 目前，整部《聖典》均已印刷出版，即使是比丘也很少將其牢記在心，儘管他們經常會記住其中的部分內容，例如《波羅提木叉》、主要經文和其他在儀式場合朗誦的段落。根據本戒條，訓練一名俗人或沙彌熟練地背誦這些教義，將完全違犯本戒條。

   * - Offenses are counted as follows: If teaching an unordained person to recite line-by-line, one incurs a pācittiya for each line; if teaching syllable-by-syllable, a pācittiya for each syllable.

     - 犯戒的次數如下：若教未受具足戒者一行一行背誦，則每行犯一次《波逸提》；如果逐個音節地教學，則每個音節犯一次《波逸提》。

   * - *Intention* is not a mitigating factor here. Thus if a bhikkhu is training a mixed group of bhikkhus and novices, he incurs a pācittiya even if his intention is to train only the bhikkhus in the group.

     - *意圖*\ 在此不是一個減輕懲罰的因素。因此，如果一位比丘正在訓練一個由比丘和沙彌組成的混合團體，那麼即使他的意圖只是訓練該團體中的比丘，他也犯《波逸提》。

   * - *Perception* is also not a mitigating factor. If the person being trained is unordained, the bhikkhu incurs a pācittiya if he perceives him as unordained, a pācittiya if he is in doubt about the matter, and a pācittiya if he perceives him as ordained. If the person is ordained, then the bhikkhu incurs a dukkaṭa if he perceives him as unordained and a dukkaṭa if he is in doubt about the matter. Only if the person is ordained and the bhikkhu perceives him as ordained is he not grounds for an offense. *This pattern of six possibilities—three pācittiyas, two dukkaṭas, and one non-offense—is standard in many of the pācittiya rules where perception is not a mitigating factor.* We will note other rules in this chapter where this pattern also applies, but explain it in detail only here.

     - *感知*\ 也不是一個減輕懲罰因素。若受訓練者尚未受具足戒，且比丘認為該人尚未受具足戒，則犯《波逸提》；若比丘對此事有所懷疑，則犯《波逸提》；若比丘認為該人已受具足戒，則犯《波逸提》。如果該人已受具足戒，而比丘認為該人未受具足戒，則犯《突吉羅》；如果比丘對此事有所懷疑，則犯《突吉羅》。只有當該人已受具足戒，且比丘認為該人已受具足戒時，才不構成犯戒。\ *此六種可能性的模式——三《波逸提》、兩《突吉羅》和一不犯——是許多《波逸提》戒條的標準，在這些戒條中，感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素。*\ 我們將在本章中指出此模式也適用的其他戒條，但僅在此詳細解釋。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - Because this rule is aimed at methods of teaching, the Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense “for one made to recite in unison.” This, says the Commentary, refers to a young bhikkhu who, in the process of learning a text, is told by his teacher to recite together with a novice who is also the teacher’s student.

     - 因為本戒條針對的是教學方法，所以《經分別》規定「讓一個人齊聲朗誦」並無犯戒。《義註》說，這指的是一位年輕比丘在學習一部經文的過程中，被老師要求與另一位沙彌（也是老師的學生）一起背誦。

   * - Also, according to the Vibhaṅga, there is no offense if a bhikkhu corrects an unordained person who has memorized most of a passage or who is reciting in a confused manner; or if a bhikkhu “rehearses” a passage in unison with unordained people. In the time of the Canon, this meant the practice of reciting a passage one had already memorized. At present, this would include the practice of bhikkhus reciting together with lay people who are reading from a text or reciting from memory—for example, during the evening chanting—and are not learning the text from the bhikkhus. The Commentary extends this allowance to include cases of bhikkhus learning a text from an unordained person, probably on the model of the Itivuttaka, which—according to its Commentary—the bhikkhus first learned from a servant woman who had memorized some of the Buddha’s teachings that the bhikkhus had overlooked.

     - 此外，根據《經分別》的規定，如果比丘糾正一個沒有受具足戒的人，而該人已經記住了大部分經文，或者以混亂的方式誦讀，這並不構成犯戒；或比丘與未受具足戒的眾人一同「排練」一段經文。在《聖典》時代，這意味著背誦已經記住的段落的做法。目前，這包括比丘與正在閱讀經文或背誦記憶的俗人一起誦讀的做法（例如，在晚課誦經時），而不是從比丘那裡學習經文。《義註》將這種開緣擴展到包括比丘從未受具足戒者那裡學習經文的情況，可能是以《如是語經》為模型，根據《如是語經》的《義註》，比丘首先從一名女僕那裡學習，這名女僕記住了比丘們忽略的一些佛陀教義。

          *Should any bhikkhu lie down together (in the same dwelling) with an unordained person for more than two or three consecutive nights, it is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘與未受具足戒者（在同一住所）同寢超過連續兩三個夜晚，波逸提。*

   * - As the Vinaya-mukha comments, “The Buddha originally laid down the rule forbidding the act of sleeping in the same dwelling with an unordained person so that lay people would not see the unsightly attitudes a bhikkhu might assume while asleep. But then when novices came into being they were classed as unordained people and so had no place to stay. The Buddha therefore relaxed the rule, allowing bhikkhus to sleep in the same dwelling with an unordained person no more than three nights running, thus also opening the way for them to sleep in the same dwelling with ordinary lay men.”

     - 正如《戒律入口》所說：「佛陀最初制定本戒條，禁止與未受具足戒的人同睡在同一住處，是為了讓俗人看不到比丘在睡覺時可能呈現的難看姿態。但當沙彌開始出現時，他們就被歸類為未受具足戒者，因此無處可居。因此，佛陀放寬了戒條，允許比丘與未受具足戒者同睡在同一住所，但不得超過三個連續夜晚，這也為比丘與普通俗人同睡在同一住所開闢了道路。」

   * - The occasion for the first formulation of the rule was this:
     - 本戒條首次制定的場合如下：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time, lay men came to the monastery to hear the Dhamma. After the Dhamma had been taught, each of the elder bhikkhus went to his own dwelling, while the newer bhikkhus went to sleep right there in the assembly hall with the lay men—with muddled mindfulness, unalert, naked, mumbling, and snoring. The lay men criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can their reverences go to sleep with muddled mindfulness, unalert, naked, mumbling, and snoring?’”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「\ `當時，很多俗人來到寺院聽法。 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0021a06>`_\ 教導完佛法之後，各位長老比丘各自回自己的住處，而新比丘則就在集會堂裡與俗人一起睡覺——失正念、毫無警覺、赤身裸體、喃喃自語、鼾聲不斷。俗人批評、抱怨並四處傳播：『大德怎麼能失正念、毫無警覺、赤身裸體、喃喃自語、打鼾地睡覺呢？』」

   * - The occasion for the final formulation was this:
     - 最終制定的場合如下：

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “The bhikkhus said to Ven. Rāhula (who was a novice at the time), ‘There is a training rule laid down by the Blessed One that (a bhikkhu) should not lie down together with an unordained person. Find yourself a place to sleep.’ So Ven. Rāhula, not finding a place to sleep, went to sleep in the restroom. Then the Blessed One, getting up toward the end of the night, went to the restroom and on arriving cleared his throat. Ven. Rāhula cleared his throat.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「比丘們對羅睺羅尊者（當時是沙彌）說：『世尊有制定學處，即（比丘）不得與未受具足戒者同寢。自己找個地方睡覺。』羅睺羅尊者找不到地方睡覺，所以就到廁所睡覺。然後，世尊在夜晚將結束時起床，前往廁所，一到那兒就清了清喉嚨。羅睺羅尊者也清了清喉嚨。

   * - There are two factors for the full offense here:
     - 此處的完全違犯有兩個因素：

   * - *1) Object:* an unordained person.
     - *1）對象：*\ 未受具足戒者。

   * - *2) Effort:* (a) lying down, (b) together in the same dwelling with the unordained person, (c) for four nights running.
     - *2）努力：*\ （a）躺下，（b）與未受具足戒者同一住處，（c）連續四夜。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *unordained person* as anyone other than a bhikkhu. The Sub-commentary, citing the Three Gaṇṭhipadas, notes that this means males but not females, as there is another training rule, following immediately on this one, dealing specifically with females. According to the Commentary, *unordained person* includes not only human beings but also any animal large enough to have intercourse with. Again, the Sub-commentary would qualify this as “male animals” for the same reason.

     - 《經分別》將\ *未受具足戒者*\ 定義為比丘以外的任何人。《複註》引用了《Three Gaṇṭhipadas》，指出這指的是男性，而不是女性，因為緊接著本戒條還有另一條學處，專門針對女性。根據《義註》，\ *未受具足戒者*\ 不僅包括人類，還包括任何大到可以進行性交的動物。再一次，由於同樣的原因，《複註》將其限定為「雄性動物」。

   * - Perception as to whether the other person is ordained is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 對於對方是否已受具足戒的感知在此並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Lying down**
     - **躺下**

   * - To be lying down together with someone else means to be lying down at the same time as the other person is lying down within the area defined as a dwelling (see below). This factor is fulfilled whether the bhikkhu lies down when the other person is already lying there, or vice versa, or both lie down at the same time. Although there are other training rules where lying down is included under the term *sitting*, sitting is *not* included under the term *lying down* here. Whether the bhikkhu or the other person falls asleep is of no account.

     - 與他人一起躺下意味著與他人在被定義為住處的區域內同時躺下（見下文）。無論比丘在另一個人已經躺下時躺下，或反之亦然，或兩人同時躺下，此因素均已滿足。雖然在其他學處中，躺下也包含在\ *坐下*\ 一詞中，但這裡坐下並\ *不*\ 包含在\ *躺下*\ 一詞中。無論比丘還是其他人是否睡著了都無關緊要。

   * - If both parties get up and then lie down again, the bhikkhu incurs another pācittiya.
     - 若雙方都起身又再次躺下，則比丘將犯另一次《波逸提》。

   * - **Dwelling**
     - **住處**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines the dwelling that can be grounds for a pācittiya here as a place fully roofed and fully walled, or mostly roofed and mostly walled. A place half-roofed and half-walled, it says, is grounds for a dukkaṭa, while a place (a) fully roofed but with no wall (e.g., an open pavilion), (b) fully walled but with no roof (e.g., a corral), or (c) less than half-roofed and less than half-walled, is not grounds for an offense.

     - 《經分別》將構成《波逸提》罪的住所定義為完全覆蓋屋頂和完全覆蓋牆壁的地方，或大部分覆蓋屋頂和大部分覆蓋牆壁的地方。它稱，半覆蓋屋頂和半覆蓋牆壁的地方構成《突吉羅》罪，而 (a) 完全覆蓋屋頂但沒有牆壁的地方（例如，開放式亭子），(b) 完全覆蓋牆壁但沒有屋頂的地方（例如，畜欄），或 (c) 屋頂覆蓋少於一半和牆壁覆蓋少於一半的地方，不構成犯戒。

   * - Buddhaghosa quotes the Mahā Aṭṭhakathā, the major ancient commentary, as filling in all the other possibilities:

   * - The Commentary notes that tents would fit under the definition of “place” here, and it would seem that vehicles—caravans in the time of the Buddha; automobiles, trains, buses, and airplanes in ours—would fit here as well.

     - 《義註》指出，帳篷符合這裡「住處」的定義，而且似乎交通工具——佛陀時代的大篷車；我們生活中的汽車、火車、巴士和飛機——在此處也同樣符合。

   * - **The same dwelling**
     - **同一住處**

   * - Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga does not say how far the boundary of a “single dwelling” would extend. For example, would each separate room in a house count as a separate dwelling? Would the entire house? Would an entire apartment building be a single dwelling? The Commentary tries to remedy this omission by introducing the factor of “having a single common entrance” or “being part of the same enclosure.” (The Pali word it uses, *ek’ūpacāra*, has both meanings, and the Commentary makes use of both in its discussion.)

     - 不幸的是，《經分別》並沒有說明「單一住處」的邊界延伸到多遠。例如，房屋中的每個獨立房間是否算是獨立住處？整個房子算是嗎？整棟公寓大樓會是單一住處嗎？《義註》試圖透過引入「擁有單一公共入口」或「屬於同一封閉區域」的因素來彌補這一遺漏。（其中所使用的巴利單字 *ek’ūpacāra* 兼具這兩種意義，《義註》在討論中也運用了這兩種意義。）

   * - What it says is this: Even a seven-story palace or a building with 100 rooms would count as a single dwelling if all the rooms make use of a common entrance. If there are several buildings in a single enclosure, and one can go from one to another without stepping on outside ground, they would count as part of the same dwelling. If there is a building divided into units that are not connected by internal doorways, each unit having a separate entrance, the different units would count as separate dwellings. Locking or closing a door does *not* close off the doorway. Only if the door opening is bricked up or otherwise permanently sealed off does it no longer count as a doorway.

     - 它所說的是這樣的：即使是七層宮殿或擁有 100 個房間的建築物，如果所有房間都使用一個公共入口，將算作單一住處。如果單一封閉區域內有多座建築物，並且可以從一棟建築物走到另一棟建築物而不需要踩踏外面的地面，那麼這些建築物將算作同一住處的一部分。如果一座建築物被分成多個單元，且這些單元之間沒有內部門口連接，每個單元都有單獨的入口，則不同的單元將被視為單獨的住處。鎖門或關門並\ *不*\ 會關閉門口。只有當門口被磚頭砌起來或以其他方式永久封閉時，它才不再算作門口。

   * - The Commentary admits that the “single entrance” factor is not mentioned in the Canon in connection with this rule but is borrowed from the idea of “single enclosure” in the Vibhaṅga to `NP 2`_. It argues, though, that this factor is unavoidably bound up in the concept of “walled and roofed” and illustrates its point as follows: There is a two-room dwelling, composed of an antechamber through which one must pass to get to the inner chamber. A bhikkhu is sleeping in the inner chamber, and an unordained person in the antechamber. Now suppose that a stubborn Vinaya student maintains that if the door between the two rooms is closed, the bhikkhu is sleeping in a separate dwelling from the unordained person, while if the door is open, they are in the same dwelling. His teacher then asks him, “Why are they in the same dwelling if the door is open?”

     - 《義註》承認，在與本戒條相關的《聖典》中沒有提到「單一入口」因素，而是借用了\ `《捨墮》二`_\ 的《經分別》的「單一封閉區域」的概念。不過，它認為這個因素不可避免地與「覆蓋牆壁和覆蓋屋頂」的概念緊密相連，並這樣說明其觀點：有一個兩房間的住宅，由一個前室組成，必須經過前廳才能到達內室。一位比丘在內室睡覺，一位未受具足戒的人在前室。現在假設一位頑固的戒律學生堅持認為，如果兩個房間之間的門關閉，比丘就與未受戒者睡在不同的住處，而如果門打開，他們就在同一個住處。他的老師問他：「如果門開著，為什麼他們會在同一個住處？」

   * - “Because the two rooms share the same roof and walls.”
     - 「因為這兩個房間共用一個屋頂和牆壁。」

   * - “And if the door is closed, does that destroy the roof and walls they had in common?”
     - 「如果門關上了，那是否會破壞他們共同的屋頂和牆壁？」

   * - “No, of course not. But the enclosure in which the bhikkhu is sleeping is marked by the door.”
     - 「不，當然不會。不過比丘睡覺的封閉區域有門作為標記。」

   * - This, the Commentary says, shows that the notion of enclosure is part and parcel of the concept of dwelling, and that the stubborn student has defeated his own argument. Its reasoning here is probably more convincing in Pali than in English—because as we noted above, Pali uses the same word for enclosure and entrance—but even so the illustration does not carry much force when applied to such places as separate apartments in an apartment building and so leaves the issue unsettled as far as they are concerned.

     - 《義註》說，這表明封閉區域的概念是住處概念的一部分，並且固執的學生已經打敗了他自己的論點。這裡的推論在巴利語中可能比在英語中更有說服力——因為正如我們上面提到的，巴利語使用同一個字來表示封閉區域和入口——但即使如此，當應用於公寓大樓中的獨立公寓等地方時，這個例子也沒有太大的說服力，因此就他們而言，問題仍未得到解決。

   * - The Vinaya-mukha notes that the factor introduced by the Commentary has implications that go far beyond the original purpose of this rule—and of the following rule, in which the concept of “single dwelling” is even more important. It suggests borrowing an additional factor from `NP 2`_: the factor of separate residences or zones of ownership (the Pali word *kula* carries both meanings). Thus in a large building composed of separate residences—such as an apartment building, a hotel, or a hospital with private rooms—it suggests that each separate residence count as a separate dwelling.

     - 《戒律入口》指出，《義註》中引入的因素的含義遠遠超出了本戒條的最初目的，也超出了下一條戒條的最初目的，其中「單一住處」的概念更為重要。它建議從\ `《捨墮》二`_\ 借用一個附加因素：單獨住所或所有權區域的因素（巴利語 *kula* 兼具這兩種意義）。因此，在由單獨住所組成的大型建築物中（例如公寓大樓、飯店，或設有私人房間的醫院），它建議每個單獨住所都算作一個單獨住處。

   * - Because the Canon gives no clear guidance on this point, the wise policy for an individual bhikkhu is to follow the views of the Community to which he belongs.
     - 因為《聖典》在這一點上沒有給出明確的指導，所以對於比丘個人來說，明智之舉是遵循他所屬僧團的觀點。

   * - **Nights**
     - **夜晚**

   * - Nights here are counted by dawns. Thus if a bhikkhu is sleeping in the same dwelling with an unordained person but one of them gets up before dawn, that night does not count. If a bhikkhu has been lying down in the same dwelling with an unordained person for two nights running but then skips a night—for example, getting up before dawn at the end of the third night—the consecutive series is broken. (As discussed in `Appendix I`_, *before dawn* here apparently means before dawnrise, i.e., before the beginning of civil twilight.) If he then lies down in the same dwelling with an unordained person the next night, the counting starts again from one.

     - 這裡的夜晚是以\ `黎明（明相）`_\ 來計算的。因此，如果一位比丘與一位未受具足戒的人睡在同一住處，但其中一人在\ `黎明（明相）`_\ 前起床，那麼這個夜晚就不算數。如果一位比丘與一位未受具足戒者連續兩個晚上在同一個住處躺下，但隨後跳過一個晚上——例如，在第三天夜晚結束\ `黎明（明相）`_\ 前起床——連續的系列就被破壞。（如\ `附錄一`_\ 所述，這裡的\ *黎明（明相）前*\ 顯然是指黎明昇起之前，即\ `民用曙暮光`_\ 開始之前。）如果他下一個夜晚與一個未受具足戒的人同一個住處躺下，則重新從一開始計數。

   * - However, once he has been lying down in the same dwelling with an unordained person three nights running, then if after sundown on the fourth night he is lying down in the same dwelling in which a lay person is lying down—even if only for a moment—he incurs a pācittiya.

     - 然而，一旦他已經連續三個夜晚與未受具足戒者在同一住處躺下，那麼如果在第四天夜晚日落之後，他在有在家眾躺著的同一住處躺下 —— 即使只是片刻 —— 他犯《波逸提》。

   * - The Commentary interprets the phrase *after sundown* as meaning any time on the fourth day. In other words, there is no need to wait until the next dawn to count the fourth period of lying down together. As we noted above in the conclusion to the chapter on the saṅghādisesa rules, there was a tendency in the time of the Canon to call a 24-hour period of day and night a “night.” For the purpose of this rule and the following one, this period apparently begins at sundown.

     - 《義註》將「日落之後」一詞解釋為第四天的任何時間。也就是說，不必等到下次\ `黎明（明相）`_\ ，才算第四次一起躺下的週期。正如我們上文《僧殘》戒條篇章結論部分所指出的，在《聖典》時代，人們傾向於將 24 小時的白天和夜晚的週期稱為一個「夜晚」。就本戒條和下一條戒條的目的而言，這一週期顯然從日落時開始。

   * - The Commentary also states that the unordained person need not be the same person each of the four nights, and the same principle holds true for the dwelling. In other words, if a bhikkhu lies down in a dwelling with novice X one night and then goes elsewhere and lies down in a dwelling with layman Y the next night and so on for four nights running, he commits an offense all the same.

     - 《義註》也指出，未受具足戒者不必在四個夜晚都是同一個人，對於住處也適用同樣的原則。換句話說，如果一位比丘一個夜晚與沙彌 X 在一個住處裡躺下，然後下一個夜晚又到別處與俗人 Y 在一住處裡躺下，如此連續四天，他同樣犯了戒。

   * - Perception and intention are not mitigating factors here. Thus a bhikkhu lying down in the same dwelling with a novice whom he thinks to be another bhikkhu commits an offense all the same, as does a bhikkhu who miscounts the nights and lies down in the same room with an unordained person for what he thinks is his third night when it is actually his fourth.

     - 在這裡，感知和意圖並不是減輕懲罰的因素。因此，如果一位比丘與一位他認為是另一名比丘的沙彌在同一個住處躺下，那麼他同樣犯了戒；如果一個比丘算錯了夜晚的數量，與一個沒有受具足戒的人在同一個房間裡躺下，他以為那是他的第三個夜晚，而實際上是第四個夜晚，那麼他同樣犯了戒。

   * - In fact, this is a training rule that one may break without ever realizing it. Suppose a novice comes to lie down in a room where a bhikkhu is sleeping, and then gets up to leave before the bhikkhu awakens. If he does this for four nights running, the bhikkhu incurs a pācittiya even though he may never have been aware of what the novice was doing. Rules like this are the reason why many bhikkhus make a practice of confessing offenses even when they are not consciously aware of having committed them.

     - 事實上，這是一個可能在不知不覺中就違犯的學處。假設一位沙彌來到一位比丘睡覺的房間內躺下，然後在比丘醒來之前起身離開。如果他連續四晚都這樣做，該比丘就犯《波逸提》，儘管他可能根本不知道沙彌在做什麼。正是因為這樣的戒條，使得許多比丘即使在沒有意識到自己已犯下罪行的情況下，也會養成懺悔罪行的習慣。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - To recapitulate some of the points from the above discussion: To lie down with an unordained person in a dwelling that would qualify as grounds for a pācittiya or a dukkaṭa is no offense as long as one does it no more than three days running. If, after lying down in the same dwelling with an unordained person for two nights running, one gets up before dawn at the end of the third night, one may resume lying down in the same dwelling with an unordained person the next night. Also, there is no offense in lying down any number of consecutive nights with an unordained person in a dwelling that would not qualify as grounds for an offense. And, there is no offense if one of the parties is sitting while the other is lying down, or if both parties are sitting (although see `Pc 44`_ & 45_).

     - 重述上述討論中的一些要點：與未受具足戒者躺下，在可構成《波逸提》或《突吉羅》的住處內，只要連續不超過三天，就不犯戒。如果在與未受具足戒者連續兩晚在同一住處躺下之後，第三個夜晚結束黎明前起床，則下一個夜晚可以繼續與未受具足戒者在同一住處躺下。此外，與未受具足戒者在不構成犯戒的住處無論連續幾晚躺下都不構成犯戒。並且，如果一方坐著而另一方躺著，或者雙方都坐著，則不構成犯戒（儘管參見\ `《波逸提》四四`_\ 和\ `四五`_\ ）。

   * - The Vinaya-mukha comments that although this rule as it presently stands no longer fulfills its original purpose, bhikkhus should keep the original purpose in mind and avoid sleeping in the same place with an unordained person whenever possible. It would also be a wise policy to avoid sleeping out in a public park, on a public beach, in an unwalled pavilion, etc., in full view of the public, even though no offense would be involved.

     - 《戒律入口》評論說，儘管本戒條現在已不再符合其原來的目的，但比丘們應該牢記原來的目的，儘可能避免與未受具足戒的人睡在同一個地方。避免露宿在公共公園、公共海灘、沒有圍牆的涼亭等等完全曝露在公眾視線下，也是明智之舉，儘管這並不構成犯戒。

   * - It is also worth noting that this rule encourages bhikkhus to get up and meditate before dawn every day so that they can know for sure they haven’t committed the offense here.

     - 另外值得注意的是，本戒條鼓勵比丘每天\ `黎明（明相）`_\ 前起床禪修，以便他們能確定自己沒有犯下此戒。

   * - *Summary: Lying down at the same time, in the same dwelling, with a novice or layman for more than three nights running is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：與沙彌或俗人超過連續三個夜晚在同一時間、同一住處躺下，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

          *如果任何比丘與女人（在同一住處）一起躺下，波逸提。*

   * - There are only two differences between this rule and the preceding one:
     - 本戒條與前一條戒條只有兩點區別：

   * - 1\) The factor of “object” here is fulfilled only by a female human being, “even one born that day, all the more an older one,” regardless of whether she is related to the bhikkhu.

     - 1）此處「對象」因素僅由女性人類滿足，「即使是當天出生的，更何況年長的」，無論她是否與比丘有親屬關係。

       .. 「即使是當天出生的，更不用提/更別提年長的」

   * - 2\) The four-night clause under “effort” is dropped, which means that the bhikkhu incurs a pācittiya the instant he lies down in the same dwelling with her.

     - 2）刪除「努力」之下的四個夜晚條款，這意味著比丘與她在同一住處躺下時，即犯《波逸提》。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga states that female yakkhas, petas, nāgas, devas, and animals—as well as paṇḍakas (people born neuter or castrated men)—are grounds for a dukkaṭa here. The Commentary qualifies this by saying that *female animal* means one with which it is possible to have intercourse, and the phrase, *female yakkhas, petas, nāgas, and devas*, includes only those who make themselves visible.

     - 《經分別》指出，雌性的夜叉（\ `yakkha`_\ ）、餓鬼（\ `peta`_\ ）、龍（\ `nāga`_\ ）、天神（\ `deva`_\ ）和動物——以及\ `黃門`_\ （\ `paṇḍaka`_\ ，生來就是中性者或被閹割的男性）——在此處則犯《突吉羅》。《義註》對此進行了限定，指出\ *雌性動物*\ 是指可以與之性交的動物，而\ *雌性夜叉、餓鬼、龍和天神*\ 這些詞組僅包括那些讓自己可被看見者。

   * - Even if another man is present in the dwelling, it does not negate the offense.
     - 即使住處內有另一名男子，也不免除犯戒。

   * - Perception as to whether the other person is a woman is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 對於另一方是否為女性的感知並不是減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - Intention is also not a mitigating factor. Thus a bhikkhu lying down in the same dwelling with a woman commits an offense regardless of whether he realizes that she is there.

     - 意圖也不是減輕懲罰的因素。因此，比丘如果與女人在同一住處內躺下，無論他是否意識到女人在那裡，都犯了戒。

   * - The same principles regarding perception and intention also apply to paṇḍakas: A bhikkhu who lies down in the same room with a paṇḍaka whom he thinks to be an ordinary man commits a dukkaṭa; and the same is true for a bhikkhu lying down in a dwelling not knowing that a paṇḍaka is also lying down there.

     - 同樣的關於感知和意圖的原則也適用於\ `黃門`_\ ：如果比丘與他認為是普通男人的\ `黃門`_\ 在同一個房間內躺下，犯《突吉羅》；同樣地，如果一個比丘躺在住處，而不知道有\ `黃門`_\ 也躺在那裡，也犯《突吉羅》。
