   * - As explained in the preceding chapter, this term is most probably related to the verb *pacinati*, “to know,” and means “to be made known” or “to be confessed.” There are 92 rules in this category, divided into eight chapters of ten, and one of twelve.

     - 如同上一章節所解釋的，這個術語很可能與動詞 *pacinati* （「知道」）有關，意思是「須被公開」或「須懺悔」。此類別中有 92 條戒條，分為八品各十條和一品十二條。

   * - A deliberate lie is a statement or gesture made with the aim of misrepresenting the truth to someone else. The K/Commentary, summarizing the long “wheels” in the Vibhaṅga, states that a violation of this rule requires two factors:

     - 故意說謊是為了向別人歪曲事實而做出的言論或動作。 K/《義註》總結了《經分別》中的長「輪」，指出違反此戒條需要兩個因素：

   * - *1) Intention:* the aim to misrepresent the truth; and
     - *1）意圖：*\ 以歪曲事實為目的；和

   * - *2) Effort:* the effort to make another individual know whatever one wants to communicate based on that aim.
     - *2）努力：*\ 為了達到這個目的，努力使另一個人了解自己想要傳達的訊息。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - The aim to misrepresent the truth fulfills this factor regardless of what one’s motives are. Thus “white lies”—made with benevolent intentions (e.g., to a person whose state of mind is too weak to take the truth)—would fall under this rule, so a bhikkhu who wants to shield an emotionally weak person from harsh truths has to be very skillful in phrasing his statements. Also, outrageous lies meant as jokes—to amuse rather than to deceive—would fall under this rule as well, a point we will discuss further in the non-offense section.

     - 無論動機是什麼，歪曲事實的目的都符合這個因素。因此，「善意的謊言」——出於善意而說的謊言（例如，對一個精神狀態太弱而無法接受真相的人說的謊言）——就屬於本戒條，所以，如果比丘想保護一個情感脆弱的人免受殘酷真相的傷害，他就必須非常巧妙地措辭。此外，出於玩笑目的（為了逗樂而不是欺騙）的離譜謊言也屬於本戒條的範疇，我們將在不犯部分進一步討論這一點。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, to misrepresent the truth means to say that one has seen X when one hasn’t, that one hasn’t seen X when one has, or that one has seen X clearly when one is in doubt about the matter. This pattern holds for the other senses—hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation—as well. Thus to repeat what one has heard, seen, etc., even if it actually is misinformation, does not count as a misrepresentation of the truth under this rule, as one is truthfully reporting what one has seen, etc. If, however, one says that one believes in such misinformation—when one actually doesn’t—one’s statement *would* count as a misrepresentation of the truth and so would fulfill this factor.

     - 根據《經分別》，歪曲事實的意思是說，當他沒有看到X時，卻說他看到了它；當他看到了X時，卻說他沒有看到它；或者當他對該事有疑問時，卻說他清楚地看到了X。這種模式也適用於其他感官——聽覺、嗅覺、味覺、觸覺和思考。因此，重複自己所聽到、所看到等內容，即使它實際上是錯誤的信息，也不算本戒條下的歪曲事實，因為是在如實地報道自己所看到等等。然而，如果說自己相信這些錯誤訊息──而實際上自己並不相信──那麼他的話\ *就*\ 算是歪曲了事實，因此就滿足了這個因素。

   * - According to the Commentary, *effort* here covers falsehoods conveyed not only by speech but also by writing or gesture. As for falsehoods conveyed by silence: `Mv.II.3.3`_ states that if, while listening to the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha, one remembers that one has an unconfessed offense and yet remains silent about it, that counts as a deliberate lie; `Mv.II.3.7`_ then goes on to impose a dukkaṭa for this kind of lie, which suggests that remaining silent in a situation where silence conveys a false message does not fulfill this factor for the full offense here.

     - 根據《義註》，這裡的\ *努力*\ 不僅包括透過言語傳達的謊言，還包括透過寫作或示意動作傳達的謊言。至於透過沉默傳達的謊言：\ `《大品》.二.3.3`_\ 規定，如果在聆聽《波羅提木叉》時，想起自己有未懺悔的罪過，但卻保持沉默，那就算是故意撒謊；然後，\ `《大品》.二.3.7`_\ 繼續對這種謊言施加《突吉羅》，這表明在沉默傳達錯誤訊息的情況下保持沉默並不能滿足此處完全違犯的本因素。

   * - Result is not a factor under this rule. Thus whether anyone understands the lie or is deceived by it is irrelevant to the offense.
     - 根據本戒條，結果不是影響因素。因此，是否有人理解謊言或被謊言欺騙，與犯戒無關。

   * - In cases where a particular lie would fall under another rule—such as `Pr 4`_, `Sg 8`_ or 9_, `Pc 13`_, 24_, or 76_\—the penalties assigned by that rule take precedence over the ones assigned here. For instance, making a false but unspecific claim to a superior human state would entail a thullaccaya under `Pr 4`_; falsely accusing another bhikkhu of a pārājika offense would entail a saṅghādisesa under `Sg 8`_; falsely accusing him of a saṅghādisesa would entail a pācittiya under `Pc 76`_; and falsely accusing him of a lesser offense would entail a dukkaṭa under that rule.

     - 當特定謊言屬於另一條戒條時（例如\ `《波羅夷》四`_\ 、\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 或\ `九`_\ 、\ `《波逸提》十三`_\ 、\ `二四`_\ 或\ `七六`_\ ），該戒條指定的懲罰優先於此處指定的懲罰。例如，對上人法作出虛假但不明確的主張，將導致\ `《波羅夷》四`_\ 下的《偷蘭遮》；虛假地指控另一位比丘犯了《波羅夷》罪，將導致\ `《僧殘》八`_\ 下的《僧殘》；虛假地指控他犯《僧殘》，將導致\ `《波逸提》七六`_\ 下的《波逸提》；而根據該戒條，虛假地指控他犯下輕罪，將導致《突吉羅》。

   * - The Vinaya-mukha argues that this rule should take precedence in cases where a particular lie would entail only a dukkaṭa under any of the other rules—as in the last example—but this contradicts the Vibhaṅga.

     - 《戒律入口》認為，當某個謊言根據其他任何戒條只會導致《突吉羅》時（如最後一個例子），本戒條應該優先於其他任何戒條，但這與《經分別》相矛盾。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - A bhikkhu who misrepresents the truth unintentionally commits no offense under this rule. The Vibhaṅga gives two examples: speaking quickly and saying one thing while meaning another. Its word for “quickly”—\ *davāya*\ —can also mean “in fun,” but the Vibhaṅga itself, in a passage unusual for the non-offenses clauses, defines the term, limiting its meaning specifically to “hurriedly.” In doing so, it conforms to a famous passage from `MN 61`_ where the Buddha shows an empty water dipper to Rāhula, his son, telling him that anyone who feels no shame at uttering a deliberate lie is as empty of the virtues of a contemplative as the dipper is empty of water, and then advises Rāhula to train himself: “I will not utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.”

     - 根據本戒條，無意地歪曲事實的比丘並不犯戒。《經分別》舉了兩個例子：說話過快，以及說某件事但意思卻是另一件事。其中表示「快速」的單字 *davāya* 也可以表示「開玩笑」，但《經分別》本身在一段不常見於不犯條款的段落中對該術語進行了定義，將其含義明確限制為「匆忙地」。這樣做符合\ `《中部》61經`_\ 中的著名段落，佛陀向他的兒子羅睺羅展示了一個空水勺，告訴他，如果有人故意撒謊而毫無羞恥，那麼他就缺乏沙門的美德，就像水勺裡沒有水一樣，然後佛陀建議羅睺羅要自我訓練：「我不會故意撒謊，哪怕是為了開玩笑。」

   * - The Commentary explains the Vibhaṅga’s two exemptions as follows: *Speaking quickly* means speaking before one has carefully considered the matter. *Saying one thing while meaning another* means making a slip of the tongue, either out of stupidity or carelessness. It also seconds the Vibhaṅga in not exempting inaccurate statements made in fun from a penalty under this rule. It illustrates this point with several stories that convey a sense of what passed for humor among the less scrupulous bhikkhus of its time. In the first, a novice asks a bhikkhu, “Have you seen my preceptor?” and the bhikkhu, teasing the novice, responds, “Your preceptor’s probably gone, yoked to a firewood-cart.” In the second story, a novice, hearing the yapping of hyenas, asks a bhikkhu, “What’s making that noise?” and the bhikkhu replies, “That’s the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel of the carriage your mother’s going in.” In addition, the Commentary quotes a few statements that today would be classified as exaggeration or sarcasm, saying that these, too, are forbidden by this rule.

     - 《義註》對《經分別》的兩項豁免作如下解釋：\ *說話過快*\ 意味著在仔細考慮事情之前就說話。\ *說某件事但意思卻是另一件事*\ ，意味著由於愚蠢或粗心而說錯話。它也同意《經分別》不免除因玩笑而做出的不準確言論的懲罰。它用幾個故事說明了這一點，這些故事傳達了當時不太嚴謹的比丘們所認為的幽默感。第一個是，一位沙彌問一位比丘：「你見過我的戒師嗎？」比丘就取笑沙彌，回答說：「你的戒師可能被駕到柴車上走了。」在第二個故事中，一位沙彌聽到鬣狗的吠叫聲，便問一位比丘：「是什麼發出了這種聲音？」比丘回答說：「那是那些抬起你母親所乘車輛陷在泥裡的車輪的人發出的聲音。」此外，《義註》也引用了一些在今天看來會被視為誇張或諷刺的言論，並表示這些言論也是本戒條所禁止的。

   * - Whatever humor these jokes originally contained has been so dulled by time that the statements now seem obviously unworthy of a bhikkhu. A bhikkhu at present whose sense of humor tends toward misrepresentation and exaggeration would do well to develop a similar perspective on his own jokes. This is not to deny the value or potential wisdom of humor; simply to note that a bhikkhu’s sense of humor should be kept in service to his values, and that the most memorable wit is memorable precisely because it tells the straight truth.

     - 這些笑話原本包含的任何幽默，已經隨著時間的流逝而變得如此暗淡，以至於這些話現在看起來顯然不適合比丘說。目前，如果一位比丘的幽默感傾向於扭曲和誇張，他最好對自己的笑話培養類似的看法。這並不是否認幽默的價值或潛在的智慧；只是要注意，比丘的幽默感應該服務於他的價值觀，最令人難忘的智慧之所以令人難忘，正是因為它說出了直截了當的事實。

   * - As we noted above, a bhikkhu who speaks from mistaken assumptions—truthfully reporting any mistaken information he may have received or mistaken beliefs he may have thought up—does not come under this rule.

     - 正如我們上面提到的，如果比丘基於錯誤的假設而講話——如實報告他可能收到的任何錯誤訊息或他可能想到的錯誤信念——則不犯本戒條。

   * - **Broken promises**
     - **違背承諾**

   * - `Mv.III.14.1-14`_ imposes a dukkaṭa on the act of making a promise with pure intentions but later breaking it. Because the texts make no mention of any circumstances beyond one’s control that would exempt one from that penalty, a bhikkhu should be very careful of how he states his plans for the future. A special instance of breaking a promise—accepting an invitation to a meal but then not going—is treated, not under `Mv.III.14.1-14`_, but under `Pc 33`_.

     - `《大品》.三.14.1-14`_\ 對出於純潔意圖作出承諾但後來卻違背承諾的行為施加《突吉羅》。因為文獻中沒有提到任何超出個人控制範圍的情況可以免除這種懲罰，所以比丘應該對如何陳述他對未來的計劃非常小心。違背承諾的一個特殊例子——接受了用餐邀請但後來卻不去——不是在\  `《大品》.三.14.1-14`_\ 中處理，而是在\ `《波逸提》三三`_\ 中處理。

   * - *Summary: The intentional effort to misrepresent the truth to another individual is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：故意向他人扭曲事實，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*
