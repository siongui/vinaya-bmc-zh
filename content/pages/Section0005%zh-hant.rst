   * - THIS VOLUME is the first in a two-volume book that attempts to give an organized, detailed account of the Vinaya training rules and the traditions that have grown up around them. The Pāṭimokkha training rules as explained in the Sutta Vibhaṅga are the topic of the first volume; the rules found in the Khandhakas, the topic of the second. The book as a whole is aimed primarily at those whose lives are affected by the rules—bhikkhus who live by them, and other people who have dealings with the bhikkhus—so that they will be able to find gathered in one location as much essential information as possible on just what the rules do and do not entail. Students of Early Buddhism, Theravādin history, or contemporary Theravādin issues should also find this book interesting, as should anyone who is serious about the practice of the Dhamma and wants to see how the Buddha worked out the ramifications of Dhamma practice in daily life.

       .. TODO: on just what the rules do and do not entail 翻譯？

     - 本冊是兩冊書中的第一冊，試圖對戒律訓練規則以及圍繞這些規則形成的傳統進行有條理、詳細的描述。《經分別》中所解釋的《波羅提木叉》訓練規則是第一冊的主題；第二冊主題的是《犍度》中的規則。整本書主要針對那些生活受到戒律影響的人——遵守戒律的比丘，以及其他與比丘打交道的人——以便他們能夠在一個地方找到盡可能多的必要訊息，關於規則涉及什麼和不涉及什麼。研究早期佛教、上座部歷史或當代上座部議題的學生也應該會發現這本書很有趣，任何認真修行佛法，並想了解佛陀如何闡述在日常生活中佛法修行果報的人也會如此發現。

   * - The amount of information offered here is both the book’s strength and its weakness. On the one hand, it encompasses material that in some cases is otherwise unavailable in English or even in romanized Pali, and should be sufficient to serve as a life-long companion to any bhikkhu who seriously wants to benefit from the precise and thorough training the rules have to offer. On the other hand, the sheer size of the book and the mass of details to be remembered might prove daunting or discouraging to anyone just embarking on the bhikkhu’s life.

     - 這裡提供的資訊量既是本書的優點，也是它的缺點。一方面，它包含了在某些情況下無法用英文甚至羅馬化巴利文獲得的材料，並且應該足以作為任何認真希望從戒條能提供的精確而徹底的修行訓練中受益的比丘的終生伴侶。另一方面，這本書的龐大篇幅和需要記住的大量細節可能會讓任何剛開始比丘生活的人感到害怕或沮喪。

   * - To overcome this drawback, I have tried to organize the material in as clear-cut a manner as possible. In particular, in volume one I have analyzed each rule into its component factors so as to show not only the rule’s precise range but also how it connects to the general pattern of mindfully analyzing one’s own actions in terms of such factors as intention, perception, object, effort, and result—a system that plays an important role in the training of the mind. In volume two, I have gathered rules by subject so as to give a clear sense of how rules scattered randomly in the texts actually relate to one another in a coherent way.

     - 為了克服這個缺點，我嘗試以盡可能明確的方式組織材料。特別是，在第一冊中，我將每條規則分析為其組成因素，以便不僅顯示該規則的精確範圍，而且還顯示它如何與正念地分析自己行動的一般模式連結起來，根據意圖(intention)、感知(perception)、對象(object)、努力(effort)和結果(result)等因素——一個在心智訓練中發揮重要作用的系統。在第二冊中，我按主題收集了規則，以便清楚地了解文本中隨機散佈的規則實際上如何以連貫的方式相互關聯。
