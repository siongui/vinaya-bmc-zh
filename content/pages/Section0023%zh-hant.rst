          *Should any bhikkhu, admonished by the bhikkhus in accordance with a rule, say, “Friends, I will not train myself under this training rule until I have put questions about it to another bhikkhu, competent and learned in the discipline,” it is to be confessed. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu in training should understand, should ask, should ponder. This is the proper course here.*

          *若有比丘被比丘們如法勸誡時，說：「朋友們，在向另一位精通戒律、學識淵博的比丘請教之前，我不會按照此學處訓練自己。」，波逸提。諸比丘，修行中的比丘應當理解、應當提問、應當思考。這於此是如法的。*

   * - This rule deals with cases where a bhikkhu tries to excuse himself from following any of the training rules without showing out-and-out disrespect for the rule or the person admonishing him. (If he showed out-and-out disrespect, the case would come under Pc 54.) The factors for the full offense here are three.

     - 這條戒條處理的是比丘試圖為自己不遵守任何學處找藉口，但又未表現出對戒條或對其訓誡者的徹底不尊重的情況。（如果他表現出徹底的不尊重，則該情況適用\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 。）構成完全違犯的因素有三。

          *1) Object:* One has been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya.

          *1）對象：*\ 受到一位比丘同儕的訓誡，且他引用了律藏中所制定的戒條。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Intention:* One does not want to train oneself in line with the rule.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）意圖：*\ 不想按照戒條訓練自己。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *3) Effort:* As a ploy to excuse oneself, one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *3）努力：*\ 做為給自己找藉口的花招，說了些話達到不按照戒條訓練的效果。

   * - Only two of these factors—object and effort—require explanation.
     - 這三個因素中，只有兩個——對象和努力——需要解釋。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The explanation for this factor is exactly the same as under `Pc 54`_. Perception as to whether the person giving the admonishment is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).

     - 對於這一因素的解釋與\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 完全相同。對給予訓誡者是否受過具足戒的感知與犯戒無關（參見\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - Looking at the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of this factor, it would appear to cover only cases where one used the precise words mentioned in the training rule, but the K/Commentary—drawing probably on the Great Standards—expands it to cover any case where one says something as a ploy to excuse oneself from following the rule without showing disrespect. Examples might include: “I’ll worry about that rule when I come to it.” “I don’t have time for that right now.” “I’ve been wondering: Do you really think that that rule applies in this day and age? It gets in the way of our spreading the Dhamma.” In other words, this factor closes any loopholes left by `Pc 54`_.

     - 從《經分別》對此因素的討論來看，它看起來只涵蓋了使用學處中被提及的明確措辭的情況，但 K/《義註》——可能藉鑑了《四大教示》——將其擴展至涵蓋任何說了些話做為花招，在不顯得不尊重的情況下，為自己不遵守戒條找藉口的情況。例如可能包括：「那條戒條我到時候再說吧。」「我現在沒時間做那件事。」「我一直在想：你真的認為那條戒條在今天的時代還適用嗎？它阻礙了我們弘揚佛法。」換句話說，這一因素彌補了\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 留下的任何漏洞。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, the only way to avoid an offense in situations like this is to say that one will learn about the rule and train in line with it. As the non-offense clauses to Pc 54 make clear, though, if one has been admonished with any interpretation of a rule that differs from one’s teachers’, one may avoid an offense simply by stating that one’s teachers taught differently.

     - 根據《經分別》，在這種情況下避免犯戒的唯一方法是表示會學習戒條並遵照其來訓練。然而，正如\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 的不犯條款所明確指出的，如果因對戒條的解釋與導師的解釋不同而受到訓誡，則只需說明導師教導得不同，即可避免犯戒。

   * - *Summary: When being admonished by another bhikkhu with regard to a training rule formulated in the Vinaya, saying something as a ploy to excuse oneself from training under the rule is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：當因律藏中制定的學處而被另一位比丘訓誡時，以某種藉口耍花招逃避該戒條下的訓練，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*
