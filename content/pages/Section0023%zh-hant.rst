          *Should any bhikkhu, admonished by the bhikkhus in accordance with a rule, say, “Friends, I will not train myself under this training rule until I have put questions about it to another bhikkhu, competent and learned in the discipline,” it is to be confessed. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu in training should understand, should ask, should ponder. This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *若有比丘被比丘們如法勸誡時，說：「朋友們，在向另一位精通戒律、學識淵博的比丘請教之前，我不會按照此學處訓練自己。」，波逸提。諸比丘，修行中的比丘應當理解、應當提問、應當思考。這於此是如法的。*

   * - This rule deals with cases where a bhikkhu tries to excuse himself from following any of the training rules without showing out-and-out disrespect for the rule or the person admonishing him. (If he showed out-and-out disrespect, the case would come under Pc 54.) The factors for the full offense here are three.

     - 這條戒條處理的是比丘試圖為自己不遵守任何學處找藉口，但又未表現出對戒條或對其訓誡者的徹底不尊重的情況。（如果他表現出徹底的不尊重，則該情況適用\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 。）構成完全違犯的因素有三。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Object:* One has been admonished by a fellow bhikkhu who cites a rule formulated in the Vinaya.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *1）對象：*\ 受到一位比丘同儕的訓誡，且他引用了律藏中所制定的戒條。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *2) Intention:* One does not want to train oneself in line with the rule.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）意圖：*\ 不想按照戒條訓練自己。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *3) Effort:* As a ploy to excuse oneself, one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *3）努力：*\ 做為給自己找藉口的花招，說了些話達到不按照戒條訓練的效果。

   * - Only two of these factors—object and effort—require explanation.
     - 這三個因素中，只有兩個——對象和努力——需要解釋。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The explanation for this factor is exactly the same as under `Pc 54`_. Perception as to whether the person giving the admonishment is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).

     - 對於這一因素的解釋與\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 完全相同。對給予訓誡者是否受過具足戒的感知與犯戒無關（參見\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - Looking at the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of this factor, it would appear to cover only cases where one used the precise words mentioned in the training rule, but the K/Commentary—drawing probably on the Great Standards—expands it to cover any case where one says something as a ploy to excuse oneself from following the rule without showing disrespect. Examples might include: “I’ll worry about that rule when I come to it.” “I don’t have time for that right now.” “I’ve been wondering: Do you really think that that rule applies in this day and age? It gets in the way of our spreading the Dhamma.” In other words, this factor closes any loopholes left by `Pc 54`_.

     - 從《經分別》對此因素的討論來看，它看起來只涵蓋了使用學處中被提及的明確措辭的情況，但 K/《義註》——可能藉鑑了《四大教示》——將其擴展至涵蓋任何說了些話做為花招，在不顯得不尊重的情況下，為自己不遵守戒條找藉口的情況。例如可能包括：「那條戒條我到時候再說吧。」「我現在沒時間做那件事。」「我一直在想：你真的認為那條戒條在今天的時代還適用嗎？它阻礙了我們弘揚佛法。」換句話說，這一因素彌補了\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 留下的任何漏洞。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - According to the Vibhaṅga, the only way to avoid an offense in situations like this is to say that one will learn about the rule and train in line with it. As the non-offense clauses to Pc 54 make clear, though, if one has been admonished with any interpretation of a rule that differs from one’s teachers’, one may avoid an offense simply by stating that one’s teachers taught differently.

     - 根據《經分別》，在這種情況下避免犯戒的唯一方法是表示會學習戒條並遵照其來訓練。然而，正如\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 的不犯條款所明確指出的，如果因對戒條的解釋與導師的解釋不同而受到訓誡，則只需說明導師教導得不同，即可避免犯戒。

   * - *Summary: When being admonished by another bhikkhu with regard to a training rule formulated in the Vinaya, saying something as a ploy to excuse oneself from training under the rule is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *摘要：當因律藏中制定的學處而被另一位比丘訓誡時，以某種藉口耍花招逃避該戒條下的訓練，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

          *Should any bhikkhu, when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited, say, “Why are these lesser and minor training rules recited when they lead only to anxiety, bother, and confusion?” the criticism of the training rules is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *在誦讀《波羅提木叉》時，若任何比丘說：「這些細小的、次要的學處（小小戒）只會導致焦慮、煩擾和困惑，為何還要誦讀呢？」對學處的批評，波逸提。*

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time the Blessed One, phrasing it in many ways, gave a talk on discipline to the bhikkhus. He spoke in praise of discipline, in praise of the mastery of discipline, and in praise of Ven. Upāli, referring to him again and again. The bhikkhus (said), ‘… Come, friends, let’s study discipline with Ven. Upāli.’ They and many other bhikkhus—elders, newly ordained, and those in between—studied discipline with Ven. Upāli.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「\ `其時，世尊以種種方便向比丘們講述了戒律。 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0192a03>`_\ 他讚揚戒律，讚揚精通戒律，並讚揚優婆離尊者，多次提及他。比丘們（說）：『……來吧，朋友們，讓我們跟隨優婆離尊者學習戒律。』他們和許多其他比丘——上座、下座以及中座跟隨優婆離尊者學習戒律。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then the thought occurred to some group-of-six bhikkhus: ‘Now, friends, many bhikkhus… are studying discipline with Ven. Upāli. If they become well versed in the discipline, they will push us and pull us around in whatever way they like, however they like, and as long as they like. Come, friends, let’s criticize the discipline.’ Then the group-of-six bhikkhus, going to the bhikkhus, said, ‘Why are these lesser and minor training rules repeated when they lead only to anxiety, bother, and confusion?’”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「這時，有六群比丘想到：『現在，朋友們，許多比丘…都在跟隨優婆離尊者學習戒律。如果他們精通戒律，就會隨心所欲地擺佈我們，想怎麼擺佈就怎麼擺佈，想擺佈多久就多久。來吧，朋友們，讓我們批評這些戒律。』然後，這六群比丘走到其他比丘面前，說：『這些細小的、次要的學處（小小戒），只會帶來焦慮、煩擾和困惑，為什麼還要反覆強調呢？』」

   * - The full offense here has three factors.
     - 此處的完全違犯有三個因素。

   * - *1) Effort:* One criticizes the discipline in the presence
     - *1）努力：*\ 有人在場時批評戒律

   * - *2) Object:* of another bhikkhu
     - *2）對象：*\ 當著另一位比丘的面

   * - *3) Intention:* with the intent of disparaging it.
     - *3）意圖：*\ 意圖貶低它。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga explains *criticizing the discipline* with a list of examples. In addition to the statement in the rule, the list includes such statements as, “Those who master this suffer anxiety, bother, and confusion. Those who don’t master this suffer no anxiety, bother, or confusion. It would be better (§) if this were not repeated. It would be better (§) if this were not learned. It would be better (§) if this were not mastered. It would be better (§) if this were not borne in mind. May the discipline disappear or may these bhikkhus not be well-versed in this.” This last sentence sounds less like a criticism and more like a possible motivation for one’s criticism—a typical ambiguity in the style of the Pali Canon—but none of the commentaries discuss this point.

     - 《經分別》列舉了例子來解釋\ *批評戒律*\ 。除了戒條本身的陳述外，列舉的例子還包括：「掌握此者，會感到焦慮、煩擾和困惑。未掌握此者，則不會感到焦慮、煩擾和困惑。最好（§）這不被重複。最好（§）這不被學習。最好（§）這不被掌握。最好（§）這不被銘記在心。願戒律消失，或願這些比丘對此不甚精通。」最後這句話與其說是批評，不如說是批評的可能動機——這是巴利《聖典》風格中典型的含糊不清之處——但沒有任何註釋書討論過這一點。

   * - The training rule would seem to indicate that these actions are grounds for an offense only while the Pāṭimokkha is being recited or rehearsed, but the non-offense clauses in the Vibhaṅga give no allowance to criticize the discipline at other times, and the K/Commentary follows the Vibhaṅga in not making the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha a necessary factor for the offense here. In other words, the factor of effort here is fulfilled if one criticizes the discipline at any time.

     - 此學處似乎表明，只有在誦讀或練習《波羅提木叉》時，這些行為才構成犯戒；但《經分別》中的不犯條款並未允許在其他時間批評戒律， K/《義註》也遵循《經分別》，認為誦讀《波羅提木叉》並非構成此處犯戒的必要條件。換言之，只要在任何時候批評戒律，就滿足了此處「努力」因素。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - There is a pācittiya for criticizing the discipline in the presence of a bhikkhu; and a dukkaṭa for criticizing any other Dhamma in his presence, or criticizing either the discipline or any other Dhamma in the presence of an unordained person. Perception as to whether one’s listener is ordained is irrelevant to the offense (see `Pc 42`_).

     - 在比丘面前批評戒律，犯《波逸提》；在比丘面前批評其他佛法，或在未受具足戒者面前批評戒律或其他佛法，犯《突吉羅》。聽者是否受具足戒的感知與犯戒無關（參閱\ `《波逸提》四二`_\ ）。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - This factor is fulfilled when one’s intention is to disparage the discipline. Given the way “effort” is defined above, this factor might seem superfluous, but the non-offense clauses give an example of an effort that may sound like criticism but is not actually meant to be taken as disparagement. The Commentary defines the factor of intention here as the desire to give rise to skepticism *(vimati)* about the discipline in the listener’s mind.

     - 當意圖是貶低戒律時，這個因素就成立了。鑑於上文對「努力」的定義，這一因素可能似乎顯得多餘，但不犯條款舉例說明了這樣一種努力：它聽起來像是批評，但實際上並非意在貶低。《義註》將此處的意圖因素定義為：意欲在聽者心中引發對戒律的懷疑\ *（vimati）*\ 。

   * - **Further action**
     - **進一步行動**

   * - A bhikkhu who makes a concerted effort to speak in dispraise of the Dhamma or discipline may be subject to an act of censure or banishment, depending on the seriousness of the case (Cv.I.4.1; `Cv.I.14.2`_). (See `BMC2, Chapter 20`_.)

     - 比丘若蓄意詆毀佛法或戒律，可受呵責（羯磨）或驅出（羯磨），視情節嚴重程度而定（\ `《小品》.一.4.1`_\ ；\ `《小品》.一.14.2`_\ ）。（參見\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十章`_\ 。）

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - There is no offense if, without intending to criticize the discipline, one suggests to another person that he/she master the suttas, the gāthās (verses), or the Abhidhamma first, before mastering the discipline.

     - 如果無意批評戒律，建議另一個人先掌握經文、偈頌或阿毘達摩，然後再掌握戒律，並不構成犯戒。

   * - *Summary: Criticizing the discipline in the presence of another bhikkhu, in hopes of making him skeptical about the discipline or its study, is a pācittiya offense.*
     - *總結：當著另一位比丘的面批評戒律，希望使他懷疑戒律或其研讀，是《波逸提》（《單墮》）罪。*

          *Should any bhikkhu, when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited every half-month, say, “Just now have I learned that this case, too, is handed down in the Pāṭimokkha, is included in the Pāṭimokkha, and comes up for recitation every half-month”; and if the bhikkhus should know of that bhikkhu, “This bhikkhu has already sat through two or three recitations of the Pāṭimokkha, if not more,” the bhikkhu is not exempted for being ignorant. Whatever the offense he has committed, he is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule; and in addition, his deceit is to be exposed: “It is no gain for you, friend, it is ill-done, that when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited, you do not pay attention, properly taking it to heart.” As for the deception (§), it is to be confessed.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *若任何比丘在每半月誦讀《波羅提木叉》時說：「我剛剛才知道，此情況也記載於《波羅提木叉》內，包含於《波羅提木叉》內，且每半月誦讀一次」；且如果比丘們知道那位比丘，「這位比丘已經坐著聽了兩、三遍《波羅提木叉》的誦讀，甚至更多。」，該比丘也不能因為無知而免於懲罰。無論他犯了何種罪過，都應按照戒條處置；此外，還應揭露他的欺騙行為：「朋友，誦讀《波羅提木叉》時，你不專心、不牢記於心，對你並無益處，而且是糟糕的做法。」至於欺騙（§），波逸提。*

   * - To summarize the Vibhaṅga: If a bhikkhu—when the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha comes to a rule he has violated—tries to excuse himself through the sort of pretence cited in the rule, he immediately incurs a dukkaṭa if he has already listened to the Pāṭimokkha in full three times or more. The other bhikkhus may then expose his deception by means of a Community transaction (see `Appendix VIII`_). If he then continues with the pretence, he incurs a pācittiya. If they do not enact a transaction against him, though, he incurs a dukkaṭa for each effort he makes in keeping up the pretence. There is no offense, though, if he is not feigning ignorance or if he has not yet heard the Pāṭimokkha in full at least three times.

     - 綜合《經分別》所述：若比丘在誦讀《波羅提木叉》時，遇到自己已違反的戒條，並試圖以戒條中所列的藉口為自己開脫，若他已完整聆聽過《波羅提木叉經》三遍或以上，則立即犯《突吉羅》。其他比丘則可藉由僧團羯磨（見\ `附錄八`_\ ）揭穿其欺騙。若他繼續其虛偽藉口，犯《波逸提》。但若他們不對其施以羯磨，則他每努力一次維持其虛偽藉口，犯一次《突吉羅》。但若他並非裝無知，或尚未完整聆聽《波羅提木叉》至少三遍，則不犯戒。

   * - Obviously, these explanations were formulated when Pali was the bhikkhus’ native language, and the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha in Pali offered the opportunity to learn the rules, along with the opportunity to feign ignorance without telling an out-and-out lie. In other words, one could say immediately after the recitation of a particular rule, “Just now have I heard that this rule is in the Pāṭimokkha,” and strictly speaking it would be true: One *has* just heard it, even if for the umpteenth time, but one hopes that the other bhikkhus will be deceived into inferring that one has just heard it for the first time.

     - 顯然，這些解釋是在巴利語是比丘母語的時代形成的。用巴利語誦讀《波羅提木叉》既提供了學習戒條的機會，也提供了在不徹底撒謊的情況下假裝無知的機會。換句話說，可以在誦讀一條戒條後立即說：「我剛才聽到這條戒條在《波羅提木叉》裡。」嚴格來說，這確實是真的：他剛剛\ *才*\ 聽到它，即使是第無數次聽到，但希望其他比丘會被蒙蔽，誤以為他是第一次聽到。

   * - However, the discussion of this rule in the Vibhaṅga and commentaries makes no exceptions for bhikkhus whose native language is not Pali. Nevertheless, as the Pāṭimokkha is available in a number of translations, the grace period in which one is expected to be ignorant—three recitations covers at least a month to a month and a half—is not too short a time for a new bhikkhu to read and remember the rules in translation.

     - 然而，《經分別》及註釋書中對這條戒條的討論並未對母語非巴利語的比丘做出例外規定。儘管如此，《波羅提木叉》已有多種譯本，因此，對於一位新比丘而言，這段允許其無知的寬限期——三次誦讀至少涵蓋一個月到一個半月——並不算短，足以讓他閱讀並記住譯本中的戒條。

   * - It is also worth noting that the non-offense clauses do not make an exception for a bhikkhu who tries a similar ploy to feign ignorance of the rules outside of the time when the Pāṭimokkha is being formally recited, and the K/Commentary—as under the preceding rule—follows the Vibhaṅga in not making the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha a necessary factor for the offense here. In other words, this rule covers the use of a half-truth to feign ignorance of the rules at *any* time.

     - 值得注意的是，不犯條款並未對試圖在正式誦讀《波羅提木叉》之外的時間裡，以類似伎倆假裝不知戒條的比丘做出例外規定。 K/《義註》──如同前一條戒條一樣──遵循《經分別》，並未將誦讀《波羅提木叉》作為構成此處犯戒的必要條件。換言之，此戒條涵蓋了在\ *任何*\ 時候以半真半假之言假裝不知戒條。

   * - The factors for the full offense here are three.
     - 此處構成完全違犯的因素有三點。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *1) Object:* a rule in the Pāṭimokkha.

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *2）意圖：*\ 想要欺騙比丘相信自己對所違反的戒條一無所知。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          *3) Effort:* One has heard the Pāṭimokkha in full for at least three times, yet one persists in saying half-truths to feign ignorance after the bhikkhus have enacted a Community transaction exposing one’s deceit. (Out-and-out lies would come under `Pc 1`_.)

     - .. container:: mx-2

          *3）努力：*\ 至少三次完整地聽過《波羅提木叉》，但在比丘們透過僧團羯磨揭穿其欺騙行為後，仍然堅持說半真半假的話來假裝無知。（徹頭徹尾的謊言屬於\ `《波逸提》一`_\ 。）

   * - Perception as to the transaction’s validity is not a mitigating factor here. If the transaction exposing one’s deceit has been properly carried out, then regardless of whether one perceives it as valid, one incurs a pācittiya for trying to deceive the bhikkhus any further. If it has been improperly carried out, one incurs a dukkaṭa for trying to deceive them further, regardless of how one perceives the transaction.

     - 對羯磨有效性的感知並非減輕懲罰的因素。如果揭穿欺騙行為的羯磨已妥善執行，那麼無論是否認為其有效，若試圖進一步欺騙比丘們，都犯《波逸提》。如果羯磨執行不當，無論如何看待羯磨，若試圖進一步欺騙比丘們，都犯《突吉羅》。
