          *Should any bhikkhu pick up or have (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable, except in a monastery or in a dwelling, it is to be confessed. But when a bhikkhu has picked up or had (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable (left) in a monastery or in a dwelling, he is to keep it, (thinking,) “Whoever it belongs to will (come and) fetch it.” This is the proper course here.*

          *如果任何比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起一件貴重物品或被認為是貴重物品，除了在寺院或住所內，波逸提。但是，當比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起寺院或住所中（被遺留下）的貴重物品或被視為貴重物品時，他應收藏它，（思考）「無論它屬於誰，都會（過來）拿它。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The general purpose of this rule is to prevent a bhikkhu from picking up misplaced valuables belonging to other people, for as the origin story shows, there are dangers inherent in such an act even when done with the best intentions.

     - 本戒條的總體目的是防止比丘撿起屬於其他人的遺失的貴重物品，因為正如起源故事所示，即使是出於最好的意圖，這種行為也存在固有的危險。
