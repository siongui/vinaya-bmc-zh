          *Should any bhikkhu pick up or have (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable, except in a monastery or in a dwelling, it is to be confessed. But when a bhikkhu has picked up or had (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable (left) in a monastery or in a dwelling, he is to keep it, (thinking,) “Whoever it belongs to will (come and) fetch it.” This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起一件貴重物品或被認為是貴重物品，除了在寺院或住所內，波逸提。但是，當比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起寺院或住所中（被遺留下）的貴重物品或被視為貴重物品時，他應收藏它，（思考）「無論它屬於誰，都會（過來）拿它。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The general purpose of this rule is to prevent a bhikkhu from picking up misplaced valuables belonging to other people, for as the origin story shows, there are dangers inherent in such an act even when done with the best intentions.

     - 本戒條的總體目的是防止比丘撿起屬於其他人的遺失的貴重物品，因為正如\ `起源故事 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0218a03>`_\ 所示，即使是出於最好的意圖，這種行為也存在固有的危險。

          “Now at that time a certain bhikkhu was bathing in the Aciravatī River. And a certain brahman, having placed a bag of 500 gold pieces on the river bank, bathed in the river and left, forgetting it. The bhikkhu, (saying to himself,) ‘Don’t let this bag of the brahman’s be lost,’ picked it up. Then the brahman, remembering, rushed back and said to the bhikkhu, ‘My good man, have you seen my bag?’

          「爾時，有一位比丘正在阿致羅筏底河沐浴。某一位婆羅門，將一袋五百金幣放在河岸上，沐浴在河中，忘記它而離去。比丘（自言自語）『不要讓這個婆羅門的袋子丟失』，把它撿起來。這時，婆羅門想起來了，衝回來對比丘說：『善男子，你看到我的袋子了嗎？』

          “‘Here you are, brahman,’ he said, and gave it to him.

          「『給你，婆羅門，』他說，把它交給了他。

          “Then the thought occurred to the brahman, ‘Now by what means can I get away without giving a reward to this bhikkhu?’ So (saying,) ‘I didn’t have 500, my good man, I had 1,000!’ he detained him for a while and then let him go.”

     - .. container:: px-4

          「然後，婆羅門想到，『現在我怎麼能不給這位比丘報酬而逃脫呢？』所以（說）『我沒有 500 ，善男子，我有 1,000 ！』拘留了他一段時間，然後就放了他。」

   * - However, a bhikkhu who comes across a fallen valuable in a monastery or in a dwelling he is visiting—if he does not pick it up—may later be held responsible if it gets lost: thus the two situations mentioned as exemptions in the rule. In situations such as these, a bhikkhu is allowed even to pick up money and other items he is not normally allowed to take. In fact, the Vinaya-mukha states that if he does *not* pick up the valuable and put it in safe-keeping, he incurs a dukkaṭa. None of the other texts mention this point, although it is probably justified on the grounds that the bhikkhu is neglecting his duty in not following the “proper course” here.

     - 然而，比丘在寺院或他所拜訪的住處中發現掉落的貴重物品，如果他沒有撿起來，之後如果丟失的話，可能要承擔責任：因此，戒條中提到的兩種情況是豁免的。在這類情況下，比丘甚至可以拿走金錢和其他他通常不被允許拿走的物品。事實上，《戒律入口》指出，如果他\ *不*\撿起貴重物品並將其妥善保管，他犯《突吉羅》。其他文獻都沒有提到這一點，儘管這可能是合理的，因為比丘在這裡沒有遵循「適當的方針」而忽視了他的職責。

   * - The Vibhaṅga advises that if a bhikkhu has picked up a fallen valuable in this way and put it in safe keeping, he should take note of its features. (The Commentary adds that if it is a bag of money, he should open the bag and count how much it contains. The same would hold for such things as wallets at present.) He should then have an announcement made, “Let him come whose goods are lost.” If a person comes to claim the item, the bhikkhu should ask him/her to describe it. If the person describes it correctly, the bhikkhu should hand it over. If not, he should tell the person to “keep looking.” If the bhikkhu is going to leave the monastery to live elsewhere, he should entrust the item to another bhikkhu or—if no suitable bhikkhu is available—to a suitable lay person (§).

     - 《經分別》建議，如果比丘以這種方式撿起掉落的貴重物品並將其妥善保管，他應該記下它的特徵。（《義註》補充說，如果是一袋金錢，他應該打開袋子數一下裡面有多少錢。在目前，錢包之類的東西也應如此做。）然後他應該宣布：「誰的東西丟了請過來。」如果有人來領取物品，比丘應該請他/她描述它。如果此人描述正確，比丘應該交給他。如果不正確，他應該告訴這個人「繼續尋找」。如果比丘要離開寺院到其他地方居住，他應該將物品託付給另一位比丘，或者－－如果沒有合適的比丘－－託付給合適的在家人（§）。

   * - The Commentary adds that if, after a suitable length of time, no one comes to claim the item, the bhikkhu should have it exchanged for something of lasting use to the monastery. If, after that, the owner does come to claim the item, the bhikkhu should tell him/her of the use to which it was put. If the owner is satisfied, there is no problem. If not, the bhikkhu should arrange to have the owner compensated. However, as we noted in the discussion of compensation under `Pr 2`_, the Canon imposes only one potential penalty on a bhikkhu in a situation such as this: The Community, if it sees fit, can force him to apologize to the owner (`Cv.I.20`_; see `BMC2, Chapter 20`_).

     - 《義註》補充說，如果在一段適當的時間後，沒有人來領取該物品，比丘應該將其換成對寺院持久使用的東西。如果之後，所有者真的來領取該物品，比丘應該告訴他/她該物品的用途。如果所有者滿意的話就沒有問題。如果不滿意，比丘應該安排對所有者進行補償。然而，正如我們在討論\ `《波羅夷》二`_\ 下的賠償時所指出的，在這種情況下，《聖典》只對比丘施加一種潛在的處罰：如果僧團認為合適，可以強迫他向所有者道歉（\ `《小品》.一.20`_\；見\ `《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第二十章`_\）。

   * - The factors for the offense here are four.
     - 這裡的犯戒因素有四個。

   * - *1) Object:* a valuable or anything considered a valuable that one finds left behind, except in a monastery or a dwelling that one is visiting.
     - *1）對象：*\發現留下的有價值的東西或任何被認為有價值的東西，除了在拜訪的寺院或住處中。

   * - *2) Perception:* One does not perceive it as discarded.
     - *2）感知：*\不認為它是被丟棄的。

   * - *3) Intention:* One wants to keep it in safe keeping for the owner.
     - *3）意圖：*\希望為所有者保管它。

   * - *4) Effort:* One picks it up or has someone else pick it up.
     - *4）努力：*\自己撿起或讓別人撿起。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines a *valuable* as jewels, gold, or silver. At present, money would be included here. *What is considered a valuable* means anything that people use or consume. Items meeting these definitions at present would include wallets, watches, keys, eyeglasses, cameras, etc.

     - 《經分別》將\ *有價值的物品*\定義為珠寶、黃金或白銀。目前，金錢也包含在這裡。\ *被認為有價值的東西*\是指人們使用或消費的任何東西。目前符合這些定義的物品包括錢包、手錶、鑰匙、眼鏡、相機等。

   * - According to the K/Commentary, the object has to belong to someone else to fulfill the factor of effort here. The Vibhaṅga does not state this point explicitly, but it does make the point implicitly with the activities it discusses under this rule: putting an item in safe keeping, quizzing those who come to claim it, taking an item on trust, borrowing it. These are all activities that pertain to the belongings of others, and not to one’s own belongings. The K/Commentary adds that if the owner has given one permission to take the article, it does not fulfill the factor of object here. This comment has to be qualified, of course, by noting that if the item is a valuable, then taking it would involve an offense under another rule.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，物品必須屬於其他人才能滿足此處的努力因素。《經分別》沒有明確說明這一點，但它確實透過在本戒條下討論的活動隱含地表達了這一點：妥善保管一件物品，詢問那些前來索取它的人，託付一件物品，借用它。這些都是與他人的財物有關的活動，而不是與自己的財物有關的活動。 K/《義註》補充說，如果所有者已給予拿取該物品的權限，則不滿足此處的對象因素。當然，這個評論必須是有限制的，留意到如果該物品是貴重物品，那麼根據另一條戒條，拿走它就會涉及犯戒。
