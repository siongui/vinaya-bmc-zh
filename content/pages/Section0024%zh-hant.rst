          *Should any bhikkhu pick up or have (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable, except in a monastery or in a dwelling, it is to be confessed. But when a bhikkhu has picked up or had (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable (left) in a monastery or in a dwelling, he is to keep it, (thinking,) “Whoever it belongs to will (come and) fetch it.” This is the proper course here.*

          *如果任何比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起一件貴重物品或被認為是貴重物品，除了在寺院或住所內，波逸提。但是，當比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起寺院或住所中（被遺留下）的貴重物品或被視為貴重物品時，他應收藏它，（思考）「無論它屬於誰，都會（過來）拿它。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The general purpose of this rule is to prevent a bhikkhu from picking up misplaced valuables belonging to other people, for as the origin story shows, there are dangers inherent in such an act even when done with the best intentions.

     - 本戒條的總體目的是防止比丘撿起屬於其他人的遺失的貴重物品，因為正如\ `起源故事 <https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_005#0218a03>`_\ 所示，即使是出於最好的意圖，這種行為也存在固有的危險。

          “Now at that time a certain bhikkhu was bathing in the Aciravatī River. And a certain brahman, having placed a bag of 500 gold pieces on the river bank, bathed in the river and left, forgetting it. The bhikkhu, (saying to himself,) ‘Don’t let this bag of the brahman’s be lost,’ picked it up. Then the brahman, remembering, rushed back and said to the bhikkhu, ‘My good man, have you seen my bag?’

          「爾時，有一位比丘正在阿致羅筏底河沐浴。某一位婆羅門，將一袋五百金幣放在河岸上，沐浴在河中，忘記它而離去。比丘（自言自語）『不要讓這個婆羅門的袋子丟失』，把它撿起來。這時，婆羅門想起來了，衝回來對比丘說：『善男子，你看到我的袋子了嗎？』

          “‘Here you are, brahman,’ he said, and gave it to him.

          「『給你，婆羅門，』他說，把它交給了他。

          “Then the thought occurred to the brahman, ‘Now by what means can I get away without giving a reward to this bhikkhu?’ So (saying,) ‘I didn’t have 500, my good man, I had 1,000!’ he detained him for a while and then let him go.”

          「然後，婆羅門想到，『現在我怎麼能不給這位比丘報酬而逃脫呢？』所以（說）『我沒有 500 ，善男子，我有 1,000 ！』拘留了他一段時間，然後就放了他。」

   * - However, a bhikkhu who comes across a fallen valuable in a monastery or in a dwelling he is visiting—if he does not pick it up—may later be held responsible if it gets lost: thus the two situations mentioned as exemptions in the rule. In situations such as these, a bhikkhu is allowed even to pick up money and other items he is not normally allowed to take. In fact, the Vinaya-mukha states that if he does *not* pick up the valuable and put it in safe-keeping, he incurs a dukkaṭa. None of the other texts mention this point, although it is probably justified on the grounds that the bhikkhu is neglecting his duty in not following the “proper course” here.

     - 然而，比丘在寺院或他所拜訪的住處中發現掉落的貴重物品，如果他沒有撿起來，之後如果丟失的話，可能要承擔責任：因此，戒條中提到的兩種情況是豁免的。在這類情況下，比丘甚至可以拿走金錢和其他他通常不被允許拿走的物品。事實上，《戒律入口》指出，如果他\ *不*\撿起貴重物品並將其妥善保管，他犯《突吉羅》。其他文獻都沒有提到這一點，儘管這可能是合理的，因為比丘在這裡沒有遵循「適當的方針」而忽視了他的職責。
