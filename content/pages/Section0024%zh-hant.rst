          *Should any bhikkhu, unannounced beforehand, cross the threshold of a consecrated noble king’s (sleeping chamber) from which the king has not left, from which the valuable (the queen) has not withdrawn, it is to be confessed.*

          “As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One, ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would appoint a bhikkhu to teach Dhamma in our harem’…. So the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, ‘In that case, Ānanda, go teach Dhamma in the king’s harem.’

          “Responding, ‘As you say, venerable sir,’ Ven. Ānanda entered the king’s harem time and again to teach Dhamma. Then (one day) Ven.

Ānanda coming from afar and, on seeing him, got up hurriedly. Her cloth of burnished gold slipped off. Ven. Ānanda turned around and went back to the monastery.”

   * - The factors for the full offense here are two: object and effort.
     - 構成完全違犯的因素有二：對象和努力。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - A king—a consecrated (“crowned” in Western terms) member of the noble warrior class, pure in his lineage through the past seven generations—is in his sleeping chamber with his queen. *Sleeping chamber* means any place where his bed is prepared, even if it is outside, surrounded only by a curtain or screen wall (as was the custom on royal excursions in those days, a custom often depicted in murals on the walls of Thai temples).

     - 一位國王——一位神聖（用西方術語來說是「加冕」）的貴族武士階層\ :small:`[譯註:剎帝利]`\ 成員，其血統在過去七代中保持純正——正與他的王后在他的寢宮中。\ *寢宮*\ 指的是任何鋪好床的地方，即使是在室外，僅用帷幔或屏風牆圍起來（就像當時皇家出遊時的習俗一樣，這種習俗經常在泰國寺廟牆壁上的壁畫中描繪）。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - If, unannounced, one steps over the threshold of the sleeping chamber with one foot, the penalty is a dukkaṭa; when both feet are over the threshold, a pācittiya. Perception as to whether one has been announced is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).

     - 若未經通知，單腳踏入寢室門檻，懲罰是《突吉羅》；若雙腳踏入門檻，懲罰是《波逸提》。在此，是否已事先通知的感知在此並非減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - There is no offense if—
     - 不構成犯戒，如果——

   * - Obviously, there is little chance that a bhikkhu will break this rule at present. However, in the course of formulating the rule, the Buddha mentioned ten dangers for a bhikkhu who enters the king’s inner palace even at the king’s request, and some of these dangers still apply to any situation in which a bhikkhu is on familiar terms with a person of influence, royal or not:

     - 顯然，目前比丘違反此戒條的可能性很小。然而，佛陀在制定此戒條時，曾提及比丘即使應國王之邀進入國王內宮，也會面臨\ `十種危險 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0215a02>`_\ 。其中一些危險至今仍然適用於比丘與有影響力的人物（無論是否為王室成員）關係密切的任何情況：

   * - .. container:: notification

          *Should any bhikkhu pick up or have (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable, except in a monastery or in a dwelling, it is to be confessed. But when a bhikkhu has picked up or had (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable (left) in a monastery or in a dwelling, he is to keep it, (thinking,) “Whoever it belongs to will (come and) fetch it.” This is the proper course here.*

     - .. container:: notification

          *如果任何比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起一件貴重物品或被認為是貴重物品，除了在寺院或住所內，波逸提。但是，當比丘撿起或令（某人）撿起寺院或住所中（被遺留下）的貴重物品或被視為貴重物品時，他應收藏它，（思考）「無論它屬於誰，都會（過來）拿它。這於此是如法的。*

   * - The general purpose of this rule is to prevent a bhikkhu from picking up misplaced valuables belonging to other people, for as the origin story shows, there are dangers inherent in such an act even when done with the best intentions.

     - 本戒條的總體目的是防止比丘撿起屬於其他人的遺失的貴重物品，因為正如\ `起源故事 <https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0218a03>`_\ 所示，即使是出於最好的意圖，這種行為也存在固有的危險。

          “Now at that time a certain bhikkhu was bathing in the Aciravatī River. And a certain brahman, having placed a bag of 500 gold pieces on the river bank, bathed in the river and left, forgetting it. The bhikkhu, (saying to himself,) ‘Don’t let this bag of the brahman’s be lost,’ picked it up. Then the brahman, remembering, rushed back and said to the bhikkhu, ‘My good man, have you seen my bag?’

     - .. container:: px-4

          「爾時，有一位比丘正在阿致羅筏底河沐浴。某一位婆羅門，將一袋五百金幣放在河岸上，沐浴在河中，忘記它而離去。比丘（自言自語）『不要讓這個婆羅門的袋子丟失』，把它撿起來。這時，婆羅門想起來了，衝回來對比丘說：『善男子，你看到我的袋子了嗎？』

   * - .. container:: px-4

          “‘Here you are, brahman,’ he said, and gave it to him.

     - .. container:: px-4

          「『給你，婆羅門，』他說，把它交給了他。

   * - .. container:: px-4

          “Then the thought occurred to the brahman, ‘Now by what means can I get away without giving a reward to this bhikkhu?’ So (saying,) ‘I didn’t have 500, my good man, I had 1,000!’ he detained him for a while and then let him go.”

     - .. container:: px-4

          「然後，婆羅門想到，『現在我怎麼能不給這位比丘報酬而逃脫呢？』所以（說）『我沒有 500 ，善男子，我有 1,000 ！』拘留了他一段時間，然後就放了他。」

   * - However, a bhikkhu who comes across a fallen valuable in a monastery or in a dwelling he is visiting—if he does not pick it up—may later be held responsible if it gets lost: thus the two situations mentioned as exemptions in the rule. In situations such as these, a bhikkhu is allowed even to pick up money and other items he is not normally allowed to take. In fact, the Vinaya-mukha states that if he does *not* pick up the valuable and put it in safe-keeping, he incurs a dukkaṭa. None of the other texts mention this point, although it is probably justified on the grounds that the bhikkhu is neglecting his duty in not following the “proper course” here.

     - 然而，比丘在寺院或他所拜訪的住處中發現掉落的貴重物品，如果他沒有撿起來，之後如果丟失的話，可能要承擔責任：因此，戒條中提到的兩種情況是豁免的。在這類情況下，比丘甚至可以拿走金錢和其他他通常不被允許拿走的物品。事實上，《戒律入口》指出，如果他\ *不*\撿起貴重物品並將其妥善保管，他犯《突吉羅》。其他文獻都沒有提到這一點，儘管這可能是合理的，因為比丘在這裡沒有遵循「適當的方針」而忽視了他的職責。

   * - The Vibhaṅga advises that if a bhikkhu has picked up a fallen valuable in this way and put it in safe keeping, he should take note of its features. (The Commentary adds that if it is a bag of money, he should open the bag and count how much it contains. The same would hold for such things as wallets at present.) He should then have an announcement made, “Let him come whose goods are lost.” If a person comes to claim the item, the bhikkhu should ask him/her to describe it. If the person describes it correctly, the bhikkhu should hand it over. If not, he should tell the person to “keep looking.” If the bhikkhu is going to leave the monastery to live elsewhere, he should entrust the item to another bhikkhu or—if no suitable bhikkhu is available—to a suitable lay person (§).

     - 《經分別》建議，如果比丘以這種方式撿起掉落的貴重物品並將其妥善保管，他應該記下它的特徵。（《義註》補充說，如果是一袋金錢，他應該打開袋子數一下裡面有多少錢。在目前，錢包之類的東西也應如此做。）然後他應該宣布：「誰的東西丟了請過來。」如果有人來領取物品，比丘應該請他/她描述它。如果此人描述正確，比丘應該交給他。如果不正確，他應該告訴這個人「繼續尋找」。如果比丘要離開寺院到其他地方居住，他應該將物品託付給另一位比丘，或者－－如果沒有合適的比丘－－託付給合適的在家人（§）。

   * - The Commentary adds that if, after a suitable length of time, no one comes to claim the item, the bhikkhu should have it exchanged for something of lasting use to the monastery. If, after that, the owner does come to claim the item, the bhikkhu should tell him/her of the use to which it was put. If the owner is satisfied, there is no problem. If not, the bhikkhu should arrange to have the owner compensated. However, as we noted in the discussion of compensation under `Pr 2`_, the Canon imposes only one potential penalty on a bhikkhu in a situation such as this: The Community, if it sees fit, can force him to apologize to the owner (`Cv.I.20`_; see `BMC2, Chapter 20`_).

     - 《義註》補充說，如果在一段適當的時間後，沒有人來領取該物品，比丘應該將其換成對寺院持久使用的東西。如果之後，所有者真的來領取該物品，比丘應該告訴他/她該物品的用途。如果所有者滿意的話就沒有問題。如果不滿意，比丘應該安排對所有者進行補償。然而，正如我們在討論\ `《波羅夷》二`_\ 下的賠償時所指出的，在這種情況下，《聖典》只對比丘施加一種潛在的處罰：如果僧團認為合適，可以強迫他向所有者道歉（\ `《小品》.一.20`_\；見\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十章`_\）。

   * - The factors for the offense here are four.
     - 這裡的犯戒因素有四個。

   * - *3) Intention:* One wants to keep it in safe keeping for the owner.

   * - *4) Effort:* One picks it up or has someone else pick it up.

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines a *valuable* as jewels, gold, or silver. At present, money would be included here. *What is considered a valuable* means anything that people use or consume. Items meeting these definitions at present would include wallets, watches, keys, eyeglasses, cameras, etc.

     - 《經分別》將\ *有價值的物品*\定義為珠寶、黃金或白銀。目前，金錢也包含在這裡。\ *被認為有價值的東西*\是指人們使用或消費的任何東西。目前符合這些定義的物品包括錢包、手錶、鑰匙、眼鏡、相機等。

   * - According to the K/Commentary, the object has to belong to someone else to fulfill the factor of effort here. The Vibhaṅga does not state this point explicitly, but it does make the point implicitly with the activities it discusses under this rule: putting an item in safe keeping, quizzing those who come to claim it, taking an item on trust, borrowing it. These are all activities that pertain to the belongings of others, and not to one’s own belongings. The K/Commentary adds that if the owner has given one permission to take the article, it does not fulfill the factor of object here. This comment has to be qualified, of course, by noting that if the item is a valuable, then taking it would involve an offense under another rule.

     - 根據 K/《義註》，物品必須屬於其他人才能滿足此處的努力因素。《經分別》沒有明確說明這一點，但它確實透過在本戒條下討論的活動隱含地表達了這一點：妥善保管一件物品，詢問那些前來索取它的人，託付一件物品，借用它。這些都是與他人的財物有關的活動，而不是與自己的財物有關的活動。 K/《義註》補充說，如果所有者已給予拿取該物品的權限，則不滿足此處的對象因素。當然，這個評論必須是有限制的，留意到如果該物品是貴重物品，那麼根據另一條戒條，拿走它就會涉及犯戒。

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines *in a monastery* as follows: If the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If not, then in the immediate vicinity (according to the Commentary, a radius of two *leḍḍupātas*\—approximately 36 meters—around the monastery buildings). As for *in a dwelling*: If the area around the dwelling is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If not, then in the immediate vicinity (according to the Commentary, the distance one can throw a basket or a pestle (!) from the dwelling).
     - 《經分別》對\ *寺院裡*\的定義如下：如果寺院是封閉的，那就在封閉的範圍內。如果不是，那麼就在緊鄰範圍裡（根據《義註》，圍繞寺院建築的半徑為兩個 *leḍḍupāta*\，大約 36 公尺）。至於\ *住處裡*\：如果住處周圍的區域是封閉的，則在封閉範圍內。如果不是，那麼就在緊鄰範圍裡（根據《義註》，可以從住處扔籃子或杵（！）的距離）。

   * - For some reason, the Commentary says that if the item has fallen in an area of the monastery where many people come and go—e.g., the doorway to the Bodhi tree or public shrine—one should not pick it up. Its reasoning here is hard to guess. It notes that the Kurundī—one of the ancient commentaries—interprets the range of a bhikkhu’s responsibility in the opposite direction. In other words, the Kurundī holds that if a bhikkhu walking alone along a road outside a monastery comes across a valuable or anything considered valuable in such circumstances that he might later be suspected of being responsible for its disappearance, he should stop and wait by the roadside until the owner appears. If no owner appears, he should make it “allowable” and take it with him. The Sub-commentary adds that *making it allowable* means deciding that it has been thrown away, and applies only to items classed as “considered a valuable.” All of this, however, lies outside the allowances in the Vibhaṅga, and at most can be adopted, where appropriate, as a wise policy.

     - 由於某種原因，《義註》說，如果該物品落在寺院內人來人往的地方，例如菩提樹的門口或公共聖壇，則不應撿起它。這裡它的推理很難猜測。它指出，《Kurundī》——古代註釋之一——從相反的方向解釋了比丘的責任範圍。換句話說，《Kurundī》認為，如果一個比丘獨自走在寺院外的路上，遇到一個貴重的東西或任何被認為有價值的東西，並且在這種情況下他可能會被懷疑對它的失蹤負有責任，他應該停下來在路邊等待，直到所有者出現。如果所有者沒有出現，他應該讓它成為「允許的」並帶走它。《複註》補充說，\ *讓它成為允許的*\意思是決定它已被丟棄，並且僅適用於被歸類為「被認為有價值」的物品。然而，所有這些都超出了《經分別》的允許範圍，最多可以在適當的情況下作為明智之舉而採用。

   * - The Commentary also notes that if someone asks to put his/her belongings in safe keeping with a bhikkhu, the bhikkhu should not accept—so as to avoid being responsible for them—but if he/she leaves the things with the bhikkhu and goes off in spite of his objections or before giving him a chance to object, he should take the belongings and put them away in safe keeping.

     - 《義註》還指出，如果有人要求將自己的物品交給比丘保管，比丘不應接受——以免對這些物品負責——但如果他/她將物品留給比丘，並且儘管他反對，或者在給他反對的機會之前離開，他應該拿走財物並妥善保管。

   * - **Perception & intention**
     - **感知 及 意圖**

   * - According to the Commentary, if one picks up money for one’s own use, for the Community, or for anyone aside from the owner, the case would come under `NP 18`_, rather than here. The same holds true with dukkaṭa objects, such as jewels and semi-precious stones. This judgment, though, would seem to hold only in the case where one perceives the money, etc., as thrown away or left behind for the use of the person or Community for whom one is taking it. If one does not perceive it as thrown away or abandoned, and one is not borrowing it or taking it on trust, the case would come under `Pr 2`_, regardless of what the item is.

     - 根據《義註》，如果撿取金錢用於自己、僧團或除所有者之外的任何人，則該情況將屬於\ `《捨墮》一八`_\，而不是這裡。對於珠寶和半寶石等《突吉羅》物件也是如此。然而，這項判定似乎僅在以下情況成立：認為金錢等被丟棄，或留下供拿取者或拿取者僧團使用。如果不認為它被丟棄或遺棄，並且沒有借用它或親厚取，則該情況將屬於\ `《波羅夷》二`_\，無論該物品是什麼。

   * - The Commentary also makes the peculiar point that if one sees an item belonging to one’s mother or other close relative left behind on the roadside, one would incur the full penalty under this rule for picking it up to put in safe keeping for the owner, but no offense if one took the item, on trust, for one’s own. Of course, after taking it on trust like this, one could then without penalty give it back to the owner as one liked.

     - 《義註》還提出了一個奇特的觀點，如果看到屬於自己母親或其他近親的物品留在路邊，根據本戒條，拾起該物品並妥善保管將受到全額懲罰，但如果出於親厚而拿取這件物品，則沒有犯戒。當然，這樣親厚取之後，就可以依照自己的喜好，不受懲罰地還給所有者了。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Vibhaṅga says that if the village as a whole is enclosed, everywhere inside the enclosure is considered to be in the village. If not, the area in the village includes all the buildings and their immediate vicinity. According to the Sub-commentary, this means everywhere within a two-\ *leḍḍupāta* radius of the buildings.

     - 《經分別》指出，如果整個村莊被圍起來，那麼圍起來的所有區域都屬於村莊範圍。如果沒有被圍起來，村莊的範圍則包括所有建築物及其周邊區域。根據《複註》，這意味著建築物半徑為兩個 *leḍḍupāta* 內的所有區域都屬於村莊範圍。

   * - Thus if one is staying in a monastery located within a village or town, the area covered by this factor would apparently begin at the vicinity of the nearest buildings outside the monastery.

     - 因此，如果住在位於村莊或城鎮內的寺院裡，那麼這個因素所涵蓋的區域顯然會從寺院外最近的建築物周圍開始。

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The Vibhaṅga defines the *wrong time* as from after noon until the following dawnrise. This rule thus dovetails with `Pc 46`_, which deals with the period from dawnrise until noon on days when one has been invited to a meal.

     - 《經分別》將\ *非時*\ 定義為中午過後至隔天黎明。這條戒條與\ `《波逸提》四六`_\ 相銜接吻合，該條規定了受邀赴餐食日子裡，從黎明到中午這段時間。

   * - Perception as to whether the time is right or wrong is not a mitigating factor here (see `Pc 4`_).
     - 關於是否非時的感知在這裡並不構成減輕懲罰的因素（參見\ `《波逸提》四`_\ ）。

   * - As under `Pc 46`_, another bhikkhu is said to be available for taking one’s leave if, in the Vibhaṅga’s words, “It is possible to go, having taken leave of him.” That is, if there is another bhikkhu in the monastery, and there are no obstacles to taking one’s leave from him (e.g., he is asleep, he is sick, he is receiving important visitors), one is obliged to go out of one’s way to inform him.

     - 如同\ `《波逸提》四六`_\ ，如果，用《經分別》的話來說，「告別他之後，就可以離開了。」，那就是有另一位比丘在可以告假。也就是說，如果寺院裡有另一位比丘，並且向他告假沒有任何障礙（例如，他正在睡覺、生病、接待重要訪客），那麼就必須特意去通知他。

   * - According to the K/Commentary, *taking leave* in the context of this rule means the simple act of informing the other bhikkhu that, “I am going into the village,” or any similar statement. In other words, one is not asking permission to go, although if the other bhikkhu sees that one is doing something improper in going, he is perfectly free to say so. If one treats his comments with disrespect, one incurs at least a dukkaṭa under `Pc 54`_. (See the discussion under that rule for details.)

     - 根據 K/《義註》，在此戒條的脈絡中，「\ *告假*\ 」僅指告知另一位比丘「我要入村」或類似表述。換言之，並非徵求前去的許可，但若另一位比丘認為在前往時會做不恰當的事情，他完全可以指出來。若對他的指正不敬，則至少會根據\ `《波逸提》五四`_\ 犯《突吉羅》（詳情請參閱該戒條下的討論）。

   * - The Commentary states that if there is no bhikkhu in the monastery to take leave from, there is no need to inform any bhikkhu one may meet after leaving the monastery. If many bhikkhus are going together, they need only take leave from one another before entering the village.

     - 《義註》指出，如果寺院裡沒有比丘可以告假，那麼離開寺院後遇到的任何比丘都不需要告知。如果很多比丘一同前往，他們只需在進入村莊前互相告假即可。

   * - For a new bhikkhu still living in dependence *(nissaya)* on his mentor, though, the protocols in Cullavagga VIII indicate that taking leave *is* a matter of asking permission from his mentor at all times, “wrong” or not. (See the discussion of this point under `Pc 46`_.)

     - 然而，對於一位仍依止於其導師\ *（nissaya）*\ 的新比丘而言，\ `《小品》第八卷`_\ 的行儀表明，無論「非」時與否，告假隨時\ *都*\ 要徵得導師的同意。（參見\ `《波逸提》四六`_\ 對此的討論。）

   * - As for the suitable emergencies under this rule—which would seem to exempt even new bhikkhus from having to take leave from their mentors—the Vibhaṅga gives the example of a bhikkhu rushing to get fire to make medicine for another bhikkhu bitten by a snake. Examples more likely at present would include rushing to get a doctor for a sick bhikkhu or to get help when a fire has broken out in the monastery.

     - 至於這條戒條下適用的緊急情況——這似乎意味著即使是新比丘也不必向他們的導師告假——《經分別》舉例說，一位比丘急忙去取火，為另一位被蛇咬傷的比丘熬製藥物。而如今更常見的例子則包括急忙為生病的比丘請醫生，或在寺院發生火災時尋求幫助。

   * - Although there is no penalty for engaging in animal talk, a bhikkhu who enters a village frequently and engages in it, even if he takes leave of other bhikkhus, can be subject to an act of censure for “unbecoming association with householders” (see BMC2, Chapter 20).

     - 雖然從事畜生論並沒有懲罰，但經常進入村莊從事畜生論的比丘，即使向其他比丘告假，也可能因「與居士交往不當」而受到呵責的處分（見\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第二十章`_\ ）。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Now at that time a certain ivory-worker had invited the bhikkhus, saying, ‘If any of the masters needs a needle box, I will supply him with a needle box.’ So the bhikkhus asked for many needle boxes. Those with small needle boxes asked for large ones; those with large ones asked for small ones. (§) The ivory-worker, making many needle boxes for the bhikkhus, was not able to make other goods for sale. He could not support himself, and his wife and children suffered.”

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「其時，一位象牙匠邀請比丘們，說：『如果哪位大德需要針盒，我可以給他提供。』於是比丘們索要許多針盒。有小針盒的就去要大的，有大的就去要小的。（§）這位象牙匠為比丘們製作了許多針盒，卻無力製作其他商品出售。他無法養活自己，妻子和孩子也因此受苦。」

   * - **Effort**
     - **努力**

   * - The permutations under this factor are as follows: the act of making the needle box or having it made—a dukkaṭa; obtaining the finished box—a pācittiya. This last penalty applies regardless of whether the box was made entirely by oneself, entirely by others either partly or entirely at one’s instigation, or whether one finished what others began or got others to finish what one began oneself. In any event, one must break the box before confessing the offense.

     - 此因素下的排列組合如下：製作針盒或讓人製作針盒的行為——《突吉羅》；取得成品盒——《波逸提》。無論針盒是完全由自己製作，還是完全由他人製作（部分或全部受自己唆使），亦或是自己完成了他人開始之物，或令他人完成了自己開始之物，最後一種懲罰均適用。無論如何，必須在懺悔罪行前打碎該盒。

   * - If one obtains a bone, ivory, or horn needle box made by another—not at one’s instigation—then using it entails a dukkaṭa (§).
     - 如果獲得了由他人製作的骨頭、象牙或角針盒——並非是應自己的唆使要求製作的——那麼使用它犯《突吉羅》（§）。

   * - **Intention**
     - **意圖**

   * - There is a dukkaṭa in making a bone, ivory, or horn needle box—or having it made—for another’s use.
     - 為了他人而製作或令人製作骨頭、象牙或角針盒，犯《突吉羅》。

   * - **Non-offenses**
     - **不犯**

   * - The non-offense clauses, instead of listing materials from which a needle box might be made, list allowable items made of bone, ivory, or horn: a fastener (§) (for a robe), a fire-starter (according to the Commentary, this means a bow used with the upper stick of a fire-starter), a belt fastener, an ointment box, a stick for applying ointment, an adze handle, and a water wiper (§) (see `BMC2, Chapter 1`_). This list was apparently intended simply to be illustrative, because the Khandhakas contain allowances for many other items to be made from bone, ivory, or horn as well—although it’s worth noting that the non-offense clauses here are the only passages in the Canon stating that the fire-starter, adze handle, and water wiper can be made of these materials.

     - 不犯條款並未列舉製作針盒的可用材料，而是列出了允許用骨頭、象牙或角製成的物品：扣件（§）（用於袈裟）、引火物（根據《義註》，這指的是與引火物上桿配合使用的弓形物）、腰帶扣、藥膏盒、塗抹藥膏的棍子、斧頭柄和擦水器（§）（參見\ `《佛教比丘戒律 第二冊》第一章`_\ ）。這份清單顯然只是為了舉例說明，因為《犍度》中也允許用骨頭、象牙或角製作許多其他物品——儘管值得注意的是，此處的不犯條款是《聖典》中唯一明確指出引火物、斧頭柄和擦水器可以用這些材料製成的段落。

   * - `Pc 60`_ mentions a needle box as one of a bhikkhu’s requisites, so apparently one would be allowable if not made of bone, ivory, or horn. `Cv.V.11.2`_ contains an allowance for a “needle tube” (or “needle cylinder”—\ *sūci-nāḷika*\ ) for keeping needles, but does not explain how it differs from a needle box. Apparently both the box and the tube may be made of reed, bamboo, wood, lac (resin), fruit (e.g., coconut shell), copper (metal), or conch-shell, as the Khandhakas often list these materials as allowable for other items as well.

     - `《波逸提》六十`_\ 提到針盒是比丘的必備物品之一，因此，如果不是用骨頭、象牙或角製成的，針盒顯然是允許的。\ `《小品》.五.11.2`_\ 允許使用「針筒」（或「針管」－\ *sūci-nāḷika*\ ）來存放針，但並未解釋它與針盒有何不同。顯然，針盒和針筒都可以用蘆葦、竹子、木頭、紫膠（樹脂）、水果（例如椰子殼）、銅（金屬）或海螺殼製成，因為《犍度》也經常將這些材料列為其他物品的允許材料。

     - 《戒律入口》從這條戒條中引申出一條普遍原則：佛陀制定這條戒條，是為了阻止比丘中出現某種風尚，即某些必需品變得時髦，以至於給布施者帶來不便。如今，上座比丘應該嘗試阻止任何類似的風尚。

   * - **Object**
     - **對象**

   * - The Canon contains many rules dealing with furnishings, especially in the Khandhakas, and because furnishings in the time of the Buddha were somewhat different from what they are now, it is often a matter of guesswork as to what, precisely, the rules are referring to. The *bed (mañca)* here almost certainly refers to what we mean by a bed. The *bench (pīṭha)*, according to the K/Commentary, is shorter than a bed, but not so short that it is square. This last stipulation comes from `Cv.VI.2.4`_, which allows bhikkhus to use an *āsandika*\ —apparently a square stool, large enough to sit on but not to lie on—even if the legs are long. Another piece of furniture with long legs allowed in the same passage is the *sattaṅga*, a chair or sofa with a back and arms. The Vinaya-mukha includes a *pañcaṅga*\ —a chair or sofa with a back but no arms—under this allowance as well. The Canon and commentaries make no mention of this point, but it seems valid: Armless chairs and sofas are less imposing than those with arms.

     - 《聖典》中包含許多關於傢俱的戒條，尤其是在《犍度》中。由於佛陀時代的傢俱與現在有所不同，因此這些戒條的具體意義往往需要推測。這裡的\ *床（mañca）*\ 幾乎可以肯定是指我們今天所說的床。根據 K/《義註》，\ *凳子（pīṭha）*\ 比床短，但又不至於短到呈正方形。最後這項規定出自\ `《小品》.六.2.4`_\ ，其中允許比丘使用 *āsandika* ——顯然是方形凳子，這種凳子足夠大，可以坐，但不能躺——即使凳腿很長。在同一段落中允許使用的另一種長腿家具是 *sattaṅga* ，一種有靠背和扶手的椅子或沙發。《戒律入口》中也允許使用 *pañcaṅga* ——一種有靠背但沒有扶手的椅子或沙發。《聖典》和註釋書中都沒有提到這一點，但這似乎是合理的：沒有扶手的椅子和沙發不如有扶手的椅子和沙發那麼引人注目。

   * - The sugata measures are a matter of controversy, discussed in `Appendix II`_. For the purposes of this book, we are taking the sugata span to be 25 cm. Because there are twelve sugata fingerbreadths in a sugata span, eight sugata fingerbreadths would be equal to 16.7 cm.

     - 善逝的度量衡存在爭議，在\ `附錄二`_ 中討論。本書中，我們將善逝張手定為 25 公分。因為一善逝張手有十二善逝指寬，所以八善逝指寬等於 16.7 公分。

There are three exceptions to this allowance, the one piece objected to on account of its height being a dais *(āsandī)*\—a square platform, large enough to lie on, and very high. Bhikkhus are not allowed even to sit on such a thing, even in a lay person’s house.

          *如果任何比丘的床或凳子是用棉絨填充的，它（填充物）應該被撕掉並懺悔[波逸提]。*

   * - **Upholstery & cushions**
     - **坐椅填充物及墊子**

   * - Cotton down was apparently the most luxurious material known in the Buddha’s time for stuffing furniture, cushions, and mattresses, inasmuch as bhikkhus are forbidden by this rule from making beds and benches upholstered with cotton-down. `Cv.VI.8`_ forbids them from sitting on cushions or other articles of furnishing upholstered or stuffed with cotton down (this would include meditation cushions), even in the homes of lay people. The only article of furnishing stuffed with cotton down allowed to bhikkhus is a pillow (§), although the pillow should be made no larger than the size of the head (`Cv.VI.2.6`_).

     - 在佛陀時代，棉絨顯然是已知最奢華的材料，用來填充家具、坐墊和床墊，因此，此戒條禁止比丘製作以棉絨為填充物的床和凳子。\ `《小品》.六.8`_ 禁止比丘坐在以棉絨為填充物的墊子或其他家具物上（包括禪坐墊子），即使在居士的家中也不例外。比丘唯一被允許的以棉絨為填充物的家具是枕頭（§），但枕頭不得超過頭部的大小（\ `《小品》.六.2.6`_\ ）。

   * - The Commentary’s explanations of this point show that the pillow used in those days was an oblong cushion, looking like a rectangle when viewed from above and a triangle when viewed from either the right or left side (like the old style of pillow still in use in Thailand). Such pillows, the Commentary says, should be no more than two cubits (1 meter) long, and one span plus four fingerbreadths (32 cm.) from corner to corner on the sides (although this seems considerably larger than a pillow “the size of the head”). A bhikkhu who is not ill may use such a pillow for his head and feet; an ill bhikkhu may line up a series of pillows, cover them with a cloth, and lie down on them with no offense. According to `Cv.VI.14`_, if bhikkhus are presented with cushions stuffed with cotton down, they may use them only after tearing them up and making them into pillows.

     - 《義註》對此的解釋表明，當時使用的枕頭是一種長橢圓形的墊子，從上方看呈長方形，從左側或右側看呈三角形（類似於泰國至今仍在使用的舊式枕頭）。《義註》說，這種枕頭的長度不應超過兩肘（1公尺），從邊角到另一邊角不超過一張手加四指寬（32公分）（儘管這似乎比「頭部大小」的枕頭要大得多）。無病的比丘可以用這種枕頭墊頭和腳；生病的比丘可以擺放一排枕頭，用布蓋好，然後躺下，並不犯戒。根據\ `《小品》.六.14`_\ ，如果比丘獲贈填充棉絨的墊子，他們只能將其撕碎，重新製成枕頭後才能使用。

   * - Human hair was another forbidden form of stuffing. Mattresses and cushions stuffed with other materials, though, are allowed even for use in the monastery. `Cv.VI.2.7`_ mentions five kinds of allowable stuffing: wool, cloth, bark, grass, and leaves. (According to the Commentary, *wool* here includes all kinds of animal fur and bird feathers. Goose down would thus be allowable. Synthetic fibers and synthetic down would apparently come under “cloth.” The Commentary also mentions that, according to the Kurundī, mattresses and cushions stuffed with these materials are allowable whether covered with leather or cloth.)

     - 人類頭髮是另一種被禁止的填充物。不過，即使在寺院內也允許使用填充有其他材料的床墊和墊子。\ `《小品》.六.2.7`_ 提到了五種允許的填充物：羊毛、布、樹皮、草和樹葉。（根據《義註》，這裡的\ *羊毛*\ 包括各種動物毛皮和鳥類羽毛。因此，鵝絨是允許的。合成纖維和合成絨顯然屬於「布」。《義註》還提到，根據《Kurundī》，用這些材料填充的床墊和墊子是允許的，無論覆蓋著皮革還是布料。）

   * - The purpose of all this is to keep bhikkhus from using furnishings that are extravagant and ostentatious. As the Vinaya-mukha mentions, though, standards of what counts as extravagant and ostentatious vary from age to age and culture to culture. Some of the things allowed in the Canon and commentaries now seem exotic and luxurious; and other things forbidden by them, common and ordinary. Thus the wise policy, in a monastery, would be to use only those furnishings allowed by the rules and regarded as unostentatious at present; and, when visiting a lay person’s home, to avoid sitting on furnishings that seem unusually grand.

     - 這一切的目的是為了防止比丘使用奢侈、炫耀的家具。然而，正如《戒律入口》中提到的那樣，奢侈和炫耀的標準因時代和文化的不同而有所不同。《聖典》和註釋書中所允許的一些事物現在看來顯得異國情調和奢華；以及其所禁止的其他事物，現在看來顯得常見和普通。因此，在寺院裡，明智之舉是只使用那些戒條允許的、目前被認為不炫耀的家具。當拜訪居士家中時，避免坐在看起來異常華麗的家具上。

   * - The factors for the offense here are three.

   * - *Cotton down*, according to the Vibhaṅga, includes any down from trees, vines, and grass. The Commentary to `Cv.VI.2.6`_ interprets this as meaning down from *any* plant, inasmuch as “trees, vines, and grass” is the Canon’s usual way of covering all plant life. Kapok, flax fibers, jute, and cotton would thus all come under this category.

     - *棉絨*\ ，根據《經分別》，包括樹木、藤蔓和草類的任何絨毛。\ `《小品》.六.2.6`_\ 的《義註》將其解釋為\ *任何*\ 植物的絨毛，因為「樹木、藤蔓和草類」是《聖典》通常用來指稱所有植物的方式。因此，木棉、亞麻纖維、黃麻和棉花都屬於此種類。

   * - Because cotton-down cushions are forbidden in all situations, *bed and bench* here would seem to include all forms of furniture, including the stools, chairs, and sofas exempted from the preceding rule.

Some group-of-six bhikkhus… used sitting cloths, without any limit in size, that hung down in front and behind even on beds and benches.” (As a result, the Buddha set the limit at 2 by 1.5 spans.) Now, Ven. Udāyin was very large. Setting out his sitting cloth in front of the Blessed One, he stretched it out on all sides before sitting down. The Blessed One said to him, ‘Why is it, Udāyin, that when setting out your sitting cloth you stretch it out on all sides like a worker in old leather? (§)’

          「其時世尊允許比丘們使用坐具。某六群比丘……使用坐具，沒有任何尺寸限制，甚至在床和凳子上都前後垂下。」（因此，佛陀將限制設為 2 x 1.5 張手。）其時，優陀夷尊者身體非常大。在世尊面前鋪其坐具，向四面八方展開，然後坐下。世尊對他說：『優陀夷，為什麼在鋪你的坐具時，你像一個穿著舊皮革的工人一樣將它向四面八方展開呢？(§)』

   * - A sitting cloth, by definition, has to have a border, regardless of whether it is made of felted or woven material. However—as none of the texts give any clear indication as to how many sides should have a border or how the borders should be patterned—there is no definitive measurement as to how large the overall cloth should be. A wise policy, then, is to take the origin story as a guide: Make the cloth large enough so that one can sit cross-legged on it without soiling one’s robes or furnishings, but not so large that it extends out on any side.

     - 坐具，根據定義，必須有邊框，無論其材質是氈製還是編織。然而，由於沒有任何文獻明確指出坐具多少邊應該有邊框，或者邊框的圖案應該如何設計，因此坐具的整體尺寸並沒有確切的標準。所以，明智之舉是以起源故事為指導：製作坐具要足夠大，以便可以雙盤腿而坐而不會弄髒袈裟或家具，但又不能太大，以至於向四面八方延伸。

In any event, one must cut the cloth down to the proper size before confessing the offense.

     - 此因素下的排列組合如下：製作或讓人製作坐具的行為——《突吉羅》；獲得成品——《波逸提》。無論坐具是完全由自己製作，或是完全由他人製作（部分或全部受自己唆使），亦或是完成他人開始之物，或令他人完成自己開始之物，均適用此最後一種懲罰。無論如何，在懺悔罪行之前，必須將坐具裁剪至合適尺寸。

The non-offense clauses also state that there is no offense in a canopy, a floor-covering, a wall screen, a mattress/cushion, or a kneeling mat. This apparently means that if one receives an overly large sitting cloth, one may use it as a canopy, etc., instead.

     - 若收到他人製作的過大坐具（§），且並非應自己的要求，並在使用前將其裁剪至合適尺寸，則不構成犯戒。不犯條款也規定，天篷、地墊、屏風、床墊/墊子或跪墊也不構成犯戒。這顯然意味著，如果收到過大的坐具，可以將其用作天篷等其他用途。

     - **對象**

   * - `Mv.VIII.17`_ allows bhikkhus to use a skin-eruption covering cloth to protect their robes when they are suffering from boils, running sores, rashes, or “thick scab” diseases (large boils? psoriasis?). The Vibhaṅga to this rule states that the cloth is to cover the area from the navel down to the knees, thus suggesting that the cloth is intended to be worn as an inner robe beneath the lower robe. As we already mentioned under `NP 1`_, one should determine these cloths for use when one is suffering from such a disease and place them under shared ownership when not.

     - `《大品》.八.17`_ 允許比丘在患癤、潰爛、皮疹或「厚痂」疾病（大癤？牛皮癬？）時，使用覆瘡布來保護袈裟。此戒條的《經分別》指出，布料應覆蓋從肚臍到膝蓋的區域，這表明布料應作為內衣穿在下衣之內。正如我們在\ `《捨墮》一`_\ 中所述，應在患此種病時決意這些布料使用，並在非患病時將其置於共享所有權之下。

   * - As mentioned under `Pc 87`_, above, the sugata measures are discussed in `Appendix II`_. Here we take the sugata span to equal 25 cm., which would put the standard measurement for the skin-eruption covering cloth at 1 meter by 50 cm.

     - 如上文\ `《波逸提》八七`_\ 所提到，善逝尺寸在\ `附錄二`_\ 中討論。這裡我們取善逝張手為 25 公分，這將使覆瘡布的標準尺寸為 1 公尺 x 50 公分。
