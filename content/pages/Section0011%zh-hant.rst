   * - This term means “involving the Community in the initial *(ādi)* and subsequent *(sesa)* acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of *mānatta*, penance, and *parivāsa*, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.

     - 這個術語的意思是「讓僧團參與初始 *(ādi)* 和後續 *(sesa)* 行為」。它源於這樣一個事實，即僧團是最初要求違反此類戒條的比丘接受懲罰（ *mānatta* ，贖罪(摩那埵)，和 *parivāsa* ，別住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他沒有正確執行，則隨後重新施加懲罰，最終當他正確執行後解除懲罰。此處有十三個學處（訓練戒條），前九個在違反時即犯《僧殘》，最後四個只有在違反者作為僧伽羯磨的一部分被訶責三次之後才犯《僧殘》。

          *故意排出精液（除非在做夢時），僧殘。*

   * - The origin story to this rule is as follows:
     - 本戒條的起源故事如下：

   * - “Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’

     - 「\ `爾時，施越尊者過著不滿的梵行生活`_\ 。是故，他形體枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脈悉現。優陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。一見到他，就對他說：『友！施越！，你為什麼形體枯瘦…筋脈悉現？難道你對梵行生活不滿意？』

   * - “‘Yes, friend.’
     - 「『是的，朋友。』

   * - “‘In that case, eat as you like and sleep as you like and bathe as you like; and having eaten, slept, and bathed as you like, when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails the mind, emit semen having attacked (!) with your hand.’

     - 「『既然如此，想吃就吃，想睡就睡，想沐浴就沐浴；隨心所欲地飲食、睡眠、沐浴，當不滿生起、欲念侵襲心時，就用手攻擊（！）射出精液。』

   * - “‘But is it okay to do that?’
     - 「『但是這樣做可以嗎？』

   * - “‘Of course. I do it myself.’
     - 「『當然。我自己也這樣做。』

   * - “So then Ven. Seyyasaka ate as he liked and slept as he liked… and when dissatisfaction arose and lust assailed his mind, he would emit semen having attacked with his hand. Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’

     - 「於是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，他就會用手攻擊射出精液。然後沒多久，他就變得很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。因此，他的朋友比丘們對他說：『以前，朋友施越，你形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。但現在的你很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。難道是你在吃藥？』

   * - “‘No, I’m not taking medicine, my friends. I just eat as I like and sleep as I like… and when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails my mind, I emit semen having attacked with my hand.’

     - 「『不，我沒吃藥，朋友們。我只是隨心所欲地吃飯，隨心所欲地睡覺……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，我用手攻擊射出精液。』

   * - “‘But do you emit semen having attacked with the same hand you use to eat the gifts of the faithful?’
     - 「『但是，你以此手食信施，又以此手攻擊射出精液？』

   * - “‘Yes, my friends.’”
     - 「『是的，我的朋友們。』」
