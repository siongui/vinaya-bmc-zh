   * - Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.

     - Dhamma-Vinaya（法與律）是佛陀對他所創立的宗教的自己的名字。法——真理——是他發現並指出的，作為對所有想要從痛苦中解脫的人的建議。律（Vinaya）是他為追隨者制定的規則、理想和行為標準。這些追隨者離開家庭生活，更加認真地尋求解脫。雖然本書主要討論戒律，但我們首先應該注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法與律的共同作用。從理論上講，它們可能是分開的，但對於實踐它們的人來說，它們作為心靈和性格中發展的品質而融合在一起。

          “Gotamī, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead to dispassion, not to passion; to being unfettered and not to being fettered; to shedding and not to accumulating; to modesty and not to self-aggrandizement; to contentment and not to discontent; to seclusion and not to entanglement; to aroused energy and not to laziness; to being unburdensome and not to being burdensome’: You may definitely hold, ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”—Cv.X.5

          瞿曇彌！若汝所知之法，此法資長離貪而不資長貪欲、資長離繫而不資長繫縛、資長損減而不資長積集、資長少欲而不資長多欲、資長滿足而不資長不滿足、資長閑寂而不資長聚會、資長精勤而不資長懈怠、資長易養而不資長難養者，瞿曇彌！應知此是法、是律、是師教。」

   * - Ultimately, the Buddha said, just as the sea has a single taste, that of salt, so too the Dhamma and Vinaya have a single taste: that of release. The connection between discipline and release is spelled out in a passage that recurs at several points in the Canon:

     - 佛陀說，最終，正如大海只有一種味道，即鹽的味道一樣，法和律也只有一種味道：解脫的味道。戒律和解脫之間的聯繫在《聖典》中多次重複出現的一段話中得到了闡明：

          “Discipline is for the sake of restraint, restraint for the sake of freedom from remorse, freedom from remorse for the sake of joy, joy for the sake of rapture, rapture for the sake of tranquility, tranquility for the sake of pleasure, pleasure for the sake of concentration, concentration for the sake of knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be, knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be for the sake of disenchantment, disenchantment for the sake of dispassion, dispassion for the sake of release, release for the sake of knowledge and vision of release, knowledge and vision of release for the sake of total unbinding through non-clinging.”—Pv.XII.2

          「戒律是為了克制，克制是為了無悔，無悔是為了歡悅，歡悅是為了喜，喜是為了輕安，輕安是為了樂，樂是為了定，定是為了如實知見，如實知見是為了厭離，厭離是為了離欲，離欲是為了解脫，解脫是為了解脫知見，解脫知見是為了無取著般涅槃。」——《附隨》.十二.2

          此可追溯《中阿含經》卷10〈習相應品〉第五，有16部經都有如下類似的說明：「阿難！因持戒便得不悔。因不悔便得歡悅。 因歡悅便得喜。因喜便得止。因止便得樂。因樂便得定。阿難！多聞聖弟子因定，便得見如實、知如真。因見如實、知如真，便得厭。因厭便得無欲。因無欲便得解脫。因解脫便知解脫︰生已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦，不更受有，知如真。阿難﹗是為法法相益，法法相因。如是此戒趣至第一，謂度此岸，得至彼岸」。
          此次第可以簡化如下︰持戒→無悔→歡悅→心喜→身安（輕安）→樂→心定→如實知見→厭→離欲→解脫→知解脫（自謂︰我證解脫。復起如是智見︰我生已盡、梵行已立、所作已辦，不受後有）。

          律是為律儀，律儀是為無悔恨，無悔恨是為愉悅，愉悅是為喜，喜是為輕安，輕安是為樂，樂是為等持，等持是為如實知見，如實知見是為厭離，厭離是為離欲，離欲是為解脫，解脫是為解脫知見，解脫知見是為無取著般涅槃。為此有〔律之〕論，為此有〔律之〕考量，為此有近習，為此有傾聽，即：此無執取，心解脫。

   * - In establishing his religion of release, though, the Buddha did not simply set out a body of recommendations and rules. He also founded a company (*parisā*) of followers. This company falls into four main groups: bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunīs (nuns), lay men, and lay women. Although the Buddha saw no need to organize the laity in any manner, he arranged for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs—who had given up the entanglements of the household life to devote themselves more fully to the goal of release—to develop into communities. And he saw that they needed, as all communities do, ideals and standards, rules and customs to ensure their stability. This need is what gave rise to the Vinaya.

     - 然而，在建立他的解脫宗教時，佛陀並沒有僅只提出一系列建議和規則。他還創立了追隨眾（ *parisā* ）。該眾分為四個主要群體：比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞（男在家）和優婆夷（女在家）。雖然佛陀認為沒有必要以任何方式組織在家眾，但他安排比丘和比丘尼——他們已經放棄了家庭生活的糾纏，更充分地致力於解脫的目標——發展成團體。他認為，正如所有團體一樣，他們需要理想和標準、規則和習俗來確保穩定。這種需要就是戒律的產生。

   * - In the early years of the Buddha’s career, the texts tell us, there was no need to formulate monastic disciplinary rules. All of the bhikkhus in his following—the Community of bhikkhunīs had not yet been started—were men of high personal attainments who had succeeded in subduing many or all of their mental defilements. They knew his teachings well and behaved accordingly. The Canon tells of how Ven. Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, asked the Buddha at an early date to formulate a Pāṭimokkha, or code of rules, to ensure that the celibate life the Buddha had founded would last long, just as a thread holding together a floral arrangement ensures that the flowers are not scattered by the wind. The Buddha replied that the time for such a code had not yet come, for even the most backward of the men in the Community at that time had already had their first glimpse of the goal. Only when mental effluents (*āsava*) made themselves felt in the Community would there be a need for a Pāṭimokkha.

     - 文獻告訴我們，在佛陀生涯的早期，沒有必要制戒。他追隨者中的所有比丘——比丘尼僧團尚未成立——都是具有很高個人成就的人，他們已經成功地降伏了許多或全部的心理煩惱。他們非常了解他的教導，並按照他的教導行事。《聖典》講述了舍利弗尊者是佛陀的上首弟子之一，他很早就請求佛陀制定《波羅提木叉》戒律，以確保佛陀所創立的梵行生活能夠久住，就像用一根線將插花連接在一起一樣，花不會被風吹散。佛陀回答說，制戒的時候還沒有到來，因為即使是當時僧團中最落後的人也已經得法眼淨。只有當有漏（ *āsava* ）在僧團中出現時，才會需要《波羅提木叉》。

   * - As time passed, the conditions that provided an opening for the effluents within the Community eventually began to appear. The Bhaddāli Sutta (MN 65) presents the Buddha at a later point in his career listing these conditions as five:

     - 隨著時間的推移，僧團內有漏的因緣最終開始出現。 `《跋陀利經》 <{filename}reference/external-link%zh-hant.rst#mn65>`_ （《中部》65經）佛陀在生涯的後期將這些因緣列出為五個：

   * - .. container:: notification

          Ven. Bhaddāli: “Why is it, venerable sir, that there used to be fewer training rules and more bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening? And why is it that there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening?” [Bhaddāli, who has been unwilling to abide by the training rules, seems to be suggesting that the rise in the number of training rules is itself the cause for fewer bhikkhus’ attaining Awakening. The Buddha, however, offers a different explanation.]

          The Buddha: “So it is, Bhaddāli. When beings have begun to degenerate and the true Dhamma has begun to disappear, there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening. The Teacher does not lay down a training rule for his disciples as long as there are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community. But when there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community, then the Teacher lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.

          “There are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community as long as the Community has not become large. But when the Community has become large, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.... When the Community possesses great material gains... great status... a large body of learning… When the Community is long-standing, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.”

          〔跋陀利曰：〕「師尊！依何因、何緣，昔日學處較少而悟入住立之比丘較多耶？又，師尊！依何因、何緣，今日學處較多而悟入住立之比丘〔反〕較少耶？」[跋陀利一直不願意遵守戒律，他似乎在暗示戒律數量的增加本身就是導致證悟的比丘減少的原因。然而，佛陀提供了不同的解釋。]

          〔世尊曰：〕「跋陀利！其實如次：即於諸有情衰落、正法滅沒時，學處較多而悟入住立之比丘較少。跋陀利！在此少許漏住法不現於僧團之期間內，師對諸弟子不予制定學處。跋陀利！若有少許漏住法出現僧團中時，此時師為防衛彼等諸漏住法，而為諸弟子制定學處。

          跋陀利！僧眾不達廣大期間，在此，無少許漏住法出現於僧團中。然而，跋陀利！僧眾達廣大期間時，在此，少許漏住法出現於僧團中。此時，師為防護彼等漏住法，對諸弟子制定學處也。跋陀利！僧團不達〔追求〕最勝利養……乃至……〔不〕達最勝名聞……〔不〕達〔世俗〕多聞……〔不〕達經驗豐富期間（十臘），在此無少許漏住法顯現於僧團中。然而，跋陀利！僧團到達經驗豐富時，在此，少許漏住法出現於僧團中。此時，師為防衛彼等漏住法，對諸弟子制定學處也。

   * - Thus the rules themselves were not the cause for degeneracy in the Community, and the conditions that provided a foothold for the effluents were not themselves effluents. Rather, the growing complexity of the Community provided the opportunity for bhikkhus to act on the basis of their defilements in a growing variety of ways, and the rules—although they could not prevent any of the five conditions—had to become correspondingly complex to counteract the opportunities those conditions provided for unenlightened behavior.

     - 因此，戒律本身並不是僧團墮落的原因，為有漏提供立足點的因緣本身也不是有漏。相反，僧團的日益複雜性為比丘們提供了機會，以越來越多的方式根據他們的煩惱採取行動，而戒律——儘管它們不能阻止五種因緣中的任何一種——必須變得相對應地複雜以抵銷這些因緣為無明的行為提供的機會。

   * - Even when these conditions did arise, though, the Buddha did not set out a full code at once. Instead, he formulated rules one at a time in response to events. The considerations that went into formulating each rule are best illustrated by the events surrounding the formulation of the first.

     - 然而，即使這些因緣確實出現，佛陀也沒有立即制定完整的戒律。相反，他針對事件一次一個地制戒。制定每個戒條時所考慮的因素可以透過圍繞第一個戒條制定時的事件得到最好的說明。
