   * - Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.

     - Dhamma-Vinaya（法與律）是佛陀對他所創立的宗教的自己的名字。法——真理——是他發現並指出的，作為對所有想要從痛苦中解脫的人的建議。律（Vinaya）是他為追隨者制定的規則、理想和行為標準。這些追隨者離開家庭生活，更加認真地尋求解脫。雖然本書主要討論戒律，但我們首先應該注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法與律的共同作用。從理論上講，它們可能是分開的，但對於實踐它們的人來說，它們作為心靈和性格中發展的品質而融合在一起。
