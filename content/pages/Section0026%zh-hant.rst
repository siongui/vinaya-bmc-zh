   * - **CHAPTER TEN**
     - **第十章**

   * - *Sekhiya*
     - *應學*

   * - This term means “to be trained in.” There are 75 training rules in this category, divided by subject into four groups: etiquette in dressing and behaving when in inhabited areas; etiquette in accepting and eating almsfood; etiquette when teaching the Dhamma; and etiquette in urinating, defecating, and spitting.

     - 這個術語的意思是「應當學」。此類別共有75條學處，依主題分為四類：在俗家間的穿著和行為的禮儀；接受和食用缽食的禮儀；講授佛法的禮儀；以及小便、大便和吐痰的禮儀。

   * - *The rules themselves do not impose a direct penalty. Instead, they simply say, “(This is) a training to be observed.” The Vibhaṅga, though, says that to violate any of these rules out of disrespect incurs a dukkaṭa. The non-offense clauses state in each case that to violate them unintentionally, unthinkingly, or unknowingly, or to disobey them when there are dangers or (in most cases) when one is ill, incurs no penalty. (The exemption for dangers is not in the Burmese edition of the Canon.)*

     - *這些戒條本身並沒有直接規定懲罰，只是僅僅說：「（這是）應當學。」然而，《經分別》指出，出於不敬而違反任何這些戒條都會犯《突吉羅》。每條戒條的不犯條款都明確規定，無意、不經思考或不知情地違反戒條，或在危險情況下或（大多數情況下）生病時違反戒條，都不會受到懲罰。（緬甸版的《聖典》中沒有關於危險情況的豁免條款。）*

   * - *The Commentary adds that* unknowingly *in this case does not mean not knowing the rule. For a new bhikkhu not to make the effort to know the rules, it says, would qualify as disrespect. So* unknowingly *here means not knowing that a situation contrary to the rules has developed. For instance, if one does not know that one’s robes have gotten out of kilter, that would not count as a breach of the relevant rule.*

     - *《義註》補充道，此處的「*\ 不知情地\ *」並非指不知道戒條。它指出，對於一位新比丘而言，若不努力去知道戒條，則構成不敬。因此，此處的「*\ 不知情地\ *」指的是不知到已出現違反戒條的情況。例如，若不知曉自己的袈裟歪斜，則不算違反相關戒條。*
