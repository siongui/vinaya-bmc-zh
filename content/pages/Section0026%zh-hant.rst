   * - **CHAPTER TEN**
     - **第十章**

   * - *Sekhiya*
     - *應學*

   * - This term means “to be trained in.” There are 75 training rules in this category, divided by subject into four groups: etiquette in dressing and behaving when in inhabited areas; etiquette in accepting and eating almsfood; etiquette when teaching the Dhamma; and etiquette in urinating, defecating, and spitting.

     - 這個術語的意思是「應當學」。此類別共有75條學處，依主題分為四類：在俗家間的穿著和行為的禮儀；接受和食用缽食的禮儀；講授佛法的禮儀；以及小便、大便和吐痰的禮儀。

   * - *The rules themselves do not impose a direct penalty. Instead, they simply say, “(This is) a training to be observed.” The Vibhaṅga, though, says that to violate any of these rules out of disrespect incurs a dukkaṭa. The non-offense clauses state in each case that to violate them unintentionally, unthinkingly, or unknowingly, or to disobey them when there are dangers or (in most cases) when one is ill, incurs no penalty. (The exemption for dangers is not in the Burmese edition of the Canon.)*

     - *這些戒條本身並沒有直接規定懲罰，只是僅僅說：「（這是）應當學。」然而，《經分別》指出，出於不敬而違反任何這些戒條都會犯《突吉羅》。每條戒條的不犯條款都明確規定，無意、不經思考或不知情地違反戒條，或在危險情況下或（大多數情況下）生病時違反戒條，都不會受到懲罰。（緬甸版的《聖典》中沒有關於危險情況的豁免條款。）*

   * - *The Commentary adds that* unknowingly *in this case does not mean not knowing the rule. For a new bhikkhu not to make the effort to know the rules, it says, would qualify as disrespect. So* unknowingly *here means not knowing that a situation contrary to the rules has developed. For instance, if one does not know that one’s robes have gotten out of kilter, that would not count as a breach of the relevant rule.*

     - *《義註》補充道，此處的「*\ 不知情地\ *」並非指不知道戒條。它指出，對於一位新比丘而言，若不努力去知道戒條，則構成不敬。因此，此處的「*\ 不知情地\ *」指的是不知到已出現違反戒條的情況。例如，若不知曉自己的袈裟歪斜，則不算違反相關戒條。*

   * - **One: The 26 Dealing with Proper Behavior**
     - **第一 二十六條關於適當行為**

   * - The Canon contains several stories in which a bhikkhu’s behavior causes another person to become interested in the Dhamma. The most famous example is the story of Ven. Sāriputta’s first encounter with Ven. Assaji.

     - 《聖典》中記載了幾個比丘的行為如何使他人對佛法產生興趣的故事。其中最著名的例子是舍利弗尊者與\ `阿說示尊者`_\ 初次相遇的故事。

          “Now at that time the wanderer Sañjaya was staying in Rājagaha with a large company of wanderers—250 in all. And at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna were practicing the celibate life under Sañjaya. They had made this agreement: Whoever attains the Deathless first will inform the other.

          「當時，遊方者刪若與一大群遊方者——共250人——住在王舍城。當時，舍利弗和目犍連隨刪若修習梵行。他們約定：誰先證得不死，就通知對方。

   * - .. container:: mx-2

          “Then Ven. Assaji, dressing early in the morning, taking his bowl and (outer) robe, entered Rājagaha for alms: gracious in the way he approached and departed, looked forward and behind, drew in and stretched out (his arm); his eyes downcast, his every movement consummate. Sāriputta the wanderer saw Ven. Assaji going for alms in Rājagaha: gracious… his eyes downcast, his every movement consummate. On seeing him, the thought occurred to him: ‘Surely, of those bhikkhus in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship, this is one. What if I were to go to him and question him: “Friend, on whose account have you gone forth? Or who is your teacher? Or in whose Dhamma do you delight?”’

          「時，阿說示尊者在清晨穿戴整齊，帶著缽和（外）衣，進入王舍城托缽乞食：他進入離開，前瞻後顧，（手臂）伸展都行止優雅；目光低垂，一舉一動都堪稱完美。遊方者舍利弗見阿說示尊者在王舍城托缽乞食，優雅……目光低垂，一舉一動都堪稱完美。見到他，他心中想道：『這世間是阿羅漢、阿羅道具足的比丘中，此人即其中一人。若我上前問他：「朋友，你依誰而出家？你的老師是誰？你好樂誰的法？」會如何』

          “But then the thought occurred to Sāriputta the wanderer: ‘This is the wrong time to question him. Having entered among houses, he is going for alms. What if I were to follow behind this bhikkhu, (to know) the path found out by those who seek it?’”—`Mv.I.23.1-3`_

     - .. container:: mx-2

          「但遊方者舍利弗心中想：『現在不是問他的時候。他已進入民家，正要去托缽乞食。如果我跟隨這位比丘，（了解）那些尋求者所找到之道，會如何呢？』」——\ `《大品》.一.23.1-3`_

   * - Even though the following rules deal with minor matters, a bhikkhu should remind himself that the minor details of his behavior can often make the difference between sparking and killing another person’s interest in the Dhamma.

     - 即使以下戒條涉及的是小事，比丘也應該提醒自己，他行為中的一些小細節往往能決定是激發還是扼殺他人對佛法的興趣。
