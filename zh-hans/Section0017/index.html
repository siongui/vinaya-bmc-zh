The devatā thought: ‘What if I were to kill this bhikkhu right here?’ Then another thought occurred to her: ‘But no, that wouldn’t be proper….

<tr><td>The Pali term for living plant—<em>bhūtagāma</em>—literally means the home of a being. This the Sub-commentary explains by saying that devatās may take up residence in plants standing in place by means of a longing on which their consciousness fastens (at the end of their previous lives) as in a dream. This rule is justified, it says, in that the etiquette of a contemplative precludes doing harm to the abodes of living beings. As the origin story shows, though, the reason this rule was laid down in the first place was to prevent bhikkhus from offending people who held to the animist belief that regarded plants as one-facultied life having the sense of touch.</td>
<td>巴利语中表示活体植物的字——bhūtagāma——字面意思是生物的家。《复注》对此作出了解释，说天神可以透过渴望而居住在站立的植物中，他们的意识（在前世结束时）依附于此，就像在梦中一样。它说，本戒条是合理的，因为沙门的威仪禁止伤害生物的居所。然而，正如起源故事所示，制定这条戒条的初衷是为了防止比丘冒犯那些持有万物有灵论信仰的人，他们认为植物是具有触觉的单能生命。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, a whole plant or part of one that has been removed from its original place is no longer classed as bhūtagāma. If it is capable of growing again when placed in the ground, it is classed as <em>bījagāma</em>, which means “home of a seed.” When a seed is sown, it is regarded as bījagāma until the first shoot turns a fresh green color and the first leaf appears. After that it is regarded as bhūtagāma.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，从原处移走的整株植物或植物的一部分不再被归类为 bhūtagāma。如果它被放入土中后能够再次生长，它就被归类为 <em>bījagāma</em>，意思是「种子的家」。当一颗种子被播下时，它被视为 bījagāma，直到第一根嫩芽变成新鲜的绿色并且长出第一片叶子。此后，它被视为 bhūtagāma。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In line with this criterion, the Commentary classifies as bījagāma such lower forms of plant life as mushrooms that still have their spores, fungi, lichens without leaves, and molds, in that they do not pass through a fresh green stage, have no discernable leaves, and yet are capable of regeneration. Mushrooms that have lost their spores, and parts of any plants that have been removed from place and will not grow, or that have been cooked or otherwise damaged to the point where they are incapable of generation, are not grounds for an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>根据这个标准，《义注》将一些较低级的植物生命形式归类为 bījagāma，如仍有孢子的蘑菇、真菌、无叶地衣和霉菌，因为它们不会经历新鲜的绿色阶段，没有可辨别的叶子，但具有再生能力。已经失去孢子的蘑菇，以及任何被移走而无法生长的植物的部分，或者已经被煮熟或以其他方式损坏到无法繁殖的程度的植物的部分，都不属于根据本戒条犯戒的理由。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary asserts further that to damage bījagāma entails a dukkaṭa. The Vibhaṅga does not mention this point, but the Commentary cites as its justification a passage occurring in a number of suttas (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN02.html">DN 2</a>) saying that a bhikkhu consummate in virtue refrains from harming both bhūtagāma and bījagāma. In doing so, the Commentary is utilizing the Cullavagga’s blanket rule assigning a dukkaṭa to all bad habits (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Cv.V.36">Cv.V.36</a>). The Mahāvagga and Cullavagga give further but partial justification to the Commentary’s assertion in two passages, dealing with bhikkhus eating fruit, which we will discuss below. The Jain ascetics follow similar observances, which suggests that both the Buddhists and the Jains adopted this point from the ancient Indian ascetics who predated both religions.</td>
<td>《义注》进一步指出，损坏 bījagāma 会导致《突吉罗》。《经分别》并没有提到这一点，但《义注》引用了多部经典（如<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N06n0004_002">《长部》2经</a>）中的出现的一段话作为其依据，这段话指出，戒德圆满的比丘不会伤害 bhūtagāma 和 bījagāma 。在这样做时，《义注》利用了《小品》的总括戒条，所有不良习惯都违犯《突吉罗》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_015#0190a11">《小品》.五.36</a>）。《大品》和《小品》在两段关于比丘吃水果的段落中对《义注》的断言提供了进一步但部分的证明，我们将在下面讨论。耆那教苦行者也遵循类似的戒律，显示佛教徒和耆那教徒都从早于这两种宗教的古印度苦行者那里采纳了这一观点。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Furthermore, according to the Commentary, there are certain kinds of plants that do not count either as bhūtagāma or bījagāma under this rule, and to damage them entails no offense. To justify this point it quotes a passage from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.1.2-5">Cv.VIII.1.3</a>: “If a wall treated with ochre… (or) a finished floor is moldy (§), one should moisten a rag, wring it out, and wipe it clean.” The Commentary extends the Canon’s instructions here to cover not only mold on walls but also other lower forms of plant life—such as algae on the inside of water jars, fungus on toothbrushes, and mold on food—that would count as filth if they were allowed to continue growing.</td>
<td>此外，根据《义注》，有些植物根据这条戒条既不算是 bhūtagāma，也不算是 bījagāma，损坏它们并不构成犯戒。为了证明这一点，它引用了<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_018#0286a10">《小品》.八.1.3</a> 中的一段话：「如果用赭石处理过的墙壁……（或）所作地面发霉了（§），则应将抹布弄湿，拧干，然后擦拭干净。」《义注》扩展了《圣典》的指示，不仅涵盖了墙壁上的霉菌，还涵盖了其他低等植物生命形式—例如水罐内部的藻类、牙刷上的真菌和食物上的霉菌—如果允许它们继续生长，则将被视为污秽。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Vibhaṅga, the term <em>damaging</em> includes such actions as cutting, breaking, and cooking, as well as getting other people to perform these actions. The Commentary defines <em>damaging</em> as “dealing with a plant as one likes by cutting it, breaking it, and so on.” Although the word for <em>dealing with</em>—<em>paribhuñjati</em>—literally means “making use of,” the Commentary’s illustrations of what this covers include even such things as shaking a tree limb to get the dry leaves to fall off so that one can sweep them up. Thus, it says, <em>damaging</em> would include picking flowers or leaves, uprooting a plant, engraving one’s initials in a tree trunk, etc. Because no exception is made for doing such things with “benevolent” intentions toward the plant, pruning would be included as well. Given the catch-all nature of the Commentary’s definition, using herbicides to kill plants would also come under <em>damaging</em>.</td>
<td>根据《经分别》，<em>损害</em>包括切割、破坏、烹饪等行为，以及让其他人执行这些行为。《义注》将<em>损害</em>定义为「以切割、破坏等方式随意对待植物」。尽管表示<em>对待—paribhuñjati</em>—的单字字面意思是「利用」，《义注》中对此内容的说明甚至包括诸如摇晃树枝让干树叶掉落以便可以将其扫起之类的事情。因此，它说，<em>损害</em>包括采摘花朵或叶子、拔除植物、在树干上刻上自己的姓名首字母等。因为对植物怀著「仁慈的」意图做这些事没有豁免，所以修剪也包括在内。鉴于《义注》定义的包罗万象性，使用除草剂杀死植物也算<em>损害</em>。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that plants growing in water, such as water hyacinths, whose roots do not extend to the earth beneath the water, have the water as their base. To remove them from the water is to damage them, although there is no offense in moving them around in the water. To move them from one body of water to another without incurring a penalty, one may take them together with some of the water in which they originally lived and place them together with that water into the new body of water.</td>
<td>《义注》还补充道，水葫芦等生长在水中的植物，其根部不会延伸到水下的土地，而是以水为基部。将它们从水中取出是损害它们，尽管在水中移动它们并没有犯戒。为了将它们从一个水域移到另一个水域而不受到惩罚，可以将它们连同它们原来生活的部分水一起带入新的水域。</td>

<tr><td>Because fruit seeds are bījagāma, the question arises as to how bhikkhus should go about eating fruit. The Commentary to this rule discusses in detail two passages, one each in the Mahāvagga (VI. 21) and the Cullavagga (V.5.2), dealing with precisely this question. The Cullavagga passage reads, “I allow you, bhikkhus, to consume fruit that has been made allowable for monks in any of five ways: if it is damaged by fire, by a knife, by a fingernail, if it is seedless, and the fifth is if the seeds are discharged.” The Mahāvagga passage reads, “Now at that time there was a great quantity of fruit at Sāvatthī, but there was no one to make it allowable…. (The Buddha said,) ‘I allow that fruit that is seedless or whose seeds are discharged be consumed (even if) it has not been made allowable.”</td>
<td>因为水果种子是 bījagāma，所以就出现了比丘应该如何吃水果的问题。本戒条的《义注》详细讨论了两个段落，一段在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0286a04">《大品》（六.21）</a>，一段在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_015#0148a04">《小品》（五.5.2）</a>，专门处理这个问题。《小品》段落中写道：「我允许你们，诸比丘，以五种方式中的任一种方式食用已经为沙门作净的水果：如果它被火损坏、被刀子损坏、被指甲损坏、如果是无籽的、第五种是如果籽被排出。」《大品》段落写道：「当时舍卫城有许多水果，但没有人作净……（佛陀说）『我允许吃没有籽的水果，或者籽排出的水果，（即使）它没有被作净。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>First, to summarize the commentaries’ discussion of seedless fruit and fruit whose seeds have been discharged: According to the Commentary to the Mahāvagga, <em>seedless fruit</em> includes fruit whose seeds are too immature to grow. As for fruit whose seeds have been discharged, the Sub-commentary states that this means, “Fruit, such as mangoes or jackfruit, which it is possible to eat having removed the seeds and separating them entirely (from the flesh).”</td>
<td>首先，总结一下注释书中对无籽水果和籽已排出的水果的讨论：根据《大品》的《义注》，<em>无籽水果</em>包括种子未成熟而无法生长的水果。至于种子已排出的水果，《复注》指出，这意味著「诸如芒果或菠萝蜜之类的水果，可以去掉种子并将它们完全（与果肉）分离后再食用。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question sometimes arises as to whether bhikkhus may remove the seeds themselves before eating fruit of this sort, or if an unordained person has to remove them first. Given the context of the Mahāvagga passage and the wording of the Sub-commentary’s explanation, it seems clear that the bhikkhus themselves may discharge the seeds before or while eating the fruit. As the Commentary notes, both these kinds of fruit are allowable in and of themselves, and need not go through any other procedure to make them allowable.</td>
<td>有时会出现这样的问题：比丘是否可以在吃这种水果之前自己去掉种子，或者是否必须由未受具足戒的人先去掉种子。考虑到《大品》段落的上下文和《复注》解释的措辞，似乎很明显比丘自己可以在吃水果之前或吃水果时排出种子。正如《义注》所指出的，这两种水果本身都是允许的，不需要经过任何其他作净程序。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Other kinds of fruit, though, such as those with numerous seeds (such as tomatoes and blackberries) or whose seeds would be difficult to remove undamaged (such as grapes) must be damaged by fire, a knife, or a fingernail before a bhikkhu may eat them. The Commentary’s description of how to do this shows that the damaging need only be symbolic: An unordained person draws a hot object or a knife across the skin of the fruit, or pokes it with a fingernail, saying “allowable” <em>(kappiyaṁ)</em> either while doing the damaging or immediately afterward. The Sub-commentary notes that the word for “allowable” may be stated in any language.</td>
<td>然而，其他种类的水果，例如带有大量种子的水果（例如蕃茄和黑莓）或难以去除而不损害种子的水果（例如葡萄），必须用火、刀或指甲损害后，比丘才能食用。《义注》中对如何做到这一点的描述表明，损害只需要是象征性的：一个未受具足戒的人用一个热物体或一把刀划过水果皮，或者用指甲戳它，在损害的同时或之后立即说「允许的」<em>（kappiyaṁ）</em>。《复注》指出，「允许的」一词可以用任何语言表达。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If a heap of fruit, such as grapes, is brought to a bhikkhu, he should say, “Make it allowable,” <em>(Kappiyaṁ karohi,)</em> either to the donor or to any other unordained person who knows how. The unordained person need only make one of the grapes allowable in line with the above procedures for the entire heap to be considered allowable, although he/she should not remove the grape from the heap while doing so.</td>
<td>如果一堆水果（例如葡萄）被带给比丘，他应该对布施者或任何其他知道如何做的未受具足戒者说「使其被允许」<em>（Kappiyaṁ karohi）</em>。未受具足戒者只需按照上述程序作净其中一颗葡萄，整堆葡萄即可被视为已作净，但他/她在如此做时不应将该葡萄从葡萄堆中取出。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Sub-commentary claims that the ceremony of making fruit allowable must always be performed in the presence of a bhikkhu, but the Commentary mentions this factor only in connection with this last case—making an entire heap of fruit allowable by “damaging” only one piece—and not in its basic description of how the procedure is done.</td>
<td>《复注》声称，作净水果的仪式必须始终在比丘面前进行，但《义注》仅在与最后一种情况相关时提到了这一因素——通过「损坏」一块水果来作净整堆水果——而不是在对如何进行该程序的基本描述中提到了这一点。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In Communities that follow the Sub-commentary, the custom is as follows: When a donor brings grapes, tomatoes, or similar fruit to a bhikkhu, the bhikkhu says, “<em>Kappiyaṁ karohi</em> (Make it allowable).” The donor damages the fruit in any of the three specified ways and says, “<em>Kappiyaṁ bhante</em> (It is allowable, venerable sir),” while doing the damaging, and then presents the fruit to the bhikkhu.</td>
<td>在遵循《复注》的僧团中，习俗如下：当施主带给比丘葡萄、蕃茄或类似的水果时，比丘会说「<em>Kappiyaṁ karohi</em>（使其被允许）」。施主以三种指定方式中的一种损害水果，并在损害时说：「<em>Kappiyaṁ bhante</em>（这是允许的，尊者）」，然后将水果呈给比丘。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In Communities that do not follow the Sub-commentary, the donor may perform the act of damaging the fruit beforehand. If the damage is obvious, a bhikkhu may accept and consume the fruit without asking. If it’s not, he should ask whether it has been damaged. If the reply is Yes, he may accept and consume it. If No, it should first be damaged in his presence.</td>
<td>在不遵循《复注》的僧团中，施主可以事先进行损害水果的行为。如果损害很明显，比丘可以接受并食用水果而无需询问。如果不明显，他应该询问它是否已被损害。如果答案是肯定的，他可以接受并食用它。如果不是，则应先在他面前将其损害。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Even in this second type of Community, however, the act of making a heap of fruit allowable by damaging only one piece <em>must</em> be done in a bhikkhu’s presence. And we should note again that seedless fruit or fruit whose seeds may be removed entirely from the flesh of the fruit are allowable in and of themselves, and do not have to go through any procedure before a bhikkhu may accept and eat them.</td>
<td>然而，即使在第二种类型的僧团中，透过损害一块水果来作净一堆水果的行为<em>必须</em>在比丘面前进行。我们应该再次注意，无籽水果或可以将种子从果肉中完全去除的水果本身是允许的，并且不需要经过任何程序，比丘就可以接受和食用它们。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The two passages in the Mahāvagga and Cullavagga that we have been discussing deal specifically only with fruit, but the Commentary extrapolates from them to say that the same conditions apply to other forms of bījagāma, such as sugar cane and bean sprouts as well.</td>
<td>我们一直在讨论的《大品》和《小品》中的两个段落仅仅专门讨论了水果，但《义注》从中推断，同样的情况也适用于其他形式的 bījagāma，例如甘蔗和豆芽。</td>

In this case, if the bhikkhu continues to be evasive or remain silent out of a desire to hide his offenses, he incurs another dukkaṭa. In the second situation, the bhikkhu does not deserve the charge—for instance, he has asked questions or remained silent for one of the allowable reasons, but the Community has abused its powers in bringing the charge against him. In this case, if he continues to ask questions or remain silent for the allowable reasons, he incurs no offense.</td>

For example, if he assigns the best dwellings to certain bhikkhus simply because he likes them, gives the poorest food to certain bhikkhus simply because he dislikes them, habitually sends the wrong bhikkhus to the wrong meals because he is too stupid to handle the rotating rosters properly, or gives the best treatment to certain bhikkhus because he is afraid of them or their supporters, there is no offense in criticizing his behavior in the presence of others.</td>
<td>如上所述，如果僧团执事习惯性地出于四种偏见原因（贪、瞋、痴、恐惧）中的任何一种而采取行动，批评或抱怨他并没有犯戒。例如，如果他仅仅因为喜欢某些比丘而为他们安排最好的住所，仅仅因为不喜欢某些比丘而为他们提供最差的食物，或者因为他太愚蠢而无法妥善处理轮值表而习惯性地将错误的比丘安排到错误的餐食中，或者因为他害怕某些比丘或他们的支持者而给予他们最好的待遇，那么在他人面前批评他的行为并没有犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>The reason for this allowance is that one of the qualifying factors for a Community official is that he be unbiased (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>). Thus any complaint of bias would be tantamount to an accusation that the Community transaction authorizing him as an official was invalid, and the Community would then be duty bound to look into the matter.</td>
<td>允许此开缘的原因是，担任僧团执事的资格条件之一就是他必须公正无私（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教比丘戒律 第二册》第十八章</a>）。因此，任何有关偏见的投诉都等于指控授权他担任执事的僧团羯磨无效，因此僧团有义务调查此事。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>However, one should be very sure of the facts of the case before taking advantage of this allowance, for—as noted above—perception is not a mitigating factor under this rule. Disappointment and anger have a way of coloring one’s perceptions, making another person’s perfectly blameless behavior look biased and unjust. If one criticizes or complains about an official, thoroughly convinced that he has been acting out of bias, one is still guilty of an offense if it turns out that in fact the official’s behavior has been fair. The same considerations apply also to complaints or criticisms concerning anyone, ordained or not.</td>
<td>然而，在利用这项开缘之前，应该非常清楚真实情况，因为──如上所述──根据这条戒条，感知并不是减轻惩罚的因素。失望和愤怒会影响一个人的看法，使另一个人完全无可指责的行为看起来有偏见和不公正。如果批评或抱怨某个执事，并且完全相信该执事的行为带有偏见，那么如果事实证明该执事的行为是公正的，仍然犯了戒。同样的考虑也适用于对任何人的抱怨或批评，无论是否受具足戒。</td>

<tr><td>The job of a Community official is often a thankless one. The procedures he must follow in distributing invitations, etc., can be fairly complex and, in large Communities, quite time-consuming. Because there is no way he can guarantee equal treatment to all, there may be times when he seems to be acting out of bias when he is simply following standard procedure. If he cannot receive the benefit of the doubt from his fellow bhikkhus, there is no incentive for him to undertake these duties in the first place. The Buddha likened material gains to excrement (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN5_196.html">AN 5:196</a>), and when excrement is shared out there is rarely any point in complaining about who gets the choicest portions.</td>
<td>僧团执事的工作往往是吃力不讨好的工作。分配邀请等等他必须遵循的程序可能相当复杂，并且在大型僧团中相当耗时。因为他无法保证对所有人都相同待遇，所以有时他只是在遵循标准程序，但却显得带有偏见。如果他不能得到同侪比丘们的假定信任，那么他一开始就没有动力去承担这些职责。佛陀将物质利益比喻为排泄物（参考<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/zcj/zengzhi/content/1056.html">《增支部》5:196经</a>），当排泄物被分享时，抱怨谁得到了最好的部分几乎没有任何意义。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>departing the furnishings</em> as going further than one <em>leḍḍupāta</em>—approximately 18 meters—from them. It does not define “taking leave,” aside from stating that one may take leave from a bhikkhu, a novice, or a monastery attendant. This much, however, establishes that even though the Pali verb for taking leave, <em>āpucchati</em>, is etymologically related to the verb for asking, <em>pucchati</em>, the act of taking leave does <em>not</em> mean asking permission, for nothing in the Canon suggests that a bhikkhu has to get a novice’s or a lay attendant’s permission for his actions. The Commentary expands on this point, saying that <em>taking leave</em> means informing a bhikkhu, a novice, or a temple attendant whom one assumes will take responsibility for the furnishings. Unlike the following rule, where the intent to return is a mitigating factor, here it is not: Once a bhikkhu has departed from the furnishings, he has completed the factor of effort here even if he intends to return immediately.</td>
<td>《经分别》将<em>离开家具</em>定义为距离其超过一个 <a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/l/le%E1%B8%8D%E1%B8%8Dup%C4%81ta/">leḍḍupāta</a> （约 18 公尺）。它没有对「告别」做出定义，只是说可以向比丘、沙弥或寺院侍者告别。然而，这表明，尽管巴利语中表示告别的动词 <em>āpucchati</em> 在词源上与表示询问的动词 <em>pucchati</em> 相关，但告别的行为并<em>不</em>意味著请求许可，因为《圣典》中没有任何内容表明比丘必须获得沙弥或在家侍者的许可才能采取行动。《义注》对这一点进行了扩展，指出<em>告别</em>意味著通知比丘、沙弥或寺院侍者，并认为他们会对家具负责。与下一条戒条不同，在下一条戒条中，返回的意图是一个减轻惩罚因素，但这里不是：一旦比丘离开了家具，即使他打算立即返回，他也已完成了此处的努力因素。</td>

<tr><td>Bedding left in a dwelling, etc., belonging to oneself is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>将寝具留在属于自己的住所等处不构成犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Vibhaṅga, this rule applies specifically to bedding that one has oneself set out or arranged to be set out. Thus it would not apply to cases where a bhikkhu comes to a dwelling and finds bedding already set out there, even when set out as a courtesy for him. The Commentary qualifies this point by saying that if a visiting bhikkhu is staying temporarily in a Community dwelling to which another bhikkhu has laid claim (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>), the bedding is the responsibility of the bhikkhu with the claim on the dwelling, and not of the visitor. Once the visitor does lay claim to the dwelling, however, responsibility for the bedding becomes his. In line with this qualification, if a monastery has a dwelling set aside for receiving visiting elders, it would be a wise policy for one of the resident bhikkhus to lay claim to it so that visiting elders would not have to be responsible for any bedding set out for them.</td>
<td>根据《经分别》，这条戒条专门适用于自己摆放或安排令人摆放的寝具。因此，这不适用于比丘来到住处并发现那里已经摆放好寝具的情况，即使是出于对他的礼貌而摆放的寝具。《义注》中对此进行了限定，指出如果一位来访的比丘暂时住在另一位比丘声称居住的僧团住处（见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教比丘戒律 第二册》第十八章</a>），则寝具是声称居住该住处的比丘的责任，而不是访客的责任。然而，一旦访客确实对该住处提出声称居住，寝具的责任就落到访客身上了。依照这项条件，如果一座寺院专门为接待来访的长老而设立了住处，那么明智的做法是让其中一位常住比丘声称居住该住处，这样来访的长老就不必负责为他们摆放的寝具。</td>

Thus, if the bedding was hanging in a bundle from a clothesline before being spread out, it should be wrapped in a bundle and hung from the line as before. If it was taken from another room, it should be returned to the room from which it was taken.</td>
<td>《义注》中关于<em>收起物品</em>的讨论表明，它本质上意味著将其放回被展开之前保存的安全地方。因此，如果寝具在被展开之前是捆成一捆挂在晾衣绳上的，则应将其包捆起来并像之前一样挂在晾衣绳上。如果是从另一个房间拿走的，则应将其放回被拿走的房间。</td>

<tr><td>To <em>depart</em> is defined as going outside the grounds of the monastery: beyond the wall of the monastery if it is walled, beyond its vicinity if it is not. (In all rules mentioning this point, the Commentary defines a monastery’s vicinity as a distance of two leḍḍupātas—approximately 36 meters—from the buildings.) However, the absence of any reference to this rule in the protocols to be done before one’s alms round (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.5.2-3">Cv.VIII.5</a>—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#BMC2chapter9">BMC2, Chapter 9</a>) indicates that temporary excursions outside the monastery are not counted as “departing.” This conclusion is seconded by one of the non-offense clauses here, discussed below, which says that when a bhikkhu goes with the expectation of returning but then sends word back to the monastery that he is taking leave, he avoids any penalty under this rule. This implies that a bhikkhu who leaves his bedding spread out in a dwelling belonging to the Community, leaves the monastery temporarily with the intent of returning, and returns as planned, incurs no penalty as well.</td>
<td><em>离开</em>的定义是走出寺院的范围：如果寺院有围墙，则走出寺院围墙之外；如果没有围墙，则走出寺院周围。（在所有提到这一点的戒条中，《义注》都将寺院的附近定义为距离建筑物两个 <a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/l/le%E1%B8%8D%E1%B8%8Dup%C4%81ta/">leḍḍupāta</a>（约 36 米）的距离。）然而，在托钵前需作持的行仪中没有提到这条戒条（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_018#0293a14">《小品》.八.5</a> ——参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#BMC2chapter9">《佛教比丘戒律 第二册》第九章</a>），这表明寺院外的临时出游不算作「离开」。这一结论得到了下面讨论的其中一条不犯条款的支持，该条款规定，当一位比丘带著返回的期望出去，但随后又向寺院传回话说他要告别时，他可以避免根据这条戒条受到任何惩罚。这意味著，如果比丘将自己的寝具展开留在僧团的住所中，暂时离开寺院并打算返回，并且按照计划返回，那么他也不会受到惩罚。</td>

This point is conveyed by a passage in the non-offense clauses that reads, “having gone with the desire (to return), staying there one takes leave; he is constrained by something or another.” The Commentary, reasonably, reads this passage as two exemptions governed by the first phrase. In other words, (1) if one leaves the monastery with the intent to return and then, after reaching the opposite bank of a river or going the interval of one village away, one changes one’s mind and decides not to return, one can avoid an offense by sending word back to the monastery with the message that one is taking leave. Or, (2) if one leaves the monastery with the intent to return but encounters physical constraints—such as flooded rivers, kings, or robbers—that prevent one’s return, that in and of itself exempts one from an offense, and there is no need to send word.</td>
<td>在此处是一个因素，因为——如上所述——如果计划在允许的时间内返回，那就没有犯戒。不犯条款中的一段话传达了这一点，写道「带著（返回的）愿望去，留在那里告别，他受到某些事物的束缚。」《义注》合理地将这段话解读为受第一句约束的两项豁免。换句话说，（1）如果离开寺院，打算返回，但到达河对岸，或走过一个村庄的距离后，改变主意，决定不再返回，只需向寺院传回话说要告别，即可避免犯戒。或者（2）如果离开寺院，打算返回，但遭遇身体限制——例如河水泛滥、国王或盗贼——阻止返回，这本身就免除了他的罪行，不需要传话。</td>

If one is not allowed at all to sit or lie down on a bed or bench with detachable legs on an unplanked loft, they say, there would be no reason to have one there. Actually, beds with detachable legs do not sound like wise things to have on an unplanked loft, and perhaps the Buddha’s purpose in formulating this rule was to discourage their being placed there in the first place.</td>
<td>有些人注意到，虽然起源故事中的比丘匆忙地坐下，但戒条中并没有出现「<em>匆忙地</em>」这个词，他们推测它可能被误删了。他们说，如果根本不允许在未铺地板的阁楼上坐在或躺在有可拆卸脚的床或长椅上，那么就没有理由在那里放置可拆卸脚的床或长椅。实际上，在未铺地板的阁楼上放置带有可拆卸脚的床听起来并不是一个明智的事情，也许佛陀制定这条戒条的目的是为了阻止可拆卸脚的床一开始就被放置在那里。</td>

<tr><td>The area 1.25 meters around the door frame is to be covered with up to three layers of plaster or roofing material to reinforce it so that when the door is blown open or shut it will not damage the wall or be loosened from its hinges. Five kinds of roofing material are mentioned in the Vibhaṅga: tiles, stones, lime (cement), grass, and leaves.</td>
<td>门框周围 1.25 公尺的区域要覆盖最多三层灰泥或屋顶材料来加固，这样当门被风吹开或关闭时，它不会损坏墙壁或从铰链上松动。《经分别》中提到了五种屋顶材料：瓦片、石头、石灰（水泥）、草和树叶。</td>

<tr><td>Similarly, around the windows, an area the width of the window shutters is to be reinforced with up to three layers of plaster to protect it from being damaged when the shutters are blown open or shut. Three kinds of plaster were used in the Buddha’s time—white, black, and ochre—and bhikkhus were allowed to apply them in a number of geometrical patterns, but not to use them to make obscene pictures of men and women on the walls (!) (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0045.html#Cv.VI.3.1">Cv.VI.3.1-2</a>). Although the bhikkhus were allowed to cover the entire walls and floor with this plaster, this rule gives directions only for the minimum area that should be covered to keep the walls strong.</td>
<td>同样，在窗户周围，与百叶窗宽度相同的区域需要用最多三层灰泥加固，以保护百叶窗被吹开或关闭时受损。佛陀时代使用三种灰泥——白色、黑色和赭色——比丘们被允许用它们画出各种几何图案，但不允许用它们在墙上画出男人和女人的淫秽图画（！）（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_016#0206a01">《小品》.六.3.1-2</a>）。尽管比丘们被允许用这种灰泥覆盖整个墙壁和地板，但这条戒条给出了只为保持墙壁坚固而应覆盖的最小面积的指导。</td>

<tr><td>Because the rule refers to roofing material, the Commentary assumes that it must refer to the roof of the dwelling, even though this assumption does violence to the syntax of the rule. Its interpretation: One may reinforce the door and window frames with as much plaster or roofing material as one likes, but may cover the roof with only three layers of roofing material. A relevant point from the Canon is the passage at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.3.2-3">Cv.VIII.3.3</a> stating that if at a later date the roof begins to leak, the resident bhikkhu—if he can—should re-roof it himself or arrange for someone else to do it for him. If he can do neither, though, there is no offense.</td>
<td>因为本戒条涉及屋顶材料，所以《义注》假设它一定是指住处的屋顶，尽管这种假设违反了戒条的语法。它的解释是：可以用任意数量的灰泥或屋顶材料来加强门窗框架，但只能用三层屋顶材料覆盖屋顶。《圣典》中的一个相关点是 <a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_018#0289a14">《小品》.八.3.3</a> 中的一段话，其中指出，如果日后屋顶开始漏水，居住的比丘——如果可以的话——应该自己重新修缮屋顶，或者安排别人替他修缮。但如果这两件事他都做不到，那并不犯戒。</td>

<tr><td><strong>The reasons for this rule</strong></td>
<td><strong>制定此戒条的原因</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The origin story suggests that the Buddha imposed the three-layer limit in order to prevent the dwelling from collapsing under the weight of too much roofing material, but the non-offense clauses show clearly that the rule is aimed at preventing bhikkhus from abusing the generosity of the person sponsoring the building work. In either case, the Commentary’s interpretation has its logic, in that an overloaded roof would be more burdensome to the dwelling and to the sponsor than an overloaded window or door frame would be.</td>
<td>起源故事表明，佛陀规定三层限制是为了防止住处在过多的屋顶材料的重量下倒塌，但不犯条款清楚地表明，本戒条旨在防止比丘滥用赞助建筑工程的人的慷慨。无论哪种情况，《义注》的解释都有其逻辑，即超载的屋顶对于住处和赞助人来说比超载的窗户或门框更累赘。</td>

<tr><td>A supplementary regulation arising from the origin story is that one should not perform any building operations, including supervising, where crops are growing.</td>
<td>起源故事中出现的一个补充规定是，不应该在农作物生长的地方进行任何建筑作业，包括监督。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The offenses here are as follows: a pācittiya for each piece of roofing beyond the allowable three layers, and a dukkaṭa for doing or directing the work while standing where crops are growing. These offenses apply regardless of whether one is doing the work oneself or having it done. They also apply whether one is building a new dwelling or having an old one repaired.</td>
<td>这里的犯戒如下：屋顶超过允许的三层，每超过一层就要犯一次《波逸提》，站在农作物生长的地方进行或指挥工作，犯一次《突吉罗》。无论是自己做还是让人做，这些犯戒都适用。无论是建造新住处还是修缮旧住处，这些都适用。</td>

<td>对于是否超出允许层数的感知在这里不是一个因素（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0016/#Pc4">《波逸提》四</a>）。</td>
