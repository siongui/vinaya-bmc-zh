<tr><td>The Dhamma and Vinaya impinge in such detail on so many areas of one’s life that no new bhikkhu can be expected to master them in a short time. For this reason, the Buddha arranged for a period of apprenticeship—called <em>nissaya</em>, or dependence—in which every newly ordained bhikkhu must train under the guidance of an experienced bhikkhu for at least five years before he can be considered competent to look after himself.</td>
<td>法与律对一个人生活的许多方面都有非常详细的影响，以至于不可能指望新比丘能在短时间内掌握它们。因此，佛陀安排了一段学徒期，称为“<em>nissaya</em>”或“依止”，每一位新出家的比丘必须在有经验的比丘的指导下修行至少五年，才可以被认为有能力照顾自己。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This apprenticeship has formed the human context in which the practice of the Buddha’s teachings has been passed down for the past 2,600 years. To overlook it is to miss one of the basic parameters of the life of the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus we will discuss it here first, before going on to the individual training rules of the Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>这种学徒期让佛陀教法薪传至今已将近二千六百年之久。忽视它就是错过法与律之生活的基本要素之一。因此，我们先在这里讨论它，然后再讨论《波罗提木叉》的个别学处。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Dependence is of two sorts: dependence on one’s preceptor (<em>upajjhāya</em>) and dependence on a teacher (<em>ācariya</em>). The relationships are similar—and in many details, identical—so the following discussion will use the word <em>mentor</em> to cover both preceptor and teacher wherever the pattern applies to both, and will distinguish them only where the patterns differ.</td>
<td>依止有两种：对戒师的依止（<em>upajjhāya</em>，古译为<em>和尚</em>）和对教授师的依止（<em>ācariya</em>，古译为<em>阿阇梨</em>）。这些关系是相似的，并且在许多细节上是相同的，因此下面的讨论，遇到二者通用相同的模式时，将使用<em>依止师</em>一词来涵盖戒师和教授师，并且仅在模式不同的地方区分戒师与教授师。</td>

<tr><td>Before ordination, one must choose a bhikkhu to act as one’s preceptor. The Mahāvagga (I.36-37) gives a long list of qualifications a bhikkhu must meet before he can act as a preceptor, while the Commentary divides the list into two levels: ideal and minimal qualifications. A bhikkhu who lacks the minimal qualifications incurs a dukkaṭa if he acts as a preceptor; a bhikkhu who meets the minimal but lacks the ideal qualifications is not an ideal person to give guidance, but he incurs no penalty in doing so.</td>
<td>在受具足戒之前，必须选择一位比丘作为自己的戒师。<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0082a01">《大品》（一.36-37）</a>给出了比丘在能成为戒师之前必须满足的一长串资格，而《义注》则将该列表分为两个层次：理想资格和最低资格。缺乏最低资格的比丘，如果他担任戒师，犯《突吉罗》。达到最低资格但缺乏理想资格的比丘不是给予指导的理想人选，但他担任戒师不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The ideal qualifications:</em> The preceptor should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release; and should be able to train another person to the same level of attainment. He should have faith, a sense of shame, a sense of compunction (in the American sense of the term, i.e., an reluctance to do wrong for fear of its consequences), persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness (according to the Sub-commentary, this means that he is constantly mindful of whatever mental object is before the mind). He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and be possessed of right view. (This last point, the Commentary says, means that he does not adhere to the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism.) He should be competent to tend to a sick pupil or to find someone who will tend to him, and to dispel dissatisfaction in a pupil who wants to leave the celibate life.</td>
<td><em>理想资格：</em>戒师应有阿罗汉的戒、定、慧、解脱、解脱知见；并且应该能够训练他人达到相同的成就。他应该有信心、惭、愧（此词在美式意义为因害怕后果而不愿做错事）、精进、不失正念（根据《复注》，这意味著他持续地正念于心面前的任何心理对象）。他应不违犯轻重诸戒，并且具足正见。（《义注》说，此处的正见意指不执著常见或断见这二种极端。）他应该有能力照顾生病的弟子或找到愿意照顾他的人，并且在弟子想离开梵行生活而还俗时，消除弟子的不满。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Mahāvagga does not say outright that these are ideal, as opposed to minimal, qualifications, but the Commentary offers as proof the fact that one of a pupil’s duties is to try to allay any dissatisfaction that may arise in his preceptor. If all preceptors were arahants, no case of this sort would ever arise and there would be no need to mention it. Thus the Commentary concludes that arahantship, although ideal in a preceptor, is not necessary.</td>
<td>《大品》并没有直截了当地说，相对于最低资格，这些是理想资格，但《义注》提供了这样一个事实作为证据：弟子的职责之一是尽力减轻他的戒师可能产生的任何不满。如果所有比丘都是阿罗汉，这种事就不会发生，也不用提及。因此，《义注》的结论是，阿罗汉果虽然对戒师来说是理想的，但并不是必要的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The minimal qualifications:</em> The preceptor must be learned and competent. According to the Commentary, this means that he knows enough of the Dhamma and Vinaya to govern a following and is competent enough to know what is and is not an offense. He must also be competent enough to allay, in line with the Dhamma, any anxiety that has arisen in his pupil; must know what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. He must have detailed knowledge of both Pāṭimokkhas (the one for the bhikkhus and the one for the bhikkhunīs) and be able to train the pupil in the bhikkhus’ customs (Com.: this means that he knows the Khandhakas), in the basic rules of the chaste life (Sub-com.: he knows both Vibhaṅgas), the higher Dhamma, and the higher Vinaya. He must be able, in line with the Dhamma, to pry his pupil away from a wrong view or to find someone who will help pry him away. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for ten years or more.</td>
<td><em>最低资格：</em>依止师必须博学且有能力。根据《义注》，这意味著他对法与律有足够的了解来管理追随者，并且有足够的能力知道什么是犯戒和不是犯戒。他还必须有足够的能力，按照法，减轻弟子中出现的任何焦虑；必须知道什么是犯戒，什么是不犯戒，什么是轻罪，什么是重罪，以及忏罪的方法。他必须详细了解两部《波罗提木叉》（比丘的一部和比丘尼的一部），并且能够训练弟子遵循比丘的习俗（《义注》：这意味著他了解《犍度》），遵循梵行生活的基本戒条（《复注》：他知道两部《经分别》），更高的法和更高的律。他必须能够按照法，使弟子远离邪见，或找到能帮助他脱离邪见的人。而且──最基本的要求──他必须出家为比丘十年或以上。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, for some reason, the new bhikkhu lives in a separate monastery from his preceptor, he must take dependence under a teacher, whose qualifications are precisely the same as those for a preceptor. Because the Mahāvagga (I.72.1) gives a dukkaṭa for taking dependence under an unconscientious bhikkhu, the new bhikkhu is allowed four to five days to observe his potential teacher’s conduct before taking dependence under him (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html#Mv.I.72">Mv.I.72.2</a>).</td>
<td>如果因为某些原因，新比丘与戒师住在不同的寺院，他就必须依止一位教授师，而教授师的资格与戒师的资格完全相同。因为<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0114a10">《大品》（一.72.1）</a>提到，依止一个不负责任的比丘，犯《突吉罗》，所以新比丘在依止之前可以有四到五天的时间来观察他潜在的教授师的行为（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0114a14">《大品》.一.72.2</a>）。</td>

The Vinaya-mukha tries to reduce these duties to a few general principles, but this misses much of what the Mahāvagga has to offer, for the details are what show fine examples of mindfulness in action—the best way to fold a robe, clean a dwelling, and so forth—as well as indications of how one can use this aspect of one’s training to develop sensitivity to the needs of others. Still, the detailed instructions are so extensive that they would overburden the discussion in this chapter, so I have saved them for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixX">Appendix X</a>.

<td><em>1. 关注依止师的个人需求。</em> 《大品》对这个主题进行了非常详细的阐述，对于弟子为依止师服务的每一种可能的方式都给出了精确的指示。《戒律入口》试图将这些职责简化为一些一般原则，但这错过了《大品》所提供的大部分内容，因为细节是正念在行动中的典范——折叠袈裟、打扫住所等的最佳方法——以及如何利用训练的这一方面来培养对他人需求的敏感度的指示。尽管如此，详细的说明是如此广泛，以至于它们会使本章的讨论负担过重，因此我将它们保存在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixX">附录十</a>中。在这里，我将简单地以概要形式给出它们。弟子应该：<!-- TODO FIXME: replace link to 附录十 -->

<tr><td>g. Study the Dhamma and Vinaya from him when he is prepared to teach. (The Mahāvagga describes this as “recitation” and “interrogation.” Recitation, according to the Commentary, means learning to memorize passages; interrogation, learning to investigate their meaning.)</td>
<td>g. 当依止师拟给予教导时，弟子应听受研学法与律。（《大品》将其描述为「诵」和「问」。根据《义注》，「诵」的意思是学习记忆段落；「问」是学习探究其意义。）</td>

<tr><td><em>2. Assisting the mentor in any problems he may have with regard to the Dhamma and Vinaya.</em> The Mahāvagga lists the following examples:</td>
<td><em>2. 协助依止师解决有关法与律的任何问题。</em>《大品》列出了以下例子：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>a. If the mentor begins to feel dissatisfaction with the celibate life, the pupil should try to allay that dissatisfaction or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.</td>

<tr><td>b. If the preceptor begins to feel anxiety over his conduct with regard to the rules, the pupil should try to dispel that anxiety or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.</td>
<td>b. 如果戒师开始对自己遵守戒律的行为感到焦虑，弟子应该设法消除其焦虑，或者找其他可以消除其焦虑的人，或者给予他法的开示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>c. If the preceptor begins to hold to wrong views, the pupil should try to pry him away from those views or find someone else who can, or give him a Dhamma talk.</td>
<td>c. 如果戒师开始持有邪见，弟子应该设法规劝他放弃邪见，或者找其他可以规劝他放弃邪见的人，或者给予他法的开示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>d. If the preceptor has committed a saṅghādisesa offense, the pupil should—to the best of his ability—help with the arrangements for penance, probation, and rehabilitation, or find someone else who can.</td>
<td>d. 如果戒师犯了《僧残》罪，弟子应该尽其所能帮助安排别住（parivāsa）、摩那埵(mānatta)、与出罪(abbhāna)，或找其他可以帮助的人。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>e. If the Community is going to carry out a transaction against the mentor, the pupil should try to dissuade them from it. According to the Commentary, this means that he should go to the various members of the Community individually before the meeting and try to dissuade them from going through with the transaction. If he can’t dissuade them, he should try to get them to lessen its severity (say, from banishment to censure). If they are justified in carrying out the transaction, though, he should not object while the meeting is in progress. Once they have carried out the transaction, he should concentrate on helping his mentor behave so that they will rescind the transaction as quickly as possible.</td>
<td>e. 如果僧团要对依止师施行羯磨，弟子应该尽力劝阻他们。根据《义注》，这意味著他应该在僧团集会之前单独去找僧团的各个成员，并试图劝阻他们施行羯磨。如果他无法劝阻他们，他应该设法让他们减轻其严重程度（例如，从驱出羯磨减为呵责羯磨）。不过，如果他们有正当理由施行羯磨，他不应该在僧团集会进行中提出反对。一旦羯磨完成，他就应该专注于帮助他的依止师遵从僧团决议守规矩，以便他们尽快解除羯磨。</td>

<tr><td><em>3. Washing, making, and dyeing the mentor’s robes.</em></td>
<td><em>3. 依止师袈裟的洗涤、缝制、染色。</em></td>

<tr><td>a. The pupil should neither give nor receive gifts, nor give or receive services to/from others without first obtaining the mentor’s permission. According to the Commentary, <em>others</em> here means people who are on bad terms with the mentor.</td>
<td>a. 未得到依止师的允许之前，弟子不应赠送物品给他人，或接受他人赠送的物品，亦不应奉事他人或接受他人的奉事。根据《义注》，这里的「他人」意指：与依止师关系不睦的人。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>b. The pupil should obtain his mentor’s permission before entering a village, going to a cemetery (to meditate, says, the Commentary), or leaving the district in which they live. The Commentary notes, though, that if the mentor refuses one’s request the first time, one should ask up to two more times, presenting one’s reasons as best one can. If the mentor still refuses, the pupil should reflect on his situation. If staying with the mentor is not helping his education and meditation, and if the mentor seems to want him to stay simply to have someone to look after his (the mentor’s) needs, the pupil is justified in leaving and taking dependence with a new mentor in his new residence.</td>
<td>b. 弟子必须得到依止师的允许之后，才能入村庄、入墓地（《义注》说：去修行）或离开共住的区域。然而，《义注》指出：如果依止师拒绝弟子第一次的请求，弟子应当再请求最多两次，并尽可能地陈述自己的理由。如果依止师仍然拒绝，弟子应反思自己的情况，如果继续与依止师共住对自己的教育与修行没有帮助，而依止师要弟子留下似乎只是因为需要人奉事，如此，弟子有正当理由离开，并在新住处依止新的依止师。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, a pupil is freed from these duties when he is ill. Otherwise, he should observe all the above duties to his preceptor as long as he is in dependence on him. It adds that the duties in sections 1-3 are incumbent on the pupil even after he is released from dependence, as long as both he and the preceptor are alive and still ordained, although not every Community follows the Commentary on this point.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，弟子生病时可以免除这些职责。否则，只要他依止戒师，他就应该履行对戒师的所有上述职责。它补充说，即使在弟子免除依止之后，只要他和戒师都活著并且仍然是比丘身分，第 1-3 节中的职责也是弟子必须履行的，尽管并非每个僧团都在这一点上遵循《义注》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the duties to one’s teacher, the Commentary lists four types of teachers: the going-forth teacher (the one who gives one the ten precepts during one’s ordination ceremony); the acceptance teacher (the one who chants the motion and proclamations during the ceremony); the Dhamma teacher (the one who teaches one the Pali language and Canon); and the dependence teacher (the one with whom one lives in dependence). With the dependence teacher and Dhamma teacher, one must observe all the above duties only as long as one is living in dependence on him. As for the other two, the Commentary adds that one should observe sections 1-3 as long as both parties are alive and still ordained—although, again, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point.</td>
<td>至于对教授师的职责，《义注》列举了四种教授师：出家教授师（受具足戒仪式中，授与十戒者）；羯磨教授师（受具足戒仪式中，宣读白四羯磨文者）；佛法教授师（教授巴利语和《圣典》者）；以及依止教授师（依止共住者）。对于依止教授师和佛法教授师，只有当弟子依止共住时，才必须履行所有上述职责。至于另外两者，《义注》补充说，只要双方都活著并且仍然是比丘身分，就应该履行第 1-3 节——尽管并非所有僧团都在这一点上遵循《义注》。<!-- https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E9%97%8D%E9%BB%8E

三师与七证师之并称。指比丘受具足戒时，戒场中必须具足之戒师人数。又作十师、十僧。三师即：(一)戒和尚，指正授戒律之和尚。乃比丘得戒之根本及其归投处，故必至诚三请之。凡担任戒和尚者，其戒腊须在十年以上，并严守戒法，具足智慧，堪能教授弟子。(二)羯磨师，即读羯磨文之阿阇梨，主持白四羯磨授戒仪式。羯磨师为诸比丘受戒之正缘，若无羯磨师秉承圣法，则法界善法无从生起。担任此职者，其戒腊须在五年以上。(三)教授师，即教授威仪作法，为众人引导开解者。其戒腊亦须在五年以上。七证师则指证明受戒之七位莅会比丘。凡此十师均须于受戒前恭请之。
在印度、中国，佛教较盛行而人口较稠密的「中国」地区，因其僧众极多，故有十师之规定，至于「边国」地区则仅须有三师二证等五师即可，此称为「中十边五」。然据云雨钞载，日本虽为海东之边国，却行「中国」之十师受戒之法。故日本之东大寺及唐招提寺戒坛，自古即行十师受戒之法。又受五戒时仅须和尚一人，受十戒时则须和尚、羯磨师二人即可。此外，湛然之授菩萨戒仪举出，大乘菩萨戒之请师法，则异于上述四分律所说。即以释迦如来为和尚，文殊为羯磨师，弥勒为教授师，一切如来为尊证师，一切菩萨为同学等侣；事实上担任教授者，唯有传教师一人。〔毘尼母经卷一、四分律卷三十一、五分律卷十七、摩诃僧祇律卷二十四〕（参阅「中国」1023） p595 -->

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if the mentor already has a pupil performing these duties for him, he may inform his remaining pupils that they need not take them on. This exempts them from having to observe them. If he neglects to do this, the pupil who is performing the duties may inform his fellows that he will take responsibility for looking after the mentor. This also exempts them. Otherwise, they incur a dukkaṭa for every duty they neglect to perform.</td>
<td>《义注》补充说，如果依止师已经有一名弟子对他履行这些职责，他可以告诉其余的弟子不需要履行这些职责。这豁免他们不必履行它们。如果依止师疏忽没有这样做，履行职责的弟子可以通知他的同伴，他将负责照顾依止师。这也豁免了他们的职责。否则，他们会因疏忽履行的每一项职责而犯一次《突吉罗》。</td>

Thus the mentor may, if he sees fit, inflict a non-physical punishment on the pupil before taking him back on the original footing, to make sure that he has actually seen the error of his ways. An example of such punishment, mentioned in the Vinaya-mukha, is simply asking to wait to observe the pupil’s behavior for a while to test whether his apology is sincere.</td>

If that doesn’t work, he should go stay in another monastery and take dependence under a senior bhikkhu there who is on congenial terms with the mentor, in hopes that the mentor will take this as a sign of the pupil’s good intentions and will eventually grant his forgiveness. If for some reason the pupil cannot stay at that other monastery, he may return to his original monastery and take dependence under another teacher.</td>

<tr><td>A bhikkhu on a journey is said to have no mentor available if no qualified senior bhikkhu is traveling with him. In other words, the fact that he happens to pass by a monastery containing a qualified mentor does not mean that a mentor is available, and he is allowed to continue traveling without taking dependence. If, however, he spends the night in a place where he has taken dependence before, he should take dependence on the day of his arrival. If he reaches a place where he has never been before and plans to spend only two or three days, he need not take dependence; but if he plans to spend a week, he must. If the senior bhikkhu he requests dependence from says, “What’s the use of taking dependence for only a week?” that exempts him from this requirement.</td>
<td>比丘在旅途中，如果没有合格的长老比丘与之同行，称为没有依止师。换句话说，他碰巧经过有一位合格的依止师的寺院，这并不意味著有依止师，他可以继续旅行而无需依止。然而，如果他在以前已经依止的地方过夜，他应该在到达的那天开始依止。如果他到了一个从未去过的地方，只打算待两三天，就不必依止；但如果他打算待一周，他就必须依止。如果他请求依止的长老比丘说：“只依止一周有什么用呢？” 这使他免除依止的要求。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the bhikkhu living alone in the wilderness, the Commentary says that “meditating comfortably” means that his tranquility and insight meditation are going smoothly. For some reason, though, it says that this allowance applies only to bhikkhus whose meditation is at a tender stage and might deteriorate if they were to leave the wilderness; if a bhikkhu has attained any of the noble attainments—beginning with stream-entry—he may not make use of this allowance. Why the Commentary limits the allowance in this way, it doesn’t say.</td>
<td>对于独居森林的比丘，《义注》说，「修行得很安稳」是指他的止观禅修进行得顺利。然而，出于某种原因，它说这项开缘只适用于禅修处于幼嫩阶段的比丘，如果离开森林，禅修可能会恶化。如果比丘已经证得任何圣果－从入流开始－他就不能使用这项开缘。《义注》并没有说为何如此限制开缘的理由。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, once the month before the Rains-residence (<em>vassa</em>) arrives and no suitable mentor appears, the junior bhikkhu must leave his wilderness abode and look for a place with a suitable mentor under whom he can take dependence for the Rains.</td>
<td>无论如何，一旦到了雨安居（<em>vassa</em>）前的那一个月，没有合适的依止师出现，低戒腊比丘就必须离开他的森林住所，寻找一个有合适依止师的地方，他可以在雨安居时依止之。</td>

<td>根据<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0100a02">《大品》.一.53.4</a>，受具足戒五年后，比丘可以解除依止，条件是他必须贤能通达。如果他还没有贤能通达，他就必须保持依止，直到他贤能通达。如果他一直无法变得贤能通达，他作为比丘的一生就必须保持依止。《义注》补充说，必须终身依止的比丘，如果找不到贤能通达的上座比丘，他就必须依止贤能通达的下座比丘。</td>

<tr><td>To be considered competent and experienced enough to deserve release from dependence, a bhikkhu must meet many of the same general qualifications as those for a mentor, except that he need not possess the competence to look after a pupil, and the minimum number of years he needs as a bhikkhu is five. None of the texts divide the qualifications here into ideal and minimal qualifications, as they do for the mentor, but it seems reasonable that the same division would apply here as well. This would give us the following list:</td>
<td>为了被认为有足够的贤能通达，得以解除依止，比丘必须满足许多与依止师相同的一般资格，除了他不需要具备照顾弟子的能力，以及做为比丘最少五年。没有任何文本像依止师一样，将这里的资格分为理想资格和最低资格，但同样的划分也适用于这里似乎是合理的。于是我们得以条列如下文：</td>

<tr><td><em>The ideal qualifications:</em> The bhikkhu should have an arahant’s virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision of release. He should have faith, a sense of shame, compunction, persistence in the practice, and quick mindfulness. He should be free of heavy and light offenses, and possess right view.</td>
<td><em>理想资格：</em>比丘应具备阿罗汉的戒、定、慧、解脱、解脱知见。他应该有信心、惭、愧、精进、不失正念。他应无重、轻诸罪，并且具足正见。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The minimal qualifications:</em> The bhikkhu must be learned and intelligent, knowing both Pāṭimokkhas in detail, understanding what is and is not an offense, what is a light offense, what is a heavy offense, and how an offense may be removed. And—the most basic requirement—he must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for at least five years (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html#Mv.I.53.5-9">Mv.I.53.5-13</a>).</td>
<td><em>最低资格：</em>比库必须博学且聪慧，娴熟通达二部《波罗提木叉》，了解什么是犯戒，什么是不犯戒，什么是轻罪，什么是重罪，以及如何忏罪。而且──最基本的要求──他必须受具足戒为比丘至少五年（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_001#0100a06">《大品》.一.53.5-13</a>）。</td>
