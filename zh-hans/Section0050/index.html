<tr><td>Well before the Buddha’s time there was a custom in India that wanderers would stay in place for the rainy season, both to avoid having to negotiate muddy roads and to avoid trampling plants. Bhikkhus in the early years of the Buddha’s teaching career were criticized by the Jains for not observing this custom, so the Buddha gave his permission for them to stop their wandering for three months of the Rains. Later he imposed a penalty for not observing this custom.</td>
<td>早在佛陀时代之前，印度就有一个习俗，就是游方者会在雨季待在原地，以避免行走泥泞的道路和踩踏植物。在佛陀早期的教化生涯中，比丘们因不遵守这项习俗而受到耆那教徒的批评，于是佛陀允许他们在雨季三个月内停止游方。后来，他对不遵守这项习俗施加惩罚。</td>

<tr><td>Because the rainy season in South Asia is roughly four months, bhikkhus are allowed to choose between two periods of Rains-residence: the first, starting the day after the full moon of the month of Asāḷhi (roughly July); and the second, starting the day after the following full moon. At present, the first Rains-residence starts on the full moon in July, or the second if there are two. Why the Buddha formulated two periods of Rains-residence, the Canon does not say. From the Commentary’s discussion of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.II.21.4">Mv.II.21.4</a>, it would appear that if one enters the first Rains and then, for one reason or another, “breaks” the Rains (see below) within the first month, one would still be eligible to enter the second Rains so as to receive the privileges contingent on its successful completion.</td>
<td>由于南亚的雨季大约有四个月，比丘们可以在两个雨安居时段之间进行选择：前雨安居，从 Asāḷhi 月（大约是七月）满月的次日开始；后雨安居，从下一个满月的次日开始。目前，前雨安居从七月的满月开始，如果有两个满月，则从第二个开始。至于佛陀为何要订定两个雨安居时段，《圣典》中并未说明。从《义注》对<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0158a11">《大品》.二.21.4</a> 的讨论来看，如果入前雨安居，然后因为某种原因在第一个月内「中断」了雨安居（见下文），仍然有资格入后雨安居，并在圆满完成之后获得方便利益。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the Buddha’s time, the determination of the lunar calendar was one of the responsibilities of the government in each kingdom or republic. Thus, to avoid controversy, the Buddha allowed that the wishes of kings be respected in this matter: If a king wanted to postpone the designation of the Asāḷhi full moon another month, bhikkhus were allowed to comply. (The rule coming from this origin story is stated in more general terms—“I allow that kings be complied with”—showing the general principle that we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0046.html#BMC2chapter7">Chapter 7</a>, that the Buddha was not so foolish as to try to legislate for kings. The Commentary notes, however, that this principle applies only in matters in which the king’s wish is in line with the Dhamma. No one, it says, should be complied with in matters where their wishes are not in line with the Dhamma.) At present, the governments of only a few countries concern themselves with calculating the lunar calendar for the sake of the general population. In other countries this point is not an issue, and the bhikkhus are free to calculate the lunar calendar without regard to the government’s calculations.</td>
<td>在佛陀时代，制定阴历是每个王国或共和国政府的职责之一。因此，为了避免争议，佛陀允许在此事上尊重国王的意愿：如果国王想将 Asāḷhi 满月的指定推迟一个月，比丘们被允许遵从。（源自此起源故事的戒条以更普遍的措辞表达——「我允许国王被遵从」——体现了我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0046.html#BMC2chapter7">第七章</a>中提到的普遍原则，即佛陀不会愚蠢到试图为国王立法。然而，《义注》指出，这一原则仅适用于国王意愿符合佛法的事上。它说，如果有人的意愿与佛法不符，就不应该在该事上遵从他。）目前，只有少数国家的政府会为了民众而计算阴历。在其他国家，这一点并不成问题，比丘们可以自由地计算阴历，而不必考虑政府的计算方式。</td>

<tr><td>The first day of the Rains-residence is when lodgings in a monastery are assigned for the duration of the Rains, so the Commentary recommends that a bhikkhu planning to spend the Rains in another monastery should start heading there a month before the start of the Rains so as not to inconvenience the assigner of lodgings and other bhikkhus there. As for bhikkhus planning to stay on in the monastery where they are already residing, they should spend the month before the beginning of the Rains preparing any worn-down buildings so that those who come for the Rains will study and/or practice meditation in comfort. The assigner of lodgings should assign lodgings for the Rains at dawn of the day the Rains begins. If other bhikkhus come later in the day and there are no extra spaces for them, they should be told that the lodgings have been assigned and that they should go to other lodgings, such as the foot of a tree. (What this means, apparently, is that they should enter the second Rains somewhere else, as the Canon contains a rule against entering the Rains in anything less than a proper dwelling. See below.)</td>
<td>雨安居的第一天是寺院分配雨安居住所的日子，因此《义注》建议，计划在其他寺院度过雨安居的比丘应在雨安居开始前一个月前往该寺院，以免给分配住所的人和寺院的其他比丘带来不便。至于计划继续留在现居寺院的比丘，他们应在雨安居开始前一个月整修任何破旧的建筑，以便前来雨安居的人能够舒适地学习和/或修行。分配住所的人应在雨安居开始当天黎明分配雨安居住所。如果其他比丘当天晚些时候到来，并且没有多余的空间，应告知他们住所已分配完毕，他们应前往其他住所，例如树下。（显然，这意味著他们应该在其他地方入后雨安居，因为《圣典》里戒条规定，不得在非合适住所入雨安居。见下文。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.III.4.2">Mv.III.4.2</a> states that on a day for beginning the Rains one should not intentionally pass by a residence/monastery not desiring to enter for the Rains. How this applies to the beginning of the second Rains period is obvious: A bhikkhu must stop for the Rains on that day. As for the beginning of the first Rains period, the Commentary notes simply that if there are obstacles (see below), one may choose to enter the second Rains period instead. One obstacle not mentioned in the list below, however, is discussed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.II.21.4">Mv.II.21.4</a>. This is the case of a monastery where many (i.e., four or more) bhikkhus—“inexperienced and incompetent”—are staying for the Rains and none of them knows the uposatha or the uposatha transaction, the Pāṭimokkha or the recital of the Pāṭimokkha. One of them should be sent to a neighboring monastery immediately to master the Pāṭimokkha in brief or in its full extent. If he can manage it immediately, well and good. If not, one of them should be sent to a neighboring monastery for a period of seven days to master the Pāṭimokkha in brief or in its full extent. If he can manage it within seven days, well and good. If not, then all the bhikkhus should go stay for the Rains in the neighboring monastery. If they stay where they are, they all incur a dukkaṭa. None of the texts discuss the point, but apparently “going to stay for the Rains” in the neighboring monastery means entering the second Rains there.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_003#0186a13">《大品》.三.4.2</a> 规定，在雨安居开始的那一天，不应该故意路过不想入雨安居的住所/寺院。这一条如何适用于后雨安居期的开始是显而易见的：比丘必须在那一天留下来过雨安居。至于前雨安居期的开始，《义注》仅指出，如果有障碍（见下文），可以选择入后雨安居期。然而，有一个障碍在下面的列表中没有提到，在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0158a11">《大品》.二.21.4</a> 中进行了讨论。这种情况发生在一个寺院里，许多（即四位或更多）比丘——「缺乏经验和能力」——留下来过雨安居，他们中没有人懂得布萨或布萨羯磨、《波罗提木叉》或《波罗提木叉》的念诵。应立即派遣其中一人前往邻近的寺院，简略或全面掌握《波罗提木叉》。如果他能立即掌握，那就很好。如果不能，应派遣其中一人前往邻近的寺院，为期七天，简略或全面掌握《波罗提木叉》。如果他能在七天内掌握，那就很好。如果不能，那么所有比丘都应该前往邻近的寺院雨安居。如果他们留在原地，全都犯《突吉罗》。所有文献均未讨论这一点，但显然「前往邻近的寺院雨安居」意味著在那里入后雨安居。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds here that if a monastery has only one bhikkhu who knows the Pāṭimokkha and he dies, leaves, or disrobes in the first month of the first Rains, the remainder should go where there is someone who knows the Pāṭimokkha and stay there for the second Rains. If the knowledgeable bhikkhu dies, leaves, or disrobes in the latter two months of the first Rains, the remainder may stay there for the remainder of the Rains without offense.</td>
<td>《义注》在此补充：如果一座寺院只有一位通晓《波罗提木叉》的比丘，且此人在前雨安居期的第一个月内去世、离开或还俗，其余比丘应前往有通晓《波罗提木叉》之人的地方，并在后雨安居期住在那里。如果这位知识渊博的比丘在前雨安居期的后两个月内去世、离开或还俗，其余比丘可以在雨安居期剩余时间里住在那里而不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>However, one does not have to spend the Rains in a monastery. One may also live alone or in a small, ad hoc group as long as one stays in a proper lodging and knows the uposatha transaction appropriate for one’s number (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#BMC2chapter15">Chapter 15</a>). In general, the Commentary says that a proper lodging is one with a door that can be opened and closed. Improper lodging arrangements listed in the Canon include living in the hollow of a tree (“like goblins”), in the fork of a tree (“like hunters”), in the open air, in a non-lodging (according to the Commentary, this means a place covered with the five kinds of allowable facing/roofing but lacking a door that can be opened and closed), in a charnel house (a place for keeping corpses, says the Commentary, adding that other proper lodgings within a charnel ground are all right), under a canopy, or in a large storage vessel (the Commentary interprets this as a shield). The Commentary notes that if one fixes up a hut in the hollow of a tree or the fork of a tree with a platform, a proper roof, walls, and a door, it is all right to stay there. The same holds true with a canopy or a shield if it is fitted with walls nailed to four posts and provided with a door that can be opened and closed. Yurts would thus be allowable.</td>
<td>然而，不必在寺院里度过雨安居。也可以独自居住，或与临时小群体住在一起，只要住在合适的住所，并通晓适合自己人数的布萨羯磨（见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#BMC2chapter15">第十五章</a>）。一般来说，《义注》说，适当的住所是指有可开关门的住所。《圣典》中列出的不合适的住所包括住在树洞里（「像妖精一样」）、树杈里（「像猎人一样」）、露天、非住所（根据《义注》，这指的是用五种允许的面/屋顶覆盖，但没有可开关门的地方）、尸骨存放处（《义注》说，这是存放尸体的地方，并补充说，尸骨堆内的其他适当住所都可以）、在树冠/顶蓬下，或在一个大型储藏船中（《义注》将其解释为屏障）。《义注》指出，如果在树洞或树杈里搭建了一间小屋，配有平台、合适的屋顶、墙壁和门，那么住在那里是可以的。如果树冠/顶蓬或屏障的墙壁钉在四根柱子上，并配有可开关的门，则同样可以居住。因此，蒙古包是允许的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Canon also gives permission to stay in a cowherd camp, with a caravan, or in a boat. If, during the Rains, any of these picks up and moves, one is allowed to go along. The Commentary adds that if one is planning to stay with a caravan, one should inform the caravan people that one needs a small hut on one of the carts. If they provide that, one may take that hut as one’s residence for the Rains. If not, one may take as one’s residence the space under a tall cart. If that is not possible, one should not enter the Rains with that caravan. If one is joining the caravan in hopes of arriving at a particular destination, then if the caravan reaches that destination one is allowed to remain there even if the caravan continues on its way. If the caravan breaks up, one should remain at the spot where it breaks up until the end of the Rains. If one has entered the Rains in a boat, then if the boat ends its trip, one should stay at that spot. If the boat is following the river bank or sea coast and arrives at one’s destination, one may stay there even if the boat continues its journey.</td>
<td>《圣典》也允许人们在牧牛营、商队或船上居住。如果在雨安居期间，这些中的任何一个开始移动，允许跟随之。《义注》补充道，如果打算跟著商队居住，应该告知商队成员，需要在一辆马车上搭建一间小屋。如果他们提供小屋，可以把小屋当作雨安居的住所。如果没有，可以把高大的马车下方的空间当作住所。如果无法做到这一点，不应该跟随商队入雨安居。如果加入商队是为了到达某个目的地，那么如果商队到达目的地，即使商队继续前行，也可以留在那里。如果商队解散，应该留在解散地点，直到雨安居结束。如果在船上入雨安居，那么如果船结束了行程，应该留在该地点。如果船沿著河岸或海岸行驶并到达自己的目的地，即使船只继续航行，也可以留在那里。</td>

<tr><td>If a bhikkhu has accepted an invitation to stay at a certain place for the Rains but then does not fulfill his promise by not staying at the place, he incurs a dukkaṭa for the broken promise and becomes ineligible for the privileges contingent on having completed that Rains-residence. (Literally, the rule says that his first Rains “isn’t discerned,” which means that it doesn’t count.) The Sub-commentary misses the point of this rule, which has led to its general misinterpretation. In the origin story, Ven. Upananda accepts an invitation to spend the Rains at one spot and then decides to spend the Rains at two other locations. The Sub-commentary maintains that his Rains was invalidated by the fact that he determined two locations for his Rains; however, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.VIII.25.4">Mv.VIII.25.4</a> shows that spending the Rains in two locations, spending half of one’s time at one and half at the other, is perfectly legitimate. Thus the only possible reason for Ven. Upananda’s first Rains not to count is because he broke his promise.</td>
<td>如果一位比丘接受了在某地安居的邀请，但后来却没有履行诺言，没有住在那里，他将因违背诺言而犯《突吉罗》，并且失去资格享受完成雨安居的方便利益。（字面意思是，这条戒条说他的前雨安居「未被辨识」，这意味著它不算数。）《复注》没有理解这条戒条的要点，导致了它被普遍误解。在起源故事中，优波难陀尊者接受了在一个地方雨安居的邀请，然后决定在另外两个地方雨安居。《复注》认为，他的雨安居无效，因为他决意了两个雨安居地点；然而，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0390a10">《大品》.八.25.4</a> 表明，在两个地方雨安居，一半时间在一个地方，一半时间在另一个地方，是完全合法的。因此，优波难陀尊者的前雨安季不算数的唯一可能原因是他违背了诺言。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Canon also states that one also incurs the dukkaṭa for breaking one’s promise in this situation if one goes to the agreed location and then “breaks” one’s Rains (see below). The Commentary notes in either case that if one originally made the promise with the intention of breaking it, one incurs both the dukkaṭa for the broken promise and a pācittiya for lying. From the way these rules are phrased in the Canon—“one’s first (Rains) isn’t discerned”—it would appear that if one promised to stay for the first Rains but then broke the promise, one would still be eligible to stay at the promised place, or elsewhere, for the second Rains and be eligible for the lesser privileges contingent on having completed the second Rains, but none of the commentaries mention this point.</td>
<td>《圣典》也指出，如果去约定地点后「破坏」了雨安居（见下文），在这种情况下，也会因违背诺言而犯《突吉罗》。《义注》指出，无论哪种情况，如果最初许诺时有意违背，他都会因违背诺言而犯《突吉罗》，并因说谎而犯《波逸提》。从《圣典》对这些戒条的表述方式——「无法辨识前（雨安居）」——来看，如果承诺在前雨安居留下，但后来违背了诺言，他仍然有资格在后雨安居留在承诺的地方或其他地方，并有资格在完成后雨安居后享受较少的方便利益，但所有注释书均未提及这一点。</td>

The Canon gives a long list of situations in which a person—lay or ordained—might want a bhikkhu to come for these purposes. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but it provides an interesting glimpse of the merit-making occasions of the time: The donor has arranged the construction of a building, either for the Community, for a group of bhikkhus, or a single bhikkhu; he/she has arranged the construction of a building for his/her own use. Other occasions, given only in the case of a lay follower, include the following: His/her son or daughter is getting married; he/she has fallen ill; or he/she has memorized an important discourse and wants to pass it on so that it does not disappear with his/her death (which, in the days before written transmission, could easily have happened).
