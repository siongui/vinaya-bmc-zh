<tr><td>This training rule is corollary to the preceding one. Other religions at the Buddha’s time observed the formalities of receiving food from their lay followers just as the bhikkhus did, and thus a bhikkhu who gave food in such a way to a mendicant ordained in another religion would be placing himself in the position of a lay follower of that religion, as the second origin story shows. An interesting point about this rule is that the Buddha formulated it at the request of Buddhist lay followers. Having overheard the naked ascetics’ conversation, they said to him, “Venerable sir, these adherents of other religions enjoy criticizing the Buddha… Dhamma… and Saṅgha. It would be good if the masters did not give to adherents of other religions with their own hands.”</td>
<td>这条戒条与前一条戒条相辅相成。在佛陀时代，其他宗教也像比丘一样，遵守著接受他们在家信众食物的礼仪。因此，如果比丘以这种方式向其他宗教的托钵僧给予食物，就等于将自己置于该宗教的在家信众的地位，正如第二个起源故事所示。这条戒条的一个有趣之处在于，佛陀是应佛教在家信众的要求而制定的。他们无意中听到裸行者的谈话，便对佛陀说：「世尊，这些外教信徒喜欢批评佛……法……僧。如果大德们不亲手将食物给予外教信徒就好了。」</td>

Because “going forth” was how ordination was understood at that time, we can use the Great Standards at present to include anyone ordained in other religions—e.g., Catholic priests, Protestant ministers, Jewish rabbis, Muslim mullahs, etc.—under the factor of object here as well. Different Communities differ as to whether they would include people ordained in other Buddhist religions—such as Zen priests or Tibetan lamas—under this category as well.</td>

In other words, a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. An unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. <em>This pattern—three pācittiyas and three dukkaṭas—is repeated in all the rules where a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya, an unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa, and perception is not a mitigating factor.</em></td>

<tr><td>The origin story here, briefly, is this: Ven. Upananda visits a woman in her private quarters. Her husband approaches him respectfully, has his wife give him alms, and then asks him to leave. The wife senses that her husband wants to have sexual intercourse with her and so—as a game, apparently—keeps detaining Ven. Upananda until the husband gets exasperated and goes to complain to the bhikkhus: “Venerable sirs, this master Upananda is sitting in the bedroom with my wife. I have dismissed him, but he isn’t willing to go. We are very busy and have much work to do.”</td>

<tr><td>A family “with its meal.” This term—<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>—appears to be a pun in the original Pali, meaning either “with its meal”—<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>—or “with two people”—<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>. The Vibhaṅga explains it as a euphemism meaning “a man and woman together, both not having gone out (of their bedroom), not both without lust.” As its further explanations show, this means a man and woman together in their private quarters, with at least one of them desiring sexual intercourse with the other. Although the Commentary tries to justify the Vibhaṅga’s explanation etymologically (<em>bhoga</em>, the root form of meal, has other forms meaning enjoyment, indulgence, and use), there is no need to turn to etymology. Since ancient times in all cultures, eating has been commonly used as a metaphor for sex. (Similarly, the husband’s comment that he “has much work to do” could also be taken as a double entendre.)</td>
<td>一个家庭「与其餐食」。「<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>」一词在原本巴利语中似乎是双关语，意为「与其餐食」——<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>——或「与两个人」——<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>。《经分别》将其解释为一种委婉说法，意为「一男一女在一起，两人均未出（他们的卧室），并非双方都无情欲」。进一步的解释表明，这意味著一男一女在私人住处，至少其中一人渴望与另一人发生性关系。尽管《义注》试图从字源学角度论证《经分别》的解释（<em>bhoga</em>，餐食的字根，还有其他形式，意为享受、放纵和使用），但无需追溯词源。自古以来，在所有文化中，「吃」就普遍被用作性的隐喻。（同样，丈夫说他「有很多工作要做」也可以理解为（含情欲的）双关语。）</td>

<tr><td>To <em>sit intruding</em> means to sit—without another bhikkhu present—in the private area of the house, this being defined in terms of how large the house is. In one large enough to have a separate bedroom, the private area is any spot more than one hatthapāsa (1.25 meters) in from the doorway (of the bedroom, says the Commentary). In a smaller house, the private area is the back half of the house. None of the texts discuss such things as one-room apartments or hotel rooms, but these would probably be treated as “separate bedrooms.”</td>
<td><em>坐著并打扰</em>是指在没有其他比丘在场的情况下，坐在房屋的私人区域内。私人区域的定义取决于房屋的大小。在一间大到可以设有独立卧室的房屋中，私人区域是指距离（《义注》中说是卧室的）门口超过一个 hatthapāsa （1.25米）的任何位置。在较小的房屋中，私人区域是指房屋的后半部。所有文献均未讨论单房间公寓或饭店房间之类的情况，但这些可能被视为「独立卧室」。</td>

<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha provides a third interpretation, defining “not aiming at privacy” with the following illustration: A bhikkhu is sitting in a secluded place with a man and woman present, but the man gets up and leaves before the bhikkhu can stop him. In other words, the bhikkhu is not intending to sit alone in private with the woman at all, but circumstances beyond his control force him to.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》提供了第三种解释，用以下例子来定义「不为了隐私」：一位比丘与一男一女坐在僻静之处，但比丘还没来得及阻止，那位男士就起身离开了。换句话说，比丘根本并不想与那位女士单独坐在一起，但他无法控制的情况迫使他不得不如此。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the first interpretation, because it adheres most closely to the wording in the Vibhaṅga, is probably the correct one here, the Vinaya-mukha’s is probably the safest, and many Communities adhere to it with good reason. Both the Canon and the Commentary give frequent warnings about the dangers that can arise when a bhikkhu sits alone with a woman even when his original intention is innocent. His own defilements may eventually tempt him to do, say, or think things that are detrimental to his resolve in the celibate life; and even when his motives are pure, he is inviting the suspicions of others. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a> requires that if a trustworthy outside witness is suspicious of a bhikkhu’s sitting alone with a woman—and unless he is sitting with his mother or other elderly relative, it’s rare that outsiders won’t be suspicious—the Community must meet to investigate the issue. Even though they may find him innocent of any wrong doing, the fact that they have had to investigate his behavior is usually enough to keep suspicions alive among the laity and to create resentment among his fellow bhikkhus over the waste of their time due to his indiscretion. At the same time, a bhikkhu sitting alone with a woman is leaving himself at the mercy of the woman, who will later be free to make any claims she likes about what went on while they were alone together. As Lady Visākhā said in the origin story to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a>, “It is unfitting and improper, venerable sir, for the master to sit in private, alone with a woman…. Even though the master may not be aiming at that act, cynical people are hard to convince.”</td>
<td>虽然第一种解释，因为它与《经分别》的措辞最为接近，在此可能是正确的，但《戒律入口》的解释可能是最安全的，许多僧团也有充分的理由遵循它。《圣典》和《义注》都多次警告比丘，即使他的初衷是无辜的，与女人独坐也会产生危险。他自身的烦恼最终可能会诱使他做出、说出或思考一些有损于他梵行生活决心的事情；即使他的动机是纯洁的，他也会引起他人的怀疑。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>规定，如果一个值得信赖的外部目击者怀疑比丘与女人独坐——除非他与母亲或其他年长的亲戚坐在一起，否则外人很少不会起疑心——僧团必须开会调查此事。即使他们可能认定他无辜没有做错，但必须调查他的行为本身这件事实通常足以在俗人中引起怀疑，并激起他的比丘同侪们的不满，因为他的轻率行为浪费了他们的时间。同时，比丘与女子独坐，等于任由女子摆布，而女子日后可以随意对他们独处时发生的事情做出任何她想要的声称。正如毘舍佉鹿子母在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>的起源故事时所说：「大德，大师与女子独坐，是不得体且不恰当的……即使大师并非有意为之，愤世嫉俗的人也很难被说服。」</td>
</tr>

<td>因此，明智之举是在解释这一因素时，其严格程度不低于其所在僧团的严格程度。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Non-offenses</strong></td>
<td><strong>不犯</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition to the bhikkhu not aiming at privacy, there is no offense for the bhikkhu who sits alone with a woman when his attention is elsewhere—e.g., he is absorbed in his work or his meditation when a woman comes in and sits down in the room where he is sitting. Also, there is no offense if either the bhikkhu or the woman or both are standing, or if both are sitting when a knowledgeable man is present.</td>
<td>除了比丘不为了隐私之外，如果比丘与女子独坐时注意力在别处，例如，他正专心工作或禅修，有位女子走进他所坐的房间里坐下，这并无犯戒。此外，如果比丘或女子，或两人都站著，或者两人都坐著，而且有一位博学的男士在场，这同样也无犯戒。</td>

<td>至于如何判断是否有比丘在或不在，《义注》是这样区分的：当心生走访俗家的愿望，并沿著正常的路径离开寺院后，如果遇到一位距离足够近、可以用正常语气讲话的比丘（《复注》中说，距离在六米以内），则代表有比丘在，应告知其去向。如果在这么近的地方没有遇到比丘，则表示没有比丘在，无需特意去找。</td>

<tr><td>This, though, is in direct contradiction to the Vibhaṅga’s definition of available—“It is possible to go, having taken leave”—that is, if there is another bhikkhu in the monastery, and there are no obstacles to taking one’s leave from him (e.g., he is asleep, he is sick, he is receiving important visitors), one is obliged to go out of one’s way to inform him.</td>
<td>但这与《经分别》中「在」的定义直接矛盾——「告别后可以离开」——也就是说，如果寺院里有另一位比丘，而向他告别没有任何障碍（例如，他睡著了，他生病了，他正在接待重要访客），那么就有义务去通知他。</td>

<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, <em>taking leave</em> in the context of this rule means the simple act of informing the other bhikkhu that, “I am going to the house of so-and-so,” or any similar statement. In other words, one is not asking permission to go (see the discussion of <em>taking leave</em> under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc14">Pc 14</a>). However, if the other bhikkhu sees that one is doing something improper in going, he is perfectly free to say so. If one treats his comments with disrespect, one incurs at least a dukkaṭa under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc54">Pc 54</a>. (See the discussion under that rule for details.)</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，在此戒条中，「<em>告别</em>」指的是简单地告知其他比丘「我要去某某家」或任何类似的说法。换句话说，并非在请求允许前往（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0017/#Pc14">《波逸提》十四</a>中<em>告别</em>的讨论）。然而，如果其他比丘认为前往时在做不恰当的事情，他完全可以自由地如此说。如果不尊重其他比丘的言辞，则根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc54">《波逸提》五四</a>，至少会犯《突吉罗》。（详情请参阅该戒条下的讨论。）</td>

<tr><td>For a new bhikkhu still living in dependence <em>(nissaya)</em> on his mentor, though, taking leave <em>is</em> a matter of asking permission at all times, whether one has been invited to a meal or not. The Mahāvagga (I.25.24; II.21.1) states that one of the duties of such a bhikkhu is that he must receive permission from his mentor before entering a village, going to a cemetery, or leaving the district. Not to ask permission before going, or to go after being denied permission, is to incur a dukkaṭa. As for the mentor, if he gives permission to go when it is not appropriate to do so, <em>he</em> is the one who incurs the dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>然而，对于仍依止<em>（nissaya）</em>导师生活的新出家比丘来说，无论是否受邀请赴餐食，每次离开<em>都</em>需先行请求导师的允许。《大品》（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_001/#0067a04">一.25.24</a>；<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_002/#0157a10">二.21.1</a>）规定，这类比丘的义务之一是，在进入村庄、前往墓地或离开所在地区之前，必须获得导师的许可。未经许可前往，或被拒绝后仍前往，均会犯《突吉罗》。至于导师，如果在不合适的情况下允许前往，<em>他</em>自己犯《突吉罗》。</td>

<tr><td>Perception as to whether one has actually been invited to a meal is not a mitigating factor here (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</td>
<td>对于是否真的被邀请赴餐食的感知并不是这里的减轻惩罚的因素（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0016/#Pc4">《波逸提》四</a>）。</td>
