<tr><td>This training rule is corollary to the preceding one. Other religions at the Buddha’s time observed the formalities of receiving food from their lay followers just as the bhikkhus did, and thus a bhikkhu who gave food in such a way to a mendicant ordained in another religion would be placing himself in the position of a lay follower of that religion, as the second origin story shows. An interesting point about this rule is that the Buddha formulated it at the request of Buddhist lay followers. Having overheard the naked ascetics’ conversation, they said to him, “Venerable sir, these adherents of other religions enjoy criticizing the Buddha… Dhamma… and Saṅgha. It would be good if the masters did not give to adherents of other religions with their own hands.”</td>
<td>这条戒条与前一条戒条相辅相成。在佛陀时代，其他宗教也像比丘一样，遵守著接受他们在家信众食物的礼仪。因此，如果比丘以这种方式向其他宗教的托钵僧给予食物，就等于将自己置于该宗教的在家信众的地位，正如第二个起源故事所示。这条戒条的一个有趣之处在于，佛陀是应佛教在家信众的要求而制定的。他们无意中听到裸行者的谈话，便对佛陀说：「世尊，这些外教信徒喜欢批评佛……法……僧。如果大德们不亲手将食物给予外教信徒就好了。」</td>

Because “going forth” was how ordination was understood at that time, we can use the Great Standards at present to include anyone ordained in other religions—e.g., Catholic priests, Protestant ministers, Jewish rabbis, Muslim mullahs, etc.—under the factor of object here as well. Different Communities differ as to whether they would include people ordained in other Buddhist religions—such as Zen priests or Tibetan lamas—under this category as well.</td>

In other words, a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. An unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. <em>This pattern—three pācittiyas and three dukkaṭas—is repeated in all the rules where a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya, an unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa, and perception is not a mitigating factor.</em></td>

<tr><td>The origin story here, briefly, is this: Ven. Upananda visits a woman in her private quarters. Her husband approaches him respectfully, has his wife give him alms, and then asks him to leave. The wife senses that her husband wants to have sexual intercourse with her and so—as a game, apparently—keeps detaining Ven. Upananda until the husband gets exasperated and goes to complain to the bhikkhus: “Venerable sirs, this master Upananda is sitting in the bedroom with my wife. I have dismissed him, but he isn’t willing to go. We are very busy and have much work to do.”</td>

<tr><td>A family “with its meal.” This term—<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>—appears to be a pun in the original Pali, meaning either “with its meal”—<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>—or “with two people”—<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>. The Vibhaṅga explains it as a euphemism meaning “a man and woman together, both not having gone out (of their bedroom), not both without lust.” As its further explanations show, this means a man and woman together in their private quarters, with at least one of them desiring sexual intercourse with the other. Although the Commentary tries to justify the Vibhaṅga’s explanation etymologically (<em>bhoga</em>, the root form of meal, has other forms meaning enjoyment, indulgence, and use), there is no need to turn to etymology. Since ancient times in all cultures, eating has been commonly used as a metaphor for sex. (Similarly, the husband’s comment that he “has much work to do” could also be taken as a double entendre.)</td>
<td>一个家庭「与其餐食」。「<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>」一词在原本巴利语中似乎是双关语，意为「与其餐食」——<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>——或「与两个人」——<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>。《经分别》将其解释为一种委婉说法，意为「一男一女在一起，两人均未出（他们的卧室），并非双方都无情欲」。进一步的解释表明，这意味著一男一女在私人住处，至少其中一人渴望与另一人发生性关系。尽管《义注》试图从字源学角度论证《经分别》的解释（<em>bhoga</em>，餐食的字根，还有其他形式，意为享受、放纵和使用），但无需追溯词源。自古以来，在所有文化中，「吃」就普遍被用作性的隐喻。（同样，丈夫说他「有很多工作要做」也可以理解为（含情欲的）双关语。）</td>

<tr><td>To <em>sit intruding</em> means to sit—without another bhikkhu present—in the private area of the house, this being defined in terms of how large the house is. In one large enough to have a separate bedroom, the private area is any spot more than one hatthapāsa (1.25 meters) in from the doorway (of the bedroom, says the Commentary). In a smaller house, the private area is the back half of the house. None of the texts discuss such things as one-room apartments or hotel rooms, but these would probably be treated as “separate bedrooms.”</td>
<td><em>坐著并打扰</em>是指在没有其他比丘在场的情况下，坐在房屋的私人区域内。私人区域的定义取决于房屋的大小。在一间大到可以设有独立卧室的房屋中，私人区域是指距离（《义注》中说是卧室的）门口超过一个 hatthapāsa （1.25米）的任何位置。在较小的房屋中，私人区域是指房屋的后半部。所有文献均未讨论单房间公寓或饭店房间之类的情况，但这些可能被视为「独立卧室」。</td>

<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha provides a third interpretation, defining “not aiming at privacy” with the following illustration: A bhikkhu is sitting in a secluded place with a man and woman present, but the man gets up and leaves before the bhikkhu can stop him. In other words, the bhikkhu is not intending to sit alone in private with the woman at all, but circumstances beyond his control force him to.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》提供了第三种解释，用以下例子来定义「不为了隐私」：一位比丘与一男一女坐在僻静之处，但比丘还没来得及阻止，那位男士就起身离开了。换句话说，比丘根本并不想与那位女士单独坐在一起，但他无法控制的情况迫使他不得不如此。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the first interpretation, because it adheres most closely to the wording in the Vibhaṅga, is probably the correct one here, the Vinaya-mukha’s is probably the safest, and many Communities adhere to it with good reason. Both the Canon and the Commentary give frequent warnings about the dangers that can arise when a bhikkhu sits alone with a woman even when his original intention is innocent. His own defilements may eventually tempt him to do, say, or think things that are detrimental to his resolve in the celibate life; and even when his motives are pure, he is inviting the suspicions of others. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a> requires that if a trustworthy outside witness is suspicious of a bhikkhu’s sitting alone with a woman—and unless he is sitting with his mother or other elderly relative, it’s rare that outsiders won’t be suspicious—the Community must meet to investigate the issue. Even though they may find him innocent of any wrong doing, the fact that they have had to investigate his behavior is usually enough to keep suspicions alive among the laity and to create resentment among his fellow bhikkhus over the waste of their time due to his indiscretion. At the same time, a bhikkhu sitting alone with a woman is leaving himself at the mercy of the woman, who will later be free to make any claims she likes about what went on while they were alone together. As Lady Visākhā said in the origin story to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a>, “It is unfitting and improper, venerable sir, for the master to sit in private, alone with a woman…. Even though the master may not be aiming at that act, cynical people are hard to convince.”</td>
<td>虽然第一种解释，因为它与《经分别》的措辞最为接近，在此可能是正确的，但《戒律入口》的解释可能是最安全的，许多僧团也有充分的理由遵循它。《圣典》和《义注》都多次警告比丘，即使他的初衷是无辜的，与女人独坐也会产生危险。他自身的烦恼最终可能会诱使他做出、说出或思考一些有损于他梵行生活决心的事情；即使他的动机是纯洁的，他也会引起他人的怀疑。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>规定，如果一个值得信赖的外部目击者怀疑比丘与女人独坐——除非他与母亲或其他年长的亲戚坐在一起，否则外人很少不会起疑心——僧团必须开会调查此事。即使他们可能认定他无辜没有做错，但必须调查他的行为本身这件事实通常足以在俗人中引起怀疑，并激起他的比丘同侪们的不满，因为他的轻率行为浪费了他们的时间。同时，比丘与女子独坐，等于任由女子摆布，而女子日后可以随意对他们独处时发生的事情做出任何她想要的声称。正如毘舍佉鹿子母在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>的起源故事时所说：「大德，大师与女子独坐，是不得体且不恰当的……即使大师并非有意为之，愤世嫉俗的人也很难被说服。」</td>
</tr>

<td>因此，明智之举是在解释这一因素时，其严格程度不低于其所在僧团的严格程度。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Non-offenses</strong></td>
<td><strong>不犯</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition to the bhikkhu not aiming at privacy, there is no offense for the bhikkhu who sits alone with a woman when his attention is elsewhere—e.g., he is absorbed in his work or his meditation when a woman comes in and sits down in the room where he is sitting. Also, there is no offense if either the bhikkhu or the woman or both are standing, or if both are sitting when a knowledgeable man is present.</td>
<td>除了比丘不为了隐私之外，如果比丘与女子独坐时注意力在别处，例如，他正专心工作或禅修，有位女子走进他所坐的房间里坐下，这并无犯戒。此外，如果比丘或女子，或两人都站著，或者两人都坐著，而且有一位博学的男士在场，这同样也无犯戒。</td>

<td>至于如何判断是否有比丘在或不在，《义注》是这样区分的：当心生走访俗家的愿望，并沿著正常的路径离开寺院后，如果遇到一位距离足够近、可以用正常语气讲话的比丘（《复注》中说，距离在六米以内），则代表有比丘在，应告知其去向。如果在这么近的地方没有遇到比丘，则表示没有比丘在，无需特意去找。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This, though, is in direct contradiction to the Vibhaṅga’s definition of available—“It is possible to go, having taken leave”—that is, if there is another bhikkhu in the monastery, and there are no obstacles to taking one’s leave from him (e.g., he is asleep, he is sick, he is receiving important visitors), one is obliged to go out of one’s way to inform him.</td>
<td>但这与《经分别》中「在」的定义直接矛盾——「告别后可以离开」——也就是说，如果寺院里有另一位比丘，而向他告别没有任何障碍（例如，他睡著了，他生病了，他正在接待重要访客），那么就有义务去通知他。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, <em>taking leave</em> in the context of this rule means the simple act of informing the other bhikkhu that, “I am going to the house of so-and-so,” or any similar statement. In other words, one is not asking permission to go (see the discussion of <em>taking leave</em> under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc14">Pc 14</a>). However, if the other bhikkhu sees that one is doing something improper in going, he is perfectly free to say so. If one treats his comments with disrespect, one incurs at least a dukkaṭa under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc54">Pc 54</a>. (See the discussion under that rule for details.)</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，在此戒条中，「<em>告别</em>」指的是简单地告知其他比丘「我要去某某家」或任何类似的说法。换句话说，并非在请求允许前往（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0017/#Pc14">《波逸提》十四</a>中<em>告别</em>的讨论）。然而，如果其他比丘认为前往时在做不恰当的事情，他完全可以自由地如此说。如果不尊重其他比丘的言辞，则根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc54">《波逸提》五四</a>，至少会犯《突吉罗》。（详情请参阅该戒条下的讨论。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>For a new bhikkhu still living in dependence <em>(nissaya)</em> on his mentor, though, taking leave <em>is</em> a matter of asking permission at all times, whether one has been invited to a meal or not. The Mahāvagga (I.25.24; II.21.1) states that one of the duties of such a bhikkhu is that he must receive permission from his mentor before entering a village, going to a cemetery, or leaving the district. Not to ask permission before going, or to go after being denied permission, is to incur a dukkaṭa. As for the mentor, if he gives permission to go when it is not appropriate to do so, <em>he</em> is the one who incurs the dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>然而，对于仍依止<em>（nissaya）</em>导师生活的新出家比丘来说，无论是否受邀请赴餐食，每次离开<em>都</em>需先行请求导师的允许。《大品》（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_001/#0067a04">一.25.24</a>；<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_002/#0157a10">二.21.1</a>）规定，这类比丘的义务之一是，在进入村庄、前往墓地或离开所在地区之前，必须获得导师的许可。未经许可前往，或被拒绝后仍前往，均会犯《突吉罗》。至于导师，如果在不合适的情况下允许前往，<em>他</em>自己犯《突吉罗》。</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in conjunction with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">Pc 85</a>, is designed to keep bhikkhus from visiting lay people and spending their time in inappropriate ways. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">Pc 85</a> deals with entire villages and towns, and covers the act of leaving the monastery during the period from noon until the following dawnrise. This rule deals with family residences and covers the act of leaving the monastery during the period from dawnrise until noon on days when one has been invited to a meal. The period from dawnrise to noon on days when one is not invited to a meal, and would be expected to go on alms round, is thus not covered by either rule. Note, however, that in the origin story to this rule the Buddha reprimands Ven. Upananda for visiting families during the latter part of a morning after going for alms. This shows that he did not approve of such behavior even though he had practical reasons for not laying down a rule against it: On mornings when one is going for alms—and in his time, alms-going could often be an all-morning affair—there is no convenient way to draw a hard and fast line between appropriate alms-going and inappropriate visiting. Thus we have the rules as they stand. At present, though, in monasteries where alms-going takes up much less of the morning or where the bhikkhus do not go outside the monastery for alms at all, a wise policy is to adhere to the general principle by informing a fellow bhikkhu whenever possible when one is leaving the monastery for errands or visits involving lay people, even during periods not covered by the rules.</td>
<td>这条戒条，结合<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">《波逸提》八五</a>，旨在防止比丘拜访俗人并以不适当的方式度过他们的时间。<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">《波逸提》八五</a>涉及整个村庄和城镇，并涵盖从中午到第二天黎明之前的时间段离开寺院的行为。这条戒条涉及俗家住处，涵盖在被邀请赴餐食的日子里从黎明到中午的时间段离开寺院的行为。因此，在没有被邀请赴餐食而应该去托钵的日子里，从黎明到中午的时间段不在这两条戒条的范围内。但请注意，在本戒条的起源故事中，佛陀斥责了优跋难陀尊者，因为他在托钵后于上午的后半段拜访俗家。这表明他不赞成这种行为，尽管他有不制定禁止戒条的实际原因：在去托钵的上午——在他的时代，托钵往往是一整个上午的事情——没有方便的方法来在适当的托钵和不适当的拜访之间划出一条严格的界限。因此，我们有了现在的戒条。然而，目前，在托钵占用早上时间很少或比丘根本不出寺院托钵的寺院中，一个明智之举是遵守一般原则，尽可能在离开寺院办事或牵涉俗人的拜访时通知同侪比丘，即使是在戒条未涵盖的时间段。</td>

Although the Vibhaṅga makes no specific mention of this point, the Commentary’s explanation seems the best way to make sense of this non-offense clause and the relationship between this rule and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc39">Pc 39</a>. Under that rule, a bhikkhu who is not ill and has not been invited incurs a dukkaṭa in asking for any one of the five tonics, and there seems no reason to impose a heavier penalty for requesting one of the five tonics after a personal invitation to do so has expired. If, though, the invitation referred to in this rule is one made to an entire Community, the heavier penalty makes sense as an added protection to the donor against having his/her invitation abused by the less conscientious members of the Community. This added protection would also be a means of encouraging further invitations of this sort in the future.</td>
<td>需要解释的两条不犯条款之一是，「向邀请自己药物的人」要求并无犯戒。《义注》对此的解释是，如果收到了个人邀请，则可以按照其条款提出要求，但除此之外，此戒条的限制仅适用于向整个僧团发出的邀请，而不适用于基于个人向个别比丘发出的邀请。虽然《经分别》没有具体提及这一点，但《义注》的解释似乎是理解此不犯条款以及此戒条与<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0019/#Pc39">《波逸提》三九</a>之间关系的最佳方式。根据该戒条，无病且未被邀请的比丘在要求五种补品中的任何一种时犯《突吉罗》，并且似乎没有理由对在个人邀请过期后请求五种补品之一施加更重的惩罚。然而，如果本戒条中提到的邀请是向整个僧团发出的，那么更重的惩罚是合理的，因为它可以为布施者提供额外的保护，防止其邀请被僧团中不太负责任的成员滥用。这种额外的保护也有助于鼓励未来继续进行此类邀请。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The second non-offense clause requiring explanation is the one for an ill bhikkhu. Reading the rule, one might imagine that the exemption for an ill bhikkhu would read simply, “There is no offense if one is ill,” but instead it reads, “There is no offense if one says, ‘The time period for which we were invited has passed, but we have need of medicine.’” This is an important point of etiquette. Normally, an ill bhikkhu may ask anyone for medicine at any time, but in dealing with a person who has made an invitation for medicine to the Community, he has to show special consideration. In mentioning the fact that the time period for the invitation has expired, he gives recognition of the fact that the donor is no longer under any obligation to provide the medicine, thus giving the donor a convenient “out” in case he/she can no longer provide it. This simple gesture is the least consideration that can be shown to someone who has had the generosity to invite the Community to ask for medicines. And again, simple gestures of this sort help to protect donors and encourage similar invitations again in the future.</td>
<td>第二个需要解释的不犯条款是关于生病比丘的。阅读这条戒条，可能会以为，对生病比丘的豁免条款可简单地拼读成「如果生病，就没有犯戒」，但实际上却是「如果说『我们被邀请的期限已过，但我们需要药物』，则没有犯戒。」这是威仪中的一个重要方面。通常，生病的比丘可以随时向任何人要求药物，但在对待邀请僧团索取药物的人时，他必须表现出特殊的体谅。在提到邀请期限已过这一事实时，他承认了布施者不再有提供药物的义务，从而为布施者在无法再提供药物时提供了一个方便的「借口」。这个简单的举动，是对慷慨邀请僧团索取药物的人所能表现出的最低限度的体谅。再次强调，这种简单的举动有助于保护布施者，并鼓励未来再次发出类似的邀请。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although this last non-offense clause applies explicitly only to an invitation specifying the time period, the Great Standards could be used to apply it to an invitation specifying requisites as well. In other words, an ill bhikkhu could say, “You invited the Community with honey, but I have need of ghee.”</td>
<td>虽然最后这条不犯条款明确仅适用于指定时段的邀请，但可用《四大教示》来将此不犯条款也适用于指定必需品的邀请。换句话说，一位生病的比丘可以说：「你用蜂蜜邀请僧团，但我需要酥油。」</td>

<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha tries to extend this rule to cover invitations of every sort, individual and communal, dealing with any sort of requisite. It also reads the training rule to mean that if a time limit is not specified on an invitation, a four-month time limit is to be assumed. All of this has no support in the Vibhaṅga and so is not binding, but the last point is something that individual bhikkhus may adopt as a personal policy to teach themselves moderation in their requests. A donor’s faith and financial position can change quickly, and it is reasonable not to depend on an invitation for longer periods of time unless the donor makes it clear that he/she is still willing to continue providing the item offered on a long-term basis.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》试图将此戒条扩展至涵盖各种形式的邀请，无论是个人邀请还是集体邀请，以及处理任何种类的必需品。它还将本戒条解读成，如果邀请未注明期限，则视为四个月的期限。所有这些在《经分别》中均无依据，因此不具有约束力，但最后一点是比丘们可以作为个人准则，以学习在请求时保持节制。布施者的信心和经济状况可以快速地转变，因此，除非布施者明确表示愿意长期继续供养物品，否则不依赖长期邀请是合理的。</td>

<tr><td>Armies in the Buddha’s time consisted mainly of what we would call reserve units. These were organized into four divisions: elephant units, cavalry units, chariot units, and infantry units. The soldiers for the most part were citizens who would live at home until called up on active duty to engage in actual warfare or to practice maneuvers, activities that normally took place outside the city. Battles, both actual and practice, were fought according to rules—total warfare did not come to India until many centuries after the Buddha’s time—and it was possible for non-military citizens to watch, with occasional danger to life and limb, much as people at present watch football games. (Going to a battlefield is listed in the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN 1) as a form of entertainment.)</td>
<td>佛陀时代的军队主要由我们所谓的预备队组成。这些预备队分为四个部分：象队、骑兵队、战车队和步兵队。士兵大多为平民，他们在家居住，直至被征召入伍值勤，参与实际战争或演习，这些活动通常在城外进行。无论是实际战斗还是演习，都遵循规则——总体战争直到佛陀时代之后数个世纪才传入印度——非军人公民也可以观看，尽管偶尔会有生命危险，就像现在人们观看足球比赛一样。（《梵网经》（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/chang/content/01.html">《长部》1经</a>）将前往战场列为一种娱乐形式。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>With this information in mind, it is easy to understand the Vibhaṅga’s treatment of this rule: An army on active duty—composed of a full panoply of elephant, cavalry, chariot, and infantry units who have left the city—is grounds for a pācittiya. This applies whether the army is camped or on the move. Any segment of an army on duty—even one armed archer, says the Commentary—is grounds for a dukkaṭa. An army not on duty—the Commentary illustrates this with a king’s pleasure trip—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>了解了这些资讯，就容易理解《经分别》对这条戒条的处理方式：一支正在值勤的军队——由全副武装的战象、骑兵、战车和步兵组成，并且已经离开城市——构成《波逸提》。无论军队是驻扎还是行进，这条都适用。《义注》指出，任何值勤的军队——即使只有一个武装弓箭手——构成《突吉罗》。一支未值勤的军队——《义注》以国王的游乐旅行为例——不构成犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>To apply these definitions to armed forces at present: The Vibhaṅga’s definition for army comes close to the modern definition of a field army with a full array of artillery, armored, airborne, and infantry divisions. Navies, marines, and air forces did not exist at that time, but the Great Standards would allow us to extend the definition of <em>army</em> to cover similar large units of these branches of the military as well. Because armies on active duty no longer limit their activities to areas outside of cities—they are sometimes based in cities, run practice drills there, and can be called in to quell riots or fight enemy forces there—the definition of “on active duty” must be changed to fit the way armies use it at present. Thus soldiers at work on base or off would count as being on duty. An army camped—on base or off—for active duty would also count as being on active duty. There is some controversy at present as to whether the on-base areas for staff housing would count as an army camped, but because the Vibhaṅga defines <em>active duty</em> as being away from home, it would seem that the homes within a base would not come under this rule.</td>
<td>将这些定义应用于当今的武装部队：《经分别》对军队的定义接近现代野战军的定义，该野战军拥有完整的砲兵、装甲师、空降师和步兵师。当时还没有海军、海军陆战队和空军，但《四大教示》允许我们扩展<em>军队</em>的定义，使其涵盖这些军种的类似大型部队。由于值勤军队的活动范围不再局限于城市以外的地区——他们有时驻扎在城市，在那里进行训练演习，并可能被召集到城市平息骚乱或与敌军作战——「值勤」的定义必须进行修改，以适应军队目前的使用方式。因此，在基地或基地外工作的士兵都算在值勤。在基地或基地外驻扎服现役的军队也算是在值勤。目前，对于基地内的工作人员住房是否算作驻扎的军队目前存在一些争议，但由于《经分别》将<em>值勤</em>定义为离家在外，因此基地内的住家似乎不受此戒条的约束。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>With these points in mind, we may say that a full field army—or the equivalent in naval, marine, or air forces—on active duty would be grounds for a pācittiya here. Any smaller unit of the military on active duty—a regiment, a division, or even one armed soldier—would be grounds for a dukkaṭa. Armies not on active duty, as when they organize charity events, would not be grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>考虑到以上几点，我们可以说，一支完整的野战军——或相当于海军、陆战队或空军的部队——在值勤，此处构成《波逸提》。任何较小的值勤军人单位——一个团、一个师，甚至一名武装士兵——构成《突吉罗》。非值勤军队，例如在组织慈善活动时，则不构成犯戒。</td>
