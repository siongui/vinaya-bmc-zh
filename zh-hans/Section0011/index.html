<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>这个术语的意思是「让僧团参与初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和后续 <em>(sesa)</em> 行为」。它源于这样一个事实，即僧团是最初要求违反此类戒条的比丘接受惩罚（ <em>mānatta</em> ，赎罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，别住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他没有正确执行，则随后重新施加惩罚，最终当他正确执行后解除惩罚。此处有十三个学处（训练戒条），前九个在违反时即犯《僧残》，最后四个只有在违反者作为僧伽羯磨的一部分被诃责三次之后才犯《僧残》。</td>

<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">尔时，施越尊者过著不满的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形体枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脉悉现。优陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。一见到他，就对他说：『友！施越！，你为什么形体枯瘦…筋脉悉现？难道你对梵行生活不满意？』</td>

Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「于是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……当不满生起，欲念侵袭心时，他就会用手攻击射出精液。然后没多久，他就变得很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。因此，他的朋友比丘们对他说：『以前，朋友施越，你形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。但现在的你很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。难道是你在吃药？』</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒条的大纲形式是最容易解释的戒条之一。然而，就其细节而言，它是最复杂的之一，不仅因为该主题是一个敏感问题，而且因为《义注》在对构成完整违犯的三个因素中的两个的解释中偏离了《经分别》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>这三个因素是结果、意图和努力：由于有意的努力而导致精液的排出。当这三个因素都存在时，该违犯就是《僧残》。如果最后两项——意图和努力——都存在，那么该违犯就是《偷兰遮》。任何单一因素或两个因素的任何其他组合——即没有做出肉体的努力的意图和结果，或没有意图的努力和结果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出结果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解释一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒条所涵盖的意图和努力类型时，有必要知道它们的目的是什么，也因为结果是《经分别》和《义注》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<td><strong>结果</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，精液有十种颜色，这种分类源自古印度医学的诊断实践，医生会检查男性患者的射精，以此作为诊断其健康状况的一种方式。在根据这十种颜色的精液提出了一长系列的轮子之后，《经分别》得出了一个简单的结论：精液的颜色和品质与犯戒无关。这表明，接受过输精管结扎手术的比丘仍然可以犯下这条戒条，因为他仍然可以在性高潮时排出进入精液的各种成分（仅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>尽管《经分别》补充说，当精液「从基底落下」时，精液就会被排出，但它并没有详细讨论这一点。关于这种情况在性刺激过程中何时发生，《义注》讨论了三种观点。尽管它的讨论是以当时所理解的射精生理学为框架的，但它的结论很明确：当「使整个身体摇晃时，它被释放并下降到尿道」时，精液从其基底移动—换句话说，在性高潮的时候。《义注》进一步解释说，精液在进入尿道时会从其基底落下，因为从那时起，该过程是不可逆转的。因此，如果性刺激的过程达到了这一点，即使在性高潮时试图透过捏住阴茎末端来阻止精液离开身体，结果因素也已经满足。一旦进入尿道，它就已经从基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否离开身体并不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>尽管一些《复注》的再注释提出了比《义注》更谨慎的观点，即当射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺产生少量透明碱性液体时，精液就被视为从其基底落下。《经分别》中没有任何内容可以证明《义注》是错误的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Intention</strong></td>
<td><strong>意图</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” The Commentary explains these terms as follows: <em>Having willed</em> means having willed, having planned, with the intention of enjoying bringing about an emission. <em>Having made the decision</em> means having summoned up a reckless mind state, “crushing” through the power of an attack. (These are the same terms it uses to explain the same phrase under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">Pc 61</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">Pc 77</a>. The meaning is that one is not simply toying with the idea. One has definitely made up one’s mind to overcome all hesitation by aggressively setting upon an action aimed at causing emission.) <em>Knowingly</em> means knowing that, “I am making an exertion”—which the Sub-commentary explains as knowing that, “I am making an exertion for the sake of an emission.” <em>Consciously</em> means being aware that one’s efforts are bringing about an emission of semen.</td>
<td>《经分别》将<em>故意</em>定义为「有意愿，明知地而且有意识地做出决定」。《义注》对这些术语的解释如下：<em>有意愿</em>，意思是已经愿意、已经计划、并且意图享受射精。<em>做出决定</em>，意思是唤起了不顾后果的精神状态，以攻击之力「碾碎」。（这些是它用来解释<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr3">《波罗夷》三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">《波逸提》六一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">《波逸提》七七</a>中相同措辞的相同术语。意思是，不仅玩弄这个想法。而是已经肯定地下定决心，克服所有犹豫，积极地采取旨在引起射精的行动。）<em>明知</em>意思是知道「我正在努力」——《复注》将其解释为知道「我正在为了射精而努力」。<em>有意识</em>意思是意识到自己的努力正在导致精液的排出。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of “having willed” is where it deviates from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of intention. The Vibhaṅga, throughout its analysis, expresses this factor simply as “aiming at causing an emission,” and it lists ten possible motives for wanting to bring the emission about:</td>

<tr><td>Each of these motives, the Vibhaṅga says, fulfills the factor of intention here. Thus for the Commentary to limit the question of “deliberate intention” strictly to the enjoyment of the act of bringing about an emission (numbers 2 and 10 in the Vibhaṅga’s list) has no basis in the Canon. This means that the factor of intention under this rule is defined by deliberateness and immediate aim—causing an emission of semen—regardless of impulse or motive.</td>
<td>《经分别》说，这些动机中的每一个都满足了这里的意图因素。因此，《义注》将「故意」问题严格限制为享受带来射精的行为（《经分别》列表中的第2和10号）在《圣典》中是没有根据的。这意味著本戒条下的意图因素是由故意和直接目标（导致精液排出）定义的，无论冲动或动机如何。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines four types of effort that fulfill this factor: A bhikkhu causes an emission making an effort (1) at an internal object, (2) at an external object, (3) at both an internal and an external object, or (4) by shaking his pelvis in the air. It then goes on to explain these terms: The internal object is one’s own living body. External objects can either be animate or inanimate objects. The third type of effort involves a combination of the first two, and the fourth covers cases when one makes one’s penis erect (“workable”) by making an effort in the air.</td>
<td>《经分别》定义了满足此因素的四种类型的努力：比丘造成射精借由努力于：（1）内在所缘，（2）外在所缘，（3）内在所缘和外在所缘，或（4）透过在空中摇动骨盆。然后它继续解释这些术语：内在所缘是一个人自己的生命体。外在所缘可以是有生命的或无生命的所缘。第三种类型的努力涉及前两种的组合，第四种涵盖了透过在空中努力使阴茎勃起（「可行」）的情况。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The extremely general nature of these definitions gives the impression that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga wanted them to cover every imaginable type of bodily effort aimed at arousing oneself sexually, and this impression is borne out by the wide variety of cases covered in the Vinīta-vatthu. They include, among others, a bhikkhu who squeezes his penis with his fist, one who rubs his penis with his thumb, one who rubs his penis against his bed, one who inserts his penis into sand, one who bathes against the current in a stream, one who rubs his preceptor’s back in the bathing room, one who gets an erection from the friction of his thighs and robes while walking along, one who has his belly heated in the bathing room, and one who stretches his body. In each of these cases, if the bhikkhu aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.</td>
<td>这些定义极其笼统的性质给人的印象是，《经分别》的编撰者希望它们涵盖所有可以想像到的旨在唤起性欲的身体努力类型，而这种印象在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中涵盖的各种案例中得到了证实。其中包括一位比丘用拳头挤压他的阴茎，一位比丘用拇指摩擦他的阴茎，一位比丘用床摩擦他的阴茎，一位将他的阴茎插入沙子中，一位<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a08">在水流中逆流沐浴</a>。一位是在浴房里摩擦戒师的背部，一位是走路时大腿和袈裟摩擦而勃起的，一位是在浴房里加热腹部的，一位是伸展身体的。在上述每一种情况下，如果比丘目的在于射精并成功，他就会犯《僧残》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu also includes a case in which a bhikkhu, desiring to cause an emission, orders a novice to take hold of his (the bhikkhu’s) penis. He gets his emission and a saṅghādisesa to boot, which shows that getting someone else to make the effort for one fulfills the factor of effort here. Under the factor of consent, below, we will discuss a similar case from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> which indicates that simply lying still while allowing someone else to bring one to an orgasm fulfills the factor of effort here as well.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the factor of effort, though, the Commentary adds an additional sub-factor: that the effort must be directed at one’s own penis. If this were so, then a bhikkhu who succeeded in causing an emission by stimulating any of the erogenous zones of his body aside from his penis would incur no penalty. The Commentary itself actually makes this point, and the Sub-commentary seconds it, although the V/Sub-commentary says that such a bhikkhu would incur a dukkaṭa—what it bases this opinion on, it doesn’t say: perhaps a misreading of the Case of the Sleeping Novice, which we will discuss below.</td>
<td>然而，在讨论努力因素时，《义注》增加了一个额外的子因素：努力必须针对自己的阴茎。如果是这样的话，那么比丘如果透过刺激身体上除阴茎以外的任何性感带而成功地导致射精，就不会受到惩罚。《义注》本身实际上提出了这一点，而《复注》也同意这一点，尽管V/《复注》说这样的比丘会犯《突吉罗》—它并没有说明此观点基于什么：也许是对<strong>睡眠沙弥案例</strong>的误读，我们将在下面讨论。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, the Commentary in adding this last factor runs up against a number of cases in the Vinīta-vatthu in which the effort does not involve the penis: the bhikkhu warming his belly, the bhikkhu rubbing his preceptor’s back, a bhikkhu having his thighs massaged, and others. The Commentary deals with these cases by rewriting them, stating in most cases that the effort somehow had to involve the penis. This in itself is questionable, but when the Commentary actually contradicts the Vinīta-vatthu in the case of the bhikkhu who warms his belly, saying that this sort of effort could not involve an offense at all, even if one aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, the commentators have moved beyond the realm of commenting into the realm of rewriting the rule.</td>
<td>无论如何，《义注》在添加这最后一个因素时遭遇到了《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的许多案例，其中努力不涉及阴茎：比丘温暖他的腹部，比丘摩擦他的戒师的背部，比丘让他的大腿被按摩，等等。《义注》透过改写来处理这些案例，指出在大多数情况下，努力必须以某种方式涉及阴茎。这本身是有问题的，但是当《义注》实际上与《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中比丘温暖腹部的案例相矛盾时，说这种努力根本不涉及犯戒，即使一个人的目的在于射精并成功，注释者已经超越了注释领域，进入了改写戒条的领域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As stated in the Introduction, we have to go on the assumption that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga knew the crucial factors of each offense well enough to know what is and is not an offense, and were careful enough to include all the relevant facts when describing the precedents in the Vinīta-vatthu in order to show how the Buddha arrived at his judgments. Because the Commentary’s position—adding the extra factor that the physical effort has to involve one’s own penis—directly contradicts the Vibhaṅga on this point, the extra factor cannot stand.</td>

<tr><td>The issue here is whose semen was emitted. Pali syntax, unlike English, doesn’t give us a clue, for there is no syntactical rule that the pronoun in one sentence should refer to the subject of the preceding sentence. There are many cases under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a> that follow the form, “A stone badly held by the bhikkhu standing above hit the bhikkhu standing below on the head. The bhikkhu died. He felt conscience-stricken.” In these cases it is obvious from the context within the story which bhikkhu died and which one felt conscience-stricken, while with the sleeping novice we have to look for the context in other parts of the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>这里的问题是谁的精液被排出了。巴利语法与英语不同，没有给我们任何线索，因为没有语法规则要求一个句子中的代名词应该指前一个句子的主词。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr3">《波罗夷》三</a>中有许多案例遵循这样的形式：「站在上面的比丘拙劣地握住一块石头，击中了站在下面的比丘的头部。比丘死了。他感到良心受到谴责。」在这些情况下，从故事的上下文中可以明显看出哪个比丘死了，哪个比丘感到良心受到打击，而对于睡眠的沙弥，我们必须在《经分别》的其他部分寻找上下文。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu was the one who emitted semen, then perhaps there is a contradiction in the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary is justified in saying that the effort must involve one’s penis, for otherwise the case would seem to fulfill the Vibhaṅga’s general definition for the factor of effort: The bhikkhu is making an effort at an outside body and has an emission. Following the general pattern of the rule, he would incur a saṅghādisesa if he intended emission, and no penalty at all if he didn’t. Yet—deviating from the standard pattern for the Vinīta-vatthu cases—the Buddha does not ask whether he aimed at emitting semen, and simply gives the bhikkhu a dukkaṭa, which suggests an inconsistency.</td>
<td>如果比丘是射出精液的人，那么《经分别》中也许存在矛盾，而《义注》说努力必须涉及自己的阴茎是合理的，否则这种情况似乎满足了《经分别》对努力因素的一般定义：比丘对对外部的身体施加努力并且射出精液。按照戒条的一般模式，如果他意图射精，就会犯《僧残》，如果他没有意图射精，则不会受到任何惩罚。然而，与《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例的标准模式不同的是，佛陀并没有问他是否旨在射精，而只是给了比丘《突吉罗》，这表明了不一致。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, the novice was the one who emitted, there is no inconsistency at all: The bhikkhu incurs his dukkaṭa for making lustful bodily contact with another man (see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, below), and the case is included here to show that the full offense under this rule concerns instances where one makes <em>oneself</em> emit semen, and not where one makes others emit. (Other than this case, there is nothing in the rule or the Vibhaṅga that expressly makes this point. The rule simply mentions bringing about the emission of semen, without explicitly mentioning whose. This would explain the bhikkhu’s uncertainty as to whether or not he had committed a saṅghādisesa.) And the reason there is no mention of whether or not the bhikkhu intended to emit semen is because—as it comes under another rule—it is irrelevant to the case.</td>
<td>然而，如果沙弥是射出精液的人，则根本没有矛盾：比丘因与另一个男人进行淫荡的身体接触而犯《突吉罗》（参见下面<a class="reference external" href="#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>的讨论），这个案例被包括在这里，以显示本戒条下的完全违犯涉及一个人使<em>自己</em>射出精液的情况，而不是使他人射出精液的情况。（除了这个例子之外，戒条或《经分别》中没有任何内容明确说明这一点。戒条只是提到导致精液的排出，而没有明确提及是谁的。这可以解释比丘不确定自己是否犯《僧残》。）之所以没有提及比丘是否有意射精，是因为——它属于另一条戒条——与本案例无关。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, inasmuch as the second reading—the novice was the one who had an emission—does no violence to the rest of the Vibhaṅga, it seems to be the preferable one. If this was the case that led the commentators to add their extra factor, we can see that they misread it and that the Vibhaṅga’s original definition for the factor of effort still stands: Any bodily effort made at one’s own body, at another body or physical object, at both, or any effort made in the air—like shaking one’s pelvis or stretching one’s body—fulfills the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>因此，由于第二种读法——沙弥是射精的人——对《经分别》的其余部分没有冲突，所以它似乎是更好的读法。如果正是这种情况导致注释者添加他们的额外因素，我们可以看到他们误读了它，而《经分别》对努力因素的原始定义仍然有效：对自己的身体、对另一个身体或身体对象，或对两者皆是，还是在空中所做的任何努力——比如摇动一个人的骨盆或伸展一个人的身体——所做出的任何身体努力，都满足了这里的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One case that does <em>not</em> fulfill the factor of effort, according to the Vinīta-vatthu, is when one is filled with lust and stares at the private parts of a woman or girl. In the case dealing with this contingency, the bhikkhu emits semen, but again the Buddha does not ask whether he intended to. Instead, he lays down a separate rule, imposing a dukkaṭa for staring lustfully at a woman’s private parts. This suggests that efforts with one’s eyes do not count as bodily efforts under this saṅghādisesa rule, for otherwise the penalty would have been a saṅghādisesa if the bhikkhu had intended emission, and no offense—not a dukkaṭa—if he hadn’t. And this also suggests that the dukkaṭa under this separate rule holds regardless of intention or result. The Commentary adds that this dukkaṭa applies also to staring lustfully at the genitals of a female animal or at the area of a fully-clothed woman’s body where her sexual organ is, thinking, “Her sexual organ is there.” At present we would impose the penalty on a bhikkhu who stares lustfully at a woman’s private parts in a pornographic photograph.</td>
<td>根据《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，一种<em>不</em>满足努力因素的情况是，当一个人充满欲望并盯著女人或女孩的私处时。在处理这种可能发生的情况时，比丘射出精液，但佛陀并没有问他是否有意这样做。相反地，他制定了一条单独的戒条，对<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a02">充满欲望地凝视女性私处，处以《突吉罗》</a>。这表明，在本《僧残》戒条下，用眼睛做的努力不算作身体的努力，否则，如果比丘有意射精，就会受到《僧残》的惩罚；如果他没有无意，则没有犯戒，而不是《突吉罗》。这也表明，无论意图或结果如何，这条单独戒条下的《突吉罗》都成立。《义注》补充说，这种《突吉罗》也适用于充满欲望地凝视雌性动物的生殖器，或盯著穿著衣服的女性身体的性器官所在的区域，心想：「她的性器官就在那里。」目前，我们会对在色情照片中充满欲望地凝视女性私处的比丘施以此惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see under the non-offense clauses, there is no offense in a nocturnal emission. The Commentary, however, discusses the question of conscious efforts made prior to sleep aimed at a nocturnal emission, and arrives at the following verdicts: If a bhikkhu, “usurped” with lust while lying down, grabs his penis with his fist or thighs and drops off to sleep maintaining that position in hopes of inducing an emission, he incurs the full offense if the emission takes place. If, however, he suppresses his “lust-usurpation” by reflecting on the foulness of the body and then dozes off with a pure mind, he incurs no offense even if an emission later occurs. The analysis here seems to be that the bhikkhu’s change of mind would separate the emission from the earlier effort enough so that it would not be regarded as a direct result of that effort. The Sub-commentary adds that, in addition to suppressing the lust in his mind, he also has to discontinue his effort to be free of an offense in this way. And both texts have to be qualified by saying that the “no offense” would apply only to the emission, for the earlier intentional effort would incur a thullaccaya.</td>
<td>正如我们将在不犯条款中看到的，遗精并不构成犯戒。然而，《义注》讨论了在睡眠前为了遗精而有意识地努力的问题，并得出以下结论：如果比丘在躺下时被欲望「侵占」，用拳头或大腿抓住他的阴茎，入睡时保持该姿势以期引起遗精，如果发生遗精，他将完全违犯此戒条。然而，如果他透过反思身体的不净来抑制「欲望篡夺」，然后以清净的心入睡，即使后来发生遗精，他也不会犯戒。这里的分析似乎是，比丘改变心意，会将射精与先前的努力充分分开，这样它就不会被视为该努力的直接结果。《复注》又说，除了抑制内心的欲望之外，他还必须停止他的努力而免于以这种方式犯戒。这两篇文本都必须加以限定，即「不犯」仅适用于射精，因为更早之前的故意努力会犯《偷兰遮》。</td>

Thus, given the facts as we have them, it would seem that consent under this rule can be expressed physically simply by letting the act happen.

Otherwise, one would incur a thullaccaya simply for moving one’s legs. <em>Sensual fever</em>, here, probably refers to the desire to cause an emission, for there are several spots where the Commentary discusses bhikkhus who stimulate an erection simply for the enjoyment of the contact rather than to cause an emission, and the judgment is that they incur no penalty, even if an emission does inadvertently result.</td>
<td>在讨论一位大腿肥大的比丘，只要走路就勃起的案例时，《义注》提到，如果在这种情况下发现欲「烧」，必须立即停止行走，并开始观照身体的不净，以便在继续前进之前净化内心。否则，仅仅因为移动双腿就会招致《偷兰遮》。这里的<em>欲烧</em>可能是指想要引起射精的欲望，因为《义注》中有好几处讨论了比丘刺激勃起的原因，他们只是为了享受接触的乐趣而不是为了引起射精，而判决结果是，即使无意中造成了射精，他们也不会受到惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Aside from the thullaccaya, the Vibhaṅga assigns no other derived offenses under this rule. A bhikkhu who has an ejaculation while thinking sensual thoughts but without making any physical effort to cause it, incurs no penalty regardless of whether the idea crosses his mind that he would like to have an emission, and regardless of whether he enjoys it when it occurs. However, the Commentary notes here that even though there is no offense involved, one should not let oneself be overcome by sensual thoughts in this way. This point is borne out by the famous simile that occurred to Prince Siddhattha before his Awakening and that later, as Buddha, he related to a number of listeners:</td>
<td>除了《偷兰遮》之外，《经分别》在本戒条下没有指定任何其他衍生违犯。比丘在想性欲念头时射精，但没有付出任何身体努力来导致射精，无论他的心中是否有想要射精的念头，也无论当射精发生时他是否享受它，都不会受到惩罚。然而，《义注》在此指出，即使没有犯戒，也不应该这样让自己被欲念所征服。悉达多太子在成佛之前，后来成为佛陀时，对许多听众讲了一个著名的比喻，证实了这一点：</td>

However, the Commentary goes on to rule out this overly literal interpretation, stating that what happens in the mind while one is sleeping falls in the bounds of the Abhidhamma, but what happens after one awakens falls within the bounds of the Vinaya; and that there is no such thing as a misdeed performed when one is in a “non-negligible” state of mind that does not count as an offense.

<tr><td>In making the exception for what happens while asleep, the Buddha states that even though there may be the intention to cause an emission, it doesn’t count. The Commentary goes on to say, however, that if a bhikkhu fully awakens in the course of a wet dream, he should lie still and be extremely careful not to make a move that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. If the process has reached the point where it is irreversible and the ejaculation occurs spontaneously, he incurs no penalty regardless of whether he enjoys it. And as the Commentary quotes from the Kurundī, one of the ancient Sinhalese commentaries on which it is based, if he wakes up in the course of a wet dream and grabs hold of his penis to prevent the ejaculation from soiling his robes or bedding, there is no offense.<!-- 觉音论师注释书略述

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga explains the term <em>overcome with lust</em> as meaning “impassioned, desiring, a mind bound by attraction.” <em>Altered</em>, it says, can refer in general to one of three states of mind—passion, aversion, or delusion—but here it refers specifically to passion.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary also tries to limit the range of passion to which this rule applies, saying that it covers only desire for the enjoyment of contact. As we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, the ancient commentators formulated a list of eleven types of lust, each mutually exclusive, and the question of which rule applies to a particular case depends on which type of lust provokes the bhikkhu’s actions. Thus if a bhikkhu lusting for intercourse touches a woman, it says, he incurs only a dukkaṭa as a preliminary to sexual intercourse under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>. If he touches her through his lust for an ejaculation, he incurs a thullaccaya as a preliminary to causing an emission under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>. Only if he touches her with the simple desire to enjoy the sensation of contact does he incur a saṅghādisesa under this rule.</td>
<td>《义注》也试图限制本戒条适用的激情范围，称它仅涵盖享受接触的欲望。正如我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr1">《波罗夷》一</a>中所指出的，古代注释者列出了十一种贪欲的清单，每种贪欲都是相互排斥的，而哪种戒条适用于某个特定情况的问题取决于哪种类型的贪欲会激起比丘的行动。因此，如果一个欲求性交的比丘触摸一个女人，它说，他只会犯《突吉罗》，作为<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr1">《波罗夷》一</a>下性交的预备。如果他出于射精的欲望而触摸她，他就会犯《偷兰遮》，作为<a class="reference external" href="#sg1">《僧残》一</a>下引起射精的预备。只有当他怀著享受接触感觉的纯粹欲望去触碰她时，他才会根据本戒条犯《僧残》。</td>

We can stick with the Vibhaṅga to this rule and say that <em>any</em> state of passion fulfills the factor of intention here. The Commentary’s discussion, though, is useful in showing that the passion needn’t be full-scale sexual lust. Even a momentary desire to enjoy the sensation of physical contact—overwhelming enough that one acts on it—is enough to fulfill this factor.</td>

The Vinīta-vatthu includes a case of a bhikkhu giving a woman a blow with his shoulder: He too incurs a saṅghādisesa, which shows that the Vibhaṅga’s list is meant to cover all similar actions as well.

As noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, mouth-to-mouth penetration with any human being or common animal would incur a thullaccaya.

<tr><td>However, in the context of this rule, and other rules in the Pāṭimokkha where paṇḍakas enter into the calculation of an offense, the Commentary does not say whether <em>paṇḍaka</em> covers all five types of paṇḍakas or only those not allowed to ordain. In other words, in the context of these rules do “sprinkled ones” and voyeurs count as paṇḍakas or men? In the context of this rule the practical implications of the distinction are minor: If counted as men, they would be grounds for a dukkaṭa; if paṇḍakas, grounds for a thullaccaya. However, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">Pc 6</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">44</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">45</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">67</a>, the distinction makes the difference between an offense and a non-offense, and so it is an important one to draw. There seems good reason to count them as men under all rules, for if they could ordain and yet were considered paṇḍakas under these rules, the texts would have been obliged to deal with the issue of how bhikkhus were to treat validly ordained paṇḍakas in their midst in the context of these rules. But they don’t. This shows that the issue never arose, which means that, for the purposes of all the rules, these two types of individuals count as men.</td>
<td>然而，在本戒条的脉络下，以及《波罗提木叉》中将黄门纳入犯戒计算的其他戒条中，《义注》并没有说明<em>黄门</em>是否涵盖所有五种类型的黄门或仅涵盖那些不允许出家的类型。换句话说，在这些戒条的脉络下，「被注入者」和窥淫癖者算是「黄门」还是「男人」？在本戒条的戒条下，这种区别的实际含义是较不重要的：如果被算作男人，他们将成为《突吉罗》的理由；如果是黄门，则为《偷兰遮》的理由。然而，在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">《波逸提》六</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">四四</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">四五</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">六七</a>下，这一区别决定了犯戒和不犯之间的区别，因此这是一个重要的问题。似乎有充分的理由在所有戒条下将他们视为男人，因为如果他们能够出家，但在这些戒条下仍被视为黄门，那么文献就必须处理比丘如何对待他们之中的有效出家的黄门的问题。但文献没有。这表明这个问题从未出现过，这意味著，就所有戒条而言，这两类人都算是男性。</td>

<tr><td>Otherwise, the Vibhaṅga does not discuss the issue of bhikkhus who intentionally make active contact with women for purposes other than lust or affection—e.g., helping a woman who has fallen into a raging river—but the Commentary does. It introduces the concept of <em>anāmāsa</em>, things carrying a dukkaṭa penalty when touched; women and women’s clothing top the list. (See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0072.html#BMC2appendixFIVE">BMC2, Appendix V</a> for the entire list.) It then goes into great detail to tell how one should behave when one’s mother falls into a raging river. Under no circumstances, it says, should one grab hold of her, although one may extend a rope, a board, etc., in her direction. If she happens to grab hold of her son the bhikkhu, he should not shake her off but should simply let her hold on as he swims back to shore.</td>
<td>除此之外，《经分别》并没有讨论比丘出于欲望或感情以外的目的而故意与女人主动接触的问题，例如帮助落入汹涌河流的女人，但《义注》却讨论了这一问题。它引入了 <em>anāmāsa</em> 的概念，即触摸时会受到《突吉罗》惩罚的事物；女人和女人的服装位居榜首。（完整清单请参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0072.html#BMC2appendixFIVE">《佛教修道准则 第二册》附录五</a>）然后，它详细讲述了当母亲掉进汹涌的河流时应该如何行动。它说，在任何情况下，都不应抓住她，尽管可以向她的方向伸出一根绳子、一块木板等。如果她碰巧抓住了她的儿子比丘，他不应该把她甩开，而应该让她抓住，然后游回岸边。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Where the Commentary gets the concept of <em>anāmāsa</em> is hard to say. Perhaps it came from the practices of the brahman caste, who are very careful not to touch certain things and people of certain lower castes. At any rate, there is no direct basis for it in the Canon. Although the concept has received wide acceptance in Theravādin Communities, many highly respected Vinaya experts have made an exception right here, saying that there is nothing wrong in touching a woman when one’s action is based not on lust but on a desire to save her from danger. Even if there is an offense in doing so, there are other places where Buddhaghosa recommends that one be willing to incur a minor penalty for the sake of compassion (e.g., digging a person out of a hole into which he has fallen), and the same principle surely holds here.</td>
<td>很难说《义注》中的 <em>anāmāsa</em> 概念是从哪里得到的。也许这来自婆罗门种姓的习俗，婆罗门种姓非常小心，不接触某些低种姓的某些事物和人。无论如何，在《圣典》里并没有直接的依据。尽管这个概念在上座部僧团中得到了广泛接受，但许多德高望重的律宗专家却在这里破例，他们说，当一个人的行为不是基于欲望而是出于拯救她脱离危险的愿望时，触摸女性并没有什么错。即使这样做是犯戒的，<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>在其他地方也建议人们出于慈悲心而愿意受到轻微的惩罚（例如，将一个人从掉进的洞里挖出来），并且同样的原则在这里肯定成立。</td>

<tr><td>These penalties for indirect contact have inspired the Commentary to say that if a bhikkhu makes contact with a clothed portion of a woman’s body or uses a clothed portion of his body to make contact with hers, and the cloth is so thick that neither his body hairs nor hers can penetrate it, the penalty is only a thullaccaya because he is not making direct contact. Only if the contact is skin-to-skin, skin-to-hair, or hair-to-hair (as might be possible through thin cloth) does he commit the full offense. Thus a bhikkhu who fondles the breasts, buttocks, or crotch of a fully clothed woman would incur only a thullaccaya because the contact was indirect.</td>
<td>这些对间接接触的惩罚启发《义注》说，如果比丘接触女性身体的穿著部分，或者用自己身体的穿著部分接触她的身体，而且衣服很厚，以至于他跟她的身体上没有毛发可以穿透它，惩罚只是《偷兰遮》，因为他没有直接接触。只有当接触是皮肤对皮肤、皮肤对头发或头发对头发（可能透过薄布）时，他才构成完全犯戒。因此，比丘抚摸衣著整齐的女人的胸部、臀部或胯部时，只会犯《偷兰遮》，因为这种接触是间接的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is a certain logic to the commentators’ assertion here, but why they adopted it is unclear. Perhaps they drew a parallel to the following rule—concerning lustful remarks made to a woman—which also contains derived offenses for remarks directed at items “connected with the body.” In that case, defining <em>connected with the body</em> to include clothing worn by the woman does no violence to the nature of the activity covered by the rule, for it is possible to make remarks about a woman’s clothing without using words that touch on her body at all.</td>
<td>注释者的说法有一定的逻辑性，但为什么会这样，却不得而知。也许他们与以下戒条（关于对女性发表淫欲言论）进行了类比，该戒条还包含针对「与身体相连」的物品的言论的衍生违犯。在该情况下，将<em>与身体相连</em>的定义包括女性所穿的衣服并不违反戒条所涵盖的活动的性质，因为可以在不使用触及女性身体的词语的情况下对女性的衣服进行评论。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Here, however, the nature of the activity is different. If one pushes a woman, it does not matter how many layers of cloth lie between her body and one’s hand: One is pushing both the cloth and her. If one squeezes her fully clothed breasts, again, one is squeezing both the cloth and the breasts. To say that one is pushing or squeezing only the cloth is a denial of the true nature of the action. Also, if one stroked a woman’s fully clothed thigh, it is unlikely that the strength of her reaction would depend on whether her body hairs penetrated the cloth, or if one was wearing latex gloves that prevented her hair from touching one’s skin. Common linguistic usage reflects these facts, as does the law.</td>
<td>然而，这里的活动性质有所不同。如果一个人推著一个女人，不管她的身体和手之间有多少层布：一个人既在推布，也在推她。如果一个人挤压她穿著衣服的乳房，那么，一个人同时挤压了衣服和乳房。如果说一个人只推或挤压布料，那就是对这动作真实性质的否认。此外，如果有人抚摸一位女性穿著衣服的大腿，她的反应强度不太可能取决于她的体毛是否穿透了布料，或者是否戴著乳胶手套以防止她的头发接触自己的皮肤。常见的语言用法反映了这些事实，法律也是如此。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question is, does the Vibhaṅga follow this common linguistic usage, and the answer appears to be Yes. In none of the Vinīta-vatthu cases concerning physical contact with women does the Buddha ever ask the bhikkhu if he made contact with the clothed or unclothed portions of the woman’s body. This suggests that the question of whether she was clothed or unclothed is irrelevant to the offense. In one of the cases, “a certain bhikkhu, seeing a woman he encountered coming in the opposite direction, was impassioned and gave her a blow with his shoulder.” Now, bhikkhus sometimes have their shoulders bared and sometimes robed; women walking along a road may have different parts of their body clothed or bared. If the presence or absence of a layer or two of cloth between the bhikkhu’s shoulder and the woman’s body were relevant to the severity of the offense, then given the Buddha’s usual thoroughness in cases like this he would have asked about the amount, location, and thickness of clothing on both the bhikkhu and the woman, to determine if the offense was a dukkaṭa, a thullaccaya, or a saṅghādisesa. But he didn’t. He simply penalized the bhikkhu with a saṅghādisesa, which again suggests that the presence or absence of cloth between the bhikkhu and the woman is irrelevant in all cases under this rule.</td>
<td>问题是，《经分别》是否遵循这种常见的语言用法，答案似乎是肯定的。在所有涉及与女性身体接触的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例中，佛陀都没有问过比丘是否接触过女性身体的有衣或无衣部分。这显示她是否穿衣服的问题与犯戒无关。在其中一个案例中，「一位比丘，看到他遇到的一位女人朝相反的方向走来，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a05">充满激情地用肩膀碰了她</a>。」现在，比丘有时裸露肩膀，有时穿著袈裟；走在路上的女人可能会在身体的不同部位穿衣服或裸露。如果比丘的肩膀和女人的身体之间有或没有一层或两层布与犯戒的严重程度有关，那么鉴于佛陀在这种情况下一贯的彻底性，他会询问比丘和女人的衣服的数量、位置和厚度，以确定所犯的罪行是《突吉罗》、《偷兰遮》还是《僧残》。但他没有。他只是用《僧残》惩罚比丘，这再次表明，在本戒条下，比丘和女人之间有或没有衣服在所有情况下都是无关紧要的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The only cases of indirect contact mentioned in the Vinīta-vatthu refer to contact of a much more remote sort: A bhikkhu pulls a cord of which a woman is holding the other end, pulls a stick of which she is holding the other end, or gives her a playful push with his bowl.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中提到的间接接触的唯一情况是指一种更遥远的接触：<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a07">比丘拉一根绳子，而女人握住另一端，拉动一根棍子，而女人握住另一端</a>，或者<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a09">顽皮地用钵推了她一下</a>。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus in the context of this rule the Vibhaṅga defines “object connected to the body,” through which indirect contact is made, with examples of things that the person is <em>holding</em>. The Vinaya-mukha adds things that are <em>hanging</em> from the person, like the hem of a robe or a dress. In this context, contact made through cloth that the person is wearing would be classed as direct. This would parallel <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, in which the question of whether there is anything covering either of the organs involved in intercourse is completely irrelevant to the offense. Thus the concept of direct and indirect contact here would seem to follow general linguistic usage: If a woman is wearing a long-sleeved shirt, for instance, grabbing her by the arm and grabbing her by the cuff of her shirt are two different things, and would receive different penalties under this rule.</td>
<td>因此，在本戒条的脉络下，《经分别》定义了「与身体相连的物体」，透过它进行间接接触，并以人所<em>持有</em>的东西为例。《戒律入口》添加了<em>悬挂</em>在人身上的东西，例如袈裟或服装的折边。在这种脉络下，透过人所穿的衣服进行的接触将被归类为直接接触。这与<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr1">《波罗夷》一</a>类似，其中是否有任何东西覆盖涉及性交的器官的问题与犯戒完全无关。因此，这里直接和间接接触的概念似乎遵循一般语言用法：例如，如果一个女人穿著长袖衬衫，抓住她的手臂和抓住她衬衫的袖口是两个不同的事情，并根据本戒条受到不同的惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>According to the Vibhaṅga, if a bhikkhu feels desire for contact with a woman and makes an effort that does not achieve even indirect contact—e.g., making a squeezing motion in the air near one of her breasts—the penalty is a dukkaṭa.</td>

The editors of the Thai edition of the Canon have interpreted the parallelism with the similar paragraph in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> as indicating that “man” and “animal” <em>would</em> come under the ellipses, and so have included these cases in the text.

<tr><td>There is, however, a pattern to the Vinīta-vatthu cases. The thullaccaya case is the only one in which the bhikkhu actually mentions a word for genitals or anus (<em>magga</em>, which also means road, the meaning the woman understood). In the dukkaṭa cases, bhikkhus either use euphemisms for sexual intercourse (“plowing,” “working”) or else they make statements in which the words <em>genitals</em> or <em>anus</em> are implied but not actually stated. From this pattern we can argue that if a bhikkhu speaking to a woman makes direct reference to her genitals or anus, and the woman doesn’t immediately understand that he is referring to those things, he incurs a thullaccaya. If he makes a euphemistic reference to sexual intercourse or an implied reference to her genitals or anus, and she doesn’t immediately understand what he is referring to, he incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense for a bhikkhu who speaks aiming at (spiritual) welfare (<em>attha</em>—this can also mean the “meaning of the Dhamma”), aiming at Dhamma, or aiming at teaching. Thus, for example, if one is talking in front of women and has no lustful intent, one may recite or explain this training rule or go into detail on the topic of the loathsomeness of the body as a topic of meditation, all without incurring a penalty. The Commentary here adds an example of a bhikkhu addressing a sexually deformed woman, telling her to be heedful in her practice so as not to be born that way again. If, however, one were to broach any of these topics out of a desire to enjoy saying something lewd to one’s listeners, one would not be immune from an offense. The New K/Sub-commentary illustrates this point with an example: A bhikkhu, teaching the Vibhaṅga of this rule to a bhikkhunī, departs from a normal tone of voice and keeps sniggering while reciting the examples of lewd speech. This sort of behavior, it says, incurs the full offense here.</td>

<tr><td>“Giving,” in the Buddha’s time, was a common euphemism for having sex. If a woman “gave” to a man, that meant that she willingly engaged in sexual intercourse with him. Now, Buddhism was not the only religion of the time to teach that gifts—of a more innocent sort—given to contemplatives produced great reward to those who gave them, and ultimately somebody somewhere came up with the idea that because sex was the highest gift, giving it to a contemplative would produce the highest reward. Whether this idea was first formulated by faithful women or by clever contemplatives is hard to say. Several cases in the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> tell of bhikkhus approached or attacked by women professing this belief, which shows that it had some currency: Sex was somehow seen as a way to higher benefits through the law of kamma.</td>
<td>在佛陀时代，「给予」是性行为的常见委婉说法。如果一个女人「给予」一个男人，那就意味著她愿意与他发生性关系。现在，佛教并不是当时唯一的宗教教导说：给予沙门的布施（单纯的那种）会给那些给予布施的人带来巨大的回报，最终有人提出了这样的想法，因为性是最高的布施，将其给予沙门将产生最高的回报。很难说这个想法最初是由忠实的女性提出的，还是由聪明的沙门提出的。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr1">《波罗夷》一</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的几个案例讲述了比丘受到自称这种信仰的女人接近或攻击的情况，这表明它具有一定的流行性：性在某种程度上被视为透过业力法则获得更高利益的一种方式。</td>

<tr><td>Because the preceding rule gives exemptions for bhikkhus speaking “aiming at (spiritual) welfare <em>(attha)</em>, aiming at Dhamma,” some misguided souls who did not comprehend the Buddha’s teachings on sensuality might believe that welfare of this sort might fit under the exemption. The origin story alludes to this point in a punning way, in that the word for “need” is also <em>attha</em>, and perhaps the widow, in using the word, had both its meanings in mind: Her spiritual welfare would be enhanced by meeting a bhikkhu’s needs. Even today, although the rationale might be different, there are people who believe that having sex with spiritual teachers is beneficial for one’s spiritual well being. Thus we have this separate rule to show that the Buddha would have no part in such a notion, and that a bhikkhu who tries to suggest that his listener would benefit from having sex with him is not exempt from an offense.</td>
<td>因为前一戒条给予比丘「为了（精神）福祉<em>（attha）</em>、为了法」而说的豁免，一些不理解佛陀关于欲乐教义的被误导心灵可能会认为这种福祉可能属于豁免范围。起源故事以双关语的方式间接提到了这一点，因为「需要」这个词也是 <em>attha</em>，也许寡妇在使用这个词时考虑到了它的两种含义：她的精神福祉将通过满足比丘的需要而得到增强。即使在今天，尽管理由可能有所不同，但仍有人相信与灵性导师发生性关系对灵性健康有益。因此，我们有这条单独的戒条来表明佛陀不会参与这样的观念，而试图暗示听众会从与他发生性关系中受益的比丘也不能免于犯戒。</td>

In other words, given this sort of desire, this sort of statement is allowable. From this interpretation it can be argued that when a bhikkhu is speaking without any lust or sensual desire of any sort, he may make any of the remarks that would fulfill the factor of effort here in the presence of others without incurring an offense. A prime example would be when, while explaining this rule, he quotes examples of the remarks it forbids.</td>

A bhikkhu planning to disrobe who asks a woman if she would be interested in marrying him after his return to lay life would incur a dukkaṭa for inquiring. If, on the way to inquire about a woman after accepting a man’s request to inquire about her, a bhikkhu asks people along the way of her whereabouts, that does not count as inquiring.

<tr><td>The Canon repeatedly refers to two arrangements for the ownership of dwellings used by bhikkhus: They belong either to the Community or to an individual (or group of individuals). From the point of view of Community governance, the prior arrangement is preferable, for the Community can then allot the dwelling as it sees fit (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>). Also, a number of the rules governing the care and use of huts—such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">Pc 15</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc16">16</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc17">17</a>—apply only to dwellings belonging to the Community.</td>
<td>《圣典》一再提到比丘所使用的住处的所有权有两种安排：它们要么属于僧团，要么属于个人（或个人团体）。从僧团治理的角度来看，事先安排是更可取的，因为僧团可以根据需要分配住处（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第十八章</a>）。此外，许多管理小屋维护和使用的戒条（例如<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">《波逸提》十五</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc16">十六</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc17">十七</a>）仅适用于属于僧团的住处。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to this rule defines <em>destined for himself</em> as “for his own use.” On the surface this could mean that one plans to use the hut after handing ownership over to the Community, but the Commentary states that this is not so. To dedicate something for one’s own use, it says, is to claim ownership over it: In this case, one regards the dwelling as “mine.” The Commentary’s position is supported by the protocols followed by the lodging bestower and lodging assignor (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>) in allotting dwellings belonging to the Community: Outside of the Rains-residence, a bhikkhu could be moved from a Community dwelling at any time; during the Rains-residence, the bhikkhu who built a particular dwelling might find himself unable to stay there because many bhikkhus with more seniority or more pressing needs had decided to spend the Rains in that location. Thus if a bhikkhu planned the dwelling for his own use, he would not want it to be subject to the protocols governing Community dwellings.</td>
<td>本戒条的《经分别》将<em>为自己建造</em><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a10">定义为「供他自己使用」</a>。从表面上看，这可能意味著计划在将所有权移交给僧团后使用小屋，但《义注》指出事实并非如此。它说，将某物奉献给自己使用，就是声称对其拥有所有权：在这种情况下，将住处视为「我的」。《义注》的立场得到了住宿赠予者和住宿分配者在分配属于僧团的住处时所遵循的行仪（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第十八章</a>）的支持：在雨安居之外，比丘可以随时从僧团住处搬走；在雨安居期间，建造特定住处的比丘可能会发现自己无法住在那里，因为许多戒腊较高或有更迫切需要的比丘决定在该地点度过雨安居。因此，如果比丘计划将住处供自己使用，他不希望它受到管理僧团住处的行仪的约束。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s interpretation thus suggests that this rule and the following one were intended to discourage bhikkhus from maintaining ownership over the huts they build, for as the non-offense clauses state, the stipulations in this rule do not apply to huts built for the use of others. As the Commentary notes, this exemption applies both to huts built for other people—such as one’s preceptor or mentor—or for the Community. This would open a loophole for one to build a hut for another bhikkhu and for him to claim ownership over it independently of the Community, all without following the stipulations under the rules, but apparently the compilers of the Vibhaṅga did not regard the act of building a hut as a gift for another bhikkhu as something they had the right to forbid.</td>
<td>因此，《义注》的解释表明，本戒条和以下一条戒条的目的是阻碍比丘保留对其所建造的小屋的所有权，因为正如不犯条款所规定的那样，本戒条中的规定不适用于为其他人使用而建造的小屋。正如《义注》所指出的，这项豁免适用于为其他人（例如戒师或导师）或为僧团建造的小屋。这将打开一个漏洞，让某人为另一位比丘建造一间小屋，并让他独立于僧团而声称拥有它的所有权，所有这些都没有遵守戒条的规定，但显然，《经分别》的编纂者并没有考虑建造一间小屋作为礼物送给另一位比丘的行为，因为他们有权禁止这样做。</td>

<tr><td>This factor is divided into two main sub-factors: the hut and the procedures that need to be followed to get the Community’s permission for its construction.</td>
<td>此因素分为两个主要子因素：小屋和获得僧团许可建造小屋所需遵循的程序。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The hut.</em> The Vibhaṅga defines a hut as “plastered inside, outside, or both.” It also states that this rule does not apply to a <em>leṇa</em>, a <em>guhā</em>, or to a grass hut. A leṇa, according to the Commentary, is a cave. A guhā it doesn’t define, except to say that guhās may be built out of wood, stone, or earth. And as for a grass hut, the Commentary says that this refers to any building with a grass <em>roof</em>, which means that even a dwelling with plastered walls but a grass roof would not count as a hut under this rule (although a hut whose roof has been plastered and then covered with grass <em>would</em> count as a hut here).</td>
<td><em>小屋。</em>《经分别》<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a08">将小屋定义为「内部、外部或两者都涂有灰泥」</a>。它还指出，本戒条不适用于 <em>leṇa</em> 、 <em>guhā</em> 或草屋。根据《义注》， <em>leṇa</em> 是一个洞穴。它没有定义 guhā ，只是说 guhā 可以用木材、石头或泥土来建造。至于草屋，《义注》中说，这是指任何有草<em>屋顶</em>的建筑物，这意味著即使是抹灰墙但有草屋顶的住处，在本戒条下也不能算作小屋（虽然屋顶被抹灰然后覆盖草的小屋在这里<em>也</em>算是小屋）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary goes on to stipulate that the plastering mentioned in the Vibhaṅga refers to a plastered <em>roof</em>, that the plaster must be either clay or white lime (plastering with cow dung or mud doesn’t count, although cement would probably come under “white lime” here), and that the plastering on the inside or outside of the roof must be contiguous with the plastering on the inside or outside of the walls. Thus if the builder leaves a gap in the plastering around the top of the wall so that the plastering of the roof and the plastering of the walls don’t touch at any point, the building doesn’t qualify as a hut and so doesn’t come under the rule.</td>
<td>《义注》接著规定，《经分别》中所提到的抹灰指的是抹灰的<em>屋顶</em>，抹灰必须是粘土或白石灰（用牛粪或泥土抹灰不算，尽管水泥可能属于此处的「白石灰」），且屋顶内侧或外侧的抹灰必须与墙壁内侧或外侧的抹灰互相连接。因此，如果建筑者在墙顶周围的抹灰中留下了一个间隙，使得屋顶的抹灰和墙壁的抹灰在任何一点都不会接触，那么该建筑就不符合小屋的资格，因此不受戒条约束。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Sub-commentary treats the question raised by the Commentary’s emphasis on the plastering of the roof: Does this mean that a dwelling with a plastered roof but unplastered walls would also count as a hut? Arguing from the Commentary’s many references to making the roof-plastering contiguous with the wall-plastering, the Sub-commentary concludes that the answer is No: Both the roof and the walls must be plastered.</td>
<td>《复注》处理了《义注》中强调屋顶抹灰所提出的问题：这是否意味著屋顶抹灰但墙壁未抹灰的住处也算是小屋？根据《义注》中多次提及使屋顶抹灰与墙壁抹灰互相连接，《复注》得出的结论是答案是否定的：屋顶和墙壁都必须抹灰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The commentaries’ stipulations on these points may seem like attempts to create gaping loopholes in the rule, but there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove them wrong. Perhaps in those days only buildings that were fully plastered, roof and all, were considered to be finished, permanent structures, while everything else was considered makeshift and temporary and thus not worth the fuss and bother of the procedures we will discuss below.</td>
<td>注释对这些要点的规定可能看起来像是试图在戒条中制造巨大的漏洞，但《经分别》中没有任何内容可以证明它们是错的。也许在那些时日里，只有完全抹灰的建筑物，包括屋顶和所有东西，才被认为是完成的、永久性的结构，而其他一切都被认为是临时凑合的，因此不值得我们在下面讨论的程序中大惊小怪和麻烦。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At another point in its discussions, the Commentary adds that any building three sugata spans wide or less is not big enough to move a bed around in and so does not count as a hut under this rule. The Commentary itself defines a sugata span as three times the span of a normal person, which would put it at approximately 75 cm. More recent calculations based on the fact that the Buddha was not abnormally tall set the sugata span at 25 cm.</td>
<td>在讨论的另一点上，《义注》补充说，任何宽度为三善至张手或更小的建筑物都不足以移动一张床，因此根据本戒条不算作小屋。《义注》本身将善至张手定义为正常人张手的三倍，即大约 75 公分。根据佛陀身高并无异常的事实，最近的计算将善至张手设定为 25 公分。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The maximum size of the hut</em>, as the rule states, is no more than twelve spans long and seven spans wide, or approximately 3 x 1.75 meters. For some reason the Vibhaṅga states that the length of the hut is measured from the outside (excluding the plastering, says the Commentary), while the width is measured from the inside. Neither of these measurements may be exceeded even by the breadth of a hair. Thus a hut measuring ten by eight spans, even though it has less floor area than a twelve-by-seven-span hut, would exceed the standard width and so would be a violation of this rule.</td>
<td>依戒条，<em>小屋的最大尺寸</em>不得超过长十二张手、宽七张手，即约 3 x 1.75 公尺。由于某种原因，《经分别》规定，小屋的长度是从外部测量的（《义注》中说，不包括抹灰），而宽度是从内部测量的。即使是一根头发丝的宽度也不能超过这些尺寸。因此，一个十张手乘以八张手的小屋，即使其建筑面积比十二张手乘以七张手的小屋小，也会超出标准宽度，因此会违反本戒条。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The procedures</em>. If, for his own use, a bhikkhu is planning to build a hut as defined in this rule, he must choose a site, clear it, and ask for a Community to inspect and approve it before he can go ahead with the actual construction.</td>
<td><em>程序</em>。如果比丘打算按照本戒条建造一间小屋供自己使用，他必须选择一个地点，清理它，并请求僧团检查和批准，然后才能继续实际建造。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>The site</em> must be free of disturbances and have adequate space.</td>
<td>—<em>场地</em>必须不受干扰并有合适的空间。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga gives a long list of “disturbances,” which for ease of understanding we can divide into three categories: A site free of disturbances is (1) not the abode of such creatures as termites, ants, or rats who might do harm to the building. (2) It is not the abode of those—such as snakes, scorpions, tigers, lions, elephants, or bears—who might do harm to its inhabitant. The Commentary states that the Vibhaṅga’s purpose in forbidding a bhikkhu from building on a site where termites and other small animals have their home is to show compassion to these and other small creatures like them by not destroying their nests. As for the stipulation against building where snakes and other dangerous animals live, this also extends, it says, to the areas where they regularly forage for food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0210a09">《经分别》列出了一长串「干扰」清单</a>，为了便于理解，我们可以将其分为三类：没有干扰的场所是（1）不是白蚁、蚂蚁或老鼠等可能对建筑物造成损害的生物的住所。（2）它不是蛇、蝎子、老虎、狮子、大象或熊等可能伤害其居住者的动物的住所。《义注》指出，《经分别》禁止比丘在白蚁和其他小动物栖息的地方建造房屋的目的是为了表达对白蚁和其他小动物的慈悲，不破坏它们的巢穴。至于禁止在蛇等危险动物居住的地方建造建筑的规定，也适用于蛇等危险动物经常觅食的区域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>(3) The site is not near any places that will disturb the bhikkhu’s peace and quiet. Examples given in the Vibhaṅga are: fields, orchards, places of execution, cemeteries, pleasure groves, royal property, elephant stables, horse stables, prisons, taverns, slaughterhouses, highways, crossroads, public rest-houses, and meeting places.</td>
<td>（3）该地点不靠近任何会扰乱比丘安宁的地方。《经分别》中所举的例子有：田野、果园、刑场、墓园、游园、皇家地产、象厩、马厩、监狱、酒馆、屠宰场、高速公路、十字路口、公共休息室和聚会场所。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Adequate space</em> means that there is enough room on the site for a yoked wagon or a man carrying a ladder to go around the proposed hut. The question arises as to whether this means that all trees within that radius of the hut must be cut down or simply that there must be enough land around the hut so that if the trees were not there it would be possible to go around the hut in the ways mentioned. The Sub-commentary states that the stipulation for adequate space is so that the hut will not be built on the edge of a precipice or next to a cliff wall, and the Vinaya-mukha notes that the Vibhaṅga here is following the Laws of Manu (an ancient Indian legal text) in ensuring that the dwelling not be built right against someone else’s property. Both of these statements suggest that there is no need to cut the trees down.</td>
<td><em>合适的空间</em>意味著场地上有足够的空间供一辆有轭的马车或一个携带梯子的人在拟建造的小屋周围行走。问题是，这是否意味著小屋半径内的所有树木都必须被砍伐，或者只是小屋周围必须有足够的土地，这样如果没有树木，就可以在小屋周围以提到的方式行走。《复注》指出，对合适空间的规定如是，以至于小屋不能建在悬崖边缘或悬崖壁旁边，而《戒律入口》指出，这里的《经分别》遵循<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%91%A9%E5%A5%B4%E6%B3%95%E8%AB%96">《摩奴法典》</a>（古印度法律文本），以确保住处不会侵犯他人的财产。这两种说法都显示没有必要砍伐树木。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha deduces further from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion that the procedures for getting the site approved are concerned basically with laying claim to unclaimed land and thus don’t need to be followed in locations where the Community already owns the land, such as in a monastery; if a bhikkhu in such Communities wishes to build a hut for his own use on monastery land, he need only get the approval of the abbot. Nothing in the ancient texts, however, supports this opinion.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》从《经分别》的讨论中进一步推断，获得场地批准的程序基本上涉及对无人认领的土地提出主张，因此不需要在僧团已经拥有土地的地方遵循，例如在寺院里；如果这样的僧团的比丘想在寺院土地上建造一间小屋供自己使用，他只需得到住持的批准即可。然而，古代文献中并没有任何内容支持这种观点。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Clearing the site</em>. Before notifying the local Community, the bhikkhu must get the site cleared—so says the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary adds that he should get it leveled as well. In both cases, he should arrange to have this done in such a way that does not violate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">Pc 10</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc11">11</a>. If one is planning to build the hut on monastery grounds, the wise policy would be to obtain permission from the abbot before clearing the site. Again, the question arises as to whether <em>clearing the site</em> means cutting down the trees on the spot where one proposes building the hut. In the origin story to the following rule, Ven. Channa caused an uproar by cutting down a venerated tree on a site where he planned to build, which led the Buddha to formulate the rule that the Community must inspect and approve the site to prevent uproars of this sort. This suggests that <em>clearing the site</em> here means clearing the underbrush so that the presence or absence of termites, etc., can be clearly determined. Only after the Community has approved the site should the necessary trees be cut down.</td>
<td>——<em>清理场地</em>。在通知当地僧团之前，比丘必须清理该场地——《经分别》如是说，《义注》补充说他也应该把它夷为平地。在这两种情况下，他都应该以不违反<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">《波逸提》十</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc11">十一</a>的方式进行安排。如果计划在寺院场地上建造小屋，明智的做法是在清理场地之前获得住持的许可。再次出现的问题是，<em>清理场地</em>是否意味著砍伐提议建造小屋的地点的树木。在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0217a11">下一条戒条的起源故事</a> 中，阐陀尊者在他计划建造的地方砍倒了一棵受人尊敬的树木，引起了轩然大波，这导致佛陀制定了戒条，要求僧团必须检查并批准该地点，以防止此类骚乱。这表明这里的<em>清理场地</em>意味著清理灌木丛，以便可以清楚地确定白蚁等的存在与否。只有在僧团批准该地点后，才能砍伐必要的树木。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Getting the site inspected</em>. The bhikkhu then goes to the Community and formally asks them to inspect the site. (The Pali passages for this and the remaining formal requests and proclamations are in the Vibhaṅga.) If all the members of the Community are able to go and inspect the site, they should all go. If not, the Community should select some of its members to go and inspect the site in its stead. The Vibhaṅga says that these inspectors should know what does and does not constitute a disturbance and adequate space, and requires that they be chosen by a formal motion with one proclamation. The Commentary says that they may also be chosen by a simple announcement <em>(apalokana)</em>, but this opinion violates the principle set forth in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0052.html#Mv.IX.3.3">Mv.IX.3.3</a> that if a shorter form is used for a transaction requiring a longer form, the transaction is invalid. Thus the Commentary’s opinion here cannot stand.</td>
<td>——<em>检查场地</em>。然后，比丘前往僧团并正式要求他们检查场地。（关于这一点的巴利段落以及其余的正式请求和羯磨文<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a13">都在《经分别》中</a>。）如果僧团的所有成员都能够去检查该地点，他们都应该去。如果不能，僧团应选择一些成员代替其前往现场检查。《经分别》说，这些检查员应该知道什么构成干扰、什么不构成干扰以及合适的空间，并要求通过正式的一白和一羯磨（白二羯磨）来挑选他们。《义注》说，也可以透过简单的<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/a/apalokana/">求听</a> <em>（apalokana）</em>来挑选他们，但这种意见违反了<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_009#0411a01">《大品》.九.3.3</a>中规定的原则，即如果需要较长形式的羯磨使用较短的形式，则该羯磨无效。因此，《义注》的观点不能成立。</td>

<tr><td>The inspectors then visit the site. If they find any disturbances or see that the site has inadequate space, they should tell the bhikkhu not to build there.

</tr>
<tr><td>The wording of the training rule, though, suggests that building a hut without a sponsor, for one’s own use, on a site with disturbances and without adequate space would entail a saṅghādisesa; but the Sub-commentary says—without offering explanation—that to read the rule in this way is to misinterpret it. Because the penalty for a multiple saṅghādisesa is the same as that for a single one, there is only one case where this would make an appreciable difference: a hut of the proper size, built on an approved site that has disturbances or does not have adequate space. This is a case of a Community transaction improperly performed: Either the bhikkhus inspecting the site were incompetent, or the disturbances were not immediately apparent. Because the usual penalty for improperly performing a Community transaction is a dukkaṭa (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0052.html#Mv.II.16.4">Mv.II.16.4</a>), this may be why the Vibhaṅga allots penalties as it does. As we noted in the Introduction, in cases where the Vibhaṅga is explaining the training rules that deal with Community transactions, it sometimes has to deviate from the wording of the rules to bring them in line with the general pattern for such transactions, a pattern that was apparently formulated after the rules and came to take precedence over them.</td>
<td>不过，学处的措辞表明，在没有资助者的情况下，在有干扰且没有合适空间的场所建造自用的小屋犯一次《僧残》；但《复注》说——没有提供解释——以这种方式解读本戒条是对它的误解。由于对多次《僧残》的惩罚与对单次《僧残》的惩罚相同，因此只有一种情况会产生明显的区别：一间大小合适的小屋，建在经批准的场地上，但有干扰或没有合适的空间。这是一个僧团羯磨执行不当的案例：要么是检查现场的比丘无能，要么是干扰没有立即显现出来。因为不当执行僧团羯磨的通常惩罚是《突吉罗》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0151a11">《大品》.二.16.4</a>），这可能是《经分别》如此分配惩罚的原因。正如我们在<strong>引言</strong>中指出的，在《经分别》解释处理僧团羯磨的学处的情况下，有时必须偏离戒条的措辞，以使它们符合此类羯磨的一般模式，这种模式显然是在戒条之后制定的，并且优先于戒条。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Usually, if a Community transaction has been improperly performed, it is invalid and unfit to stand even if the bhikkhus involved think that they are following the proper procedure. In other words, in the case just mentioned, the site would strictly speaking not count as approved, and the hut would involve a saṅghādisesa. However, the Vibhaṅga seems to be making a special exemption here in assigning only a dukkaṭa, perhaps so as not to punish unduly a bhikkhu who went to all the trouble to follow, as best he and his fellow bhikkhus knew how, the proper procedures prior to building his hut.</td>
<td>通常，如果僧团羯磨执行不当，即使相关比丘认为自己遵循了正确的程序，该羯磨也是无效且不适合成立的。换句话说，在刚才提到的情况下，严格来说，该地点不算被批准，而小屋将涉及《僧残》。然而，《经分别》似乎在这里做出了特殊的豁免，只指定了《突吉罗》，也许是为了不过度惩罚比丘，因为他和他的比丘同侪们都知道如何不辞辛劳地遵循建造小屋之前的正确程序。</td>

<td>如果在小屋尚未完工时，他回到场地，发现他忽略提及的规定遭到违反，他必须要么将小屋拆掉（《义注》说是夷为平地），按规定重建它，交给另一个比丘或僧团，要不然当小屋完成时，就因他忽略提及和建造者违反的每一项规定而面临全额惩罚。</td>

As for the standard measurement, they are not bound by it as they are building the hut for another’s use.</td>

<td><strong>乞讨</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to this rule does not go into any great detail on the issue of begging for construction materials. However, the Commentary contains a long discussion of what a bhikkhu may and may not beg for when building any kind of building, even those not covered by this rule. Because the Commentary’s discussion here is not based on the Canon, not all Communities regard these points as binding. Still, many of its suggestions merit serious consideration. Its main points are these:</td>
<td>本戒条的《经分别》并没有详细讨论乞讨建筑材料的问题。然而，《义注》包含了关于比丘在建造任何类型的建筑物时可以乞讨什么和不可以乞讨什么的长篇讨论，即使是那些不在本戒条范围内的建筑物。由于此处《义注》的讨论并非基于《圣典》，因此并非所有僧团都认为这些要点具有约束力。尽管如此，其中的许多建议仍值得认真考虑。其要点如下：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>A bhikkhu may ask for people to give labor in any situation (although this point seems to conflict with the spirit of the origin story to this rule). Thus he may ask stone masons to carry stone posts to his construction site, or carpenters to carry boards there. If, after he has asked them to help with the labor, they volunteer to donate the materials as well, he may accept them without penalty. Otherwise, he has to reimburse them for the materials.</td>
<td>比丘在任何情况下都可以要求人们给予劳力（尽管这一点似乎与本戒条的起源故事的精神相冲突）。因此，他可以请石匠将石柱搬到他的建筑工地，或请木匠将木板搬到那里。如果他要求他们帮忙做工后，他们也自愿捐赠材料，他可以接受，不受惩罚。否则的话，他就得给他们补偿材料费。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for tools, vehicles, and other things he will use in the process of construction, he may ask only to borrow them from other people and may not ask for them outright (except when asking from relatives or those who have made an offer). If the tools get damaged, he is responsible for getting them repaired before returning them to the owner. (This opinion, however, seems based on the Commentary’s concept of bhaṇḍadeyya, which we have already rejected under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>.) The only things he needn’t return to the owner are light articles <em>(lahubhaṇḍa)</em>, which the Sub-commentary identifies as things like reeds, rushes, grass, and clay—i.e., things having little or no monetary value at all.</td>
<td>对于施工过程中使用的工具、车辆等物品，只能向他人借用，不得直接索取（向亲戚或提出邀请者索取的除外）。如果工具损坏，他有责任修理好，然后再归还给所有者。（然而，这个观点似乎是基于《义注》的 bhaṇḍadeyya 概念，我们已经在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr2">《波罗夷》二</a>中拒绝了这个概念。）他唯一不需要归还给所有者的东西是轻物品<em>（lahubhaṇḍa）</em>，《复注》将其定为像芦苇、灯芯草、草和黏土这样的东西，即几乎没有或根本没有货币价值的东西。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This means that unless a bhikkhu is going to build his dwelling out of reeds, etc., or out of thrown-away scraps, he may not ask people in general for any of the materials that will actually go into the dwelling. Keep in mind that these rules were made during a period when wilderness was still plentiful, and solid building materials such as timber and stones were free for the taking. At present, unless a bhikkhu has access to unclaimed wilderness of this sort, to unclaimed garbage, or has enough funds on deposit with his steward (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>) to cover the cost of materials, his only recourse if he wants a solid structure is either to rammed earth or to hinting.</td>
<td>这意味著，除非比丘要用芦苇等，或用废弃的废料来建造他的住所，否则他不能向一般人索取任何实际用于建造住所的材料。请记住，这些规则是在林野仍然充足、木材和石头等固体建筑材料可以免费取得的时期制定的。目前，除非比丘能够有权使用此类无人认领的荒野，无人认领的垃圾，或者在他的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA">净人</a>处存有足够的资金（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>）来支付材料费用，否则如果他想要一个坚固的结构，他唯一的办法就是要夯土，不然就要暗示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary notes that while hinting is not allowed with regard to food or cloth, it is allowed with regard to construction materials (although again, this point seems to conflict with the spirit of the origin story). One example it gives is asking, “Do you think this is a good place to build a hut? An ordination hall?” Another example is staking out a construction site in hope that someone will ask, “What are you planning to do here?” If people get the hint and offer the materials, the bhikkhu may accept them. If they don’t, he may not ask directly for any materials except the “light articles” mentioned above.</td>
<td>《义注》指出，虽然在食物或衣服方面不允许暗示，但在建筑材料方面却允许暗示（尽管这一点似乎与起源故事的精神相冲突）。它给出的一个例子是问：「你认为这是建造小屋的好地方吗？戒堂？」另一个例子是在一个建筑工地上立桩标出界线，希望有人会问：「你打算在这里做什么？」如果人们得到暗示并提供材料，比丘可以接受。如果没有，除了上述的「轻物品」之外，他不得直接要求任何材料。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>From this it should be obvious that even in cases not covered by this rule—i.e., the dwelling he is building doesn’t qualify as a “hut,” or he is building something for other people to use—a bhikkhu engaged in construction work should not be burdensome to the laity. This is an important point, as the Buddha illustrated in a story he told to the bhikkhus at Āḷavī. A certain bhikkhu had once come to him with a complaint, and he reports the conversation as follows:</td>
<td>由此可见，即使在本戒条未涵盖的情况下，即他正在建造的住处不符合「小屋」的资格，或者他正在建造供其他人使用时，从事建筑工作的比丘不应成为俗人的负担。这是很重要的一点，正如佛陀在他向 Āḷavī 的比丘们讲述故事中所说明的那样。有一次，有一位比丘来向他抱怨，他将谈话的内容记述如下：<!-- TODO FIXME: replace 地名 Āḷavī -->

A great flock of birds, after feeding all day in the marsh, goes to roost in the forest at nightfall. That is why I have come to see the Blessed One—because I am annoyed by the noise of that flock of birds.’</td>

In the third watch of the night make this announcement three times: “Listen to me, good birds. I want a feather from everyone roosting in this forest. Each of you give me one feather”…. (The bhikkhu did as he was told.) Then the flock of birds, thinking, ‘The bhikkhu asks for a feather, the bhikkhu wants a feather,’ left the forest. And after they were gone, they never again returned. Bhikkhus, begging is unpleasant, hinting is unpleasant even to these common animals—how much more so to human beings?”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>None of the texts define <em>sponsor</em> aside from the Vibhaṅga’s statement that the sponsor can be a man or a woman, a householder or one gone forth. The Pali term for “sponsor” here, <em>sāmika</em>, can also mean “owner,” and this has led some to suggest that this rule covers only those cases where the donor maintains ownership over the dwelling even after the bhikkhu has finished it. This, however, would create a serious gap in the rules. Suppose a donor offers to provide all the materials for a bhikkhu to build himself a large hut and to hand ownership of the hut over to the bhikkhu when it is finished as well. This is an extremely common case, and yet it would not be covered by the preceding rule, for that rule deals only with instances where the bhikkhu has to beg for his materials. If <em>sāmika</em> under this rule were confined to the restrictive sense of “owner” given above, the case would not be covered by this rule, either.</td>
<td>除了《经分别》陈述<em>资助者</em>可以是男人或女人、居士或出家人之外，没有任何文字定义资助者。这里的巴利语「资助者」一词， <em>sāmika</em> ，也可以指「所有者」，这导致一些人认为，本戒条只适用于那些即使在比丘完工后，施主仍保留住处所有权的情况。然而，这将在戒条中造成严重漏洞。假设一位布施者愿意为一位比丘提供所有材料，让他自己建造一座大小屋，并在完工后将小屋的所有权移交给比丘。这是一个极其常见的情况，但它不会被前面的戒条涵盖，因为该戒条只涉及比丘必须乞讨材料的情况。如果本戒条下的 <em>sāmika</em> 仅限于上述「所有者」的限制性含义，则该情况也不会受到本戒条的管辖。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is evidence in the Canon, though, that the word <em>sāmika</em> can have another meaning aside from “owner.” The non-offense clauses to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> use the word <em>sāmika</em> to describe a person who creates a robe-fund for a bhikkhu but does not retain ownership of the robe once it has been given to the bhikkhu, and it seems reasonable to use the word in the same sense under this rule as well. Thus a sponsor here would be anyone—man or woman, ordained or not—who underwrites the cost of building a hut in such a way that the bhikkhu does not have to beg for his materials. Thus if a bhikkhu building a hut for his own use draws entirely on funds deposited with his steward for all materials and labor, the case would come under this rule as well.</td>
<td>不过，《圣典》中有证据表明，除了「所有者」之外， <em>sāmika</em> 一词还可以有其他意义。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>的不犯条款使用 <em>sāmika</em> 一词来描述为比丘创建袈裟资金但一旦将袈裟交给比丘后并不保留其所有权的人，在本戒条下使用具有同样意义的该词似乎也是合理的。因此，这里的资助者可以是任何人——男人或女人，受具足戒与否——承担建造小屋费用的人，这样比丘就不必乞讨他的材料。因此，如果比丘建造一间小屋供自己使用，其所有材料和劳力都完全由其存放在<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA">净人</a>的资金支付，则该情况也将受此戒条管辖。</td>

<td>考虑到《义注》对<em>为自己而造</em>的定义，如果资助者保留了已完工小屋的所有权，则该情况将不属于本戒条的范围。如果资助者正在建造一所住处供给一位比丘，而该比丘没有以任何方式参与建造或令其被建造，则本戒条不适用。</td>

<tr><td>This is just the heart of the origin story to this rule, which is one of the longest and most controversial accounts in the Vinaya. After Mettiyā Bhikkhunī made her charge, the Buddha convened a meeting of the Saṅgha to question Ven. Dabba Mallaputta. The latter, who had attained arahantship at the age of seven, responded truthfully that he could not call to mind ever having indulged in sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when awake. The Buddha then told the Saṅgha to expel Mettiyā Bhikkhunī and to interrogate (§) her instigators, after which he returned to his quarters. When the bhikkhus had expelled her, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja told them, “Friends, don’t expel Mettiyā Bhikkhunī. She hasn’t done anything wrong. She was instigated by us, who were upset, dissatisfied, and wanted to see him fall.”</td>
<td>这只是本戒条起源故事的核心，也是戒律中最长、最具争议的记载之一。慈比丘尼提出指控后，佛陀召集僧伽会议质问沓婆摩罗子尊者。后者七岁时证得阿罗汉果，他如实回答说，即使在梦中，他也无法回忆起曾经沉迷于性交的经历，更不用说在醒时了。然后，佛陀吩咐僧团驱逐慈比丘尼，并审问（§）她的煽动者，然后他返回自己的住处。当比丘们驱逐她时，慈和地的弟子告诉他们：「朋友们，不要驱逐慈比丘尼。她没有做错任何事。她是被我们怂恿的，我们心烦意乱，不满，想看他退堕。」</td>

<tr><td>In the centuries after the Canon was composed, however, many people have criticized and complained more about the Buddha’s treatment of Mettiyā Bhikkhunī. According to the Commentary, her expulsion was one of the controversial points dividing the bhikkhus in the Abhayagiri Vihāra from those in the Mahāvihāra in the old Sri Lankan capital of Anurādhapura. Even modern scholars have objected to the Buddha’s treatment of Mettiyā Bhikkhunī and interpret this passage as a “monkish gloss,” as if the Buddha himself were not a monk, and the entire Canon not the work of monks and nuns. The Commentary maintains that the Buddha acted as he did because he knew if he treated her less harshly, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja would never have volunteered the information that they had put her up to making the charge in the first place, and the truth would never have come out. This would have led some people to remain secretly convinced of Ven. Dabba Mallaputta’s guilt and—because he was an arahant—would have been for their long-term detriment and harm.</td>
<td>然而，在《圣典》形成后的几个世纪里，许多人对佛陀对待慈比丘尼的方式提出了更多的批评和抱怨。根据《义注》，她的驱逐是在斯里兰卡旧首都<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E5%8A%AA%E6%8B%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%99%AE%E5%8B%92">阿努拉德普勒</a>的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%84%A1%E7%95%8F%E5%B1%B1%E5%AF%BA">无畏山寺</a>比丘与<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E5%8A%AA%E6%8B%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%99%AE%E5%8B%92%E5%A4%A7%E5%AF%BA">大寺</a>比丘之间分裂的争议点之一。甚至现代学者也反对佛陀对慈比丘尼的处理，并将这段经文解释为「僧人的注释」，仿佛佛陀本人不是僧人，整部《圣典》也不是僧人和尼姑的作品。《义注》认为，佛陀这样做是因为他知道，如果他对待她不那么严厉，慈和地的弟子就永远不会自愿提供他们一开始就让她提出指控的信息，事实永远不会出来。这会导致一些人仍然暗中相信沓婆摩罗子尊者的罪行——因为他是阿罗汉——会对他们造成长久的危害和伤害。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, what concerns us here is that at some point after this rule was formulated, the Buddha put the Saṅgha in charge of judging accusations of this sort and gave them a definite pattern to follow to ensure that their judgments would be as fair and accurate as possible. Because the Vibhaṅga and Commentary to this rule are based on this pattern, we will discuss the pattern first before dealing with the special case—unfounded charges—covered by this rule.</td>
<td>无论如何，我们在这里关心的是，在本戒条制定后的某个时刻，佛陀让僧团负责判断此类指控，并给了他们一个明确的模式可遵循，以确保他们的判断是尽可能地公平和正确。由于本戒条的《经分别》和《义注》都是基于此模式，因此我们将首先讨论该模式，然后再处理本戒条所涵盖的特殊情况——毫无根据的指控。</td>

Human nature being what it is, there are bound to be bhikkhus who neglect this responsibility, in which case the responsibility falls to the offender’s fellow bhikkhus who know of the matter to admonish him in private, if possible, or—if he is stubborn—to make a formal charge in a meeting of the Community.</td>

<tr><td>As for the other party, he may give leave, or not, depending on his assessment of the individual asking for leave, for it is possible that someone might ask for leave without any real grounds, simply to be abusive. (This interpretation follows the Burmese edition on the relevant passage, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>. In other editions, the same passage says that one is allowed to make another bhikkhu give leave after having assessed him. However, in the context of the allowance—some group-of-six bhikkhus ask leave of bhikkhus they know are pure—there seems no need to allow a bhikkhu to reflect on whether the person he plans to accuse might be pure. That is one of the accuser’s duties, as enforced by the present rule along with the following rule, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc76">Pc 76</a>, and another passage in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>. As for the case of asking leave of someone who might prove abusive, that is already covered in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.2</a>, which says that even after another bhikkhu has given leave, one should assess him before leveling a charge against him. Thus, in context, the Burmese reading makes more sense: Having been asked to give leave, one is allowed to assess the person making the request before giving him leave to speak. If we did not follow the Burmese reading here, there would be no allowance in the Vibhaṅga or the Khandhakas not to give leave to an abusive accuser.) A bhikkhu who asks for leave with no grounds—i.e., he has not seen the other party commit the offense, has heard no reliable report to that effect, and has no reason to suspect anything to that effect—incurs a dukkaṭa (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>).</td>

<tr><td>The definition of this factor—the other bhikkhu is regarded as ordained—may sound strange, but it comes from the K/Commentary, which apparently extended the principle expressed in the factor of perception, explained below, that if one perceives the bhikkhu as innocent of the charge one is making, the fact of whether he is actually innocent is irrelevant to the offense under this rule. In the same way, the K/Commentary seems to be reasoning, if one perceives the bhikkhu to be a bhikkhu, the fact of whether he is actually a bhikkhu is irrelevant to this offense. The K/Commentary makes this point for a reason: In normal cases the object of this rule will be an innocent bhikkhu, but there may be cases where a bhikkhu has actually committed a pārājika offense that no one knows about; instead of disrobing, he acts as if he were still a bhikkhu, and everyone else assumes that he still is. Yet even a “bhikkhu” of this sort would fulfill this factor as far as this rule is concerned.</td>
<td>这个因素的定义——另一位比丘被认为是受戒的——可能听起来很奇怪，但它来自K/《义注》，它显然扩展了感知因素中表达的原则，如下所述，如果认为被指控的比丘是无罪的，他是否实际上是无辜的这一事实与本戒条下的犯戒无关。同样地，K/《义注》似乎在推理，如果认为该比丘是一位比丘，那么他实际上是否是比丘这一事实与此罪行无关。K/《义注》提出这一点是有原因的：在正常情况下，本戒条的对象是无辜的比丘，但也可能有比丘实际上犯了无人知晓的《波罗夷》罪的情况；他没有还俗，而是表现得好像他仍然是比丘，而其他人都认为他仍然是比丘。然而，就本戒条而言，即使是这样的「比丘」也能满足这个因素。</td>

<td>例如，X比丘偷走了一些寺院资金，但没有人知道，他继续表现得像比丘一样。Y比丘后来对他怀恨在心，并毫无根据地指控他与一名寺院支持者发生性关系。尽管 X 并不是真正的比丘，但人们普遍认为他是比丘这一事实就意味著他满足了这一因素。</td>

To make an accusation based on the assumption or suspicion that the accused is <em>not</em> innocent entails no offense.</td>

<tr><td>The wording of the training rule suggests that this factor would have to be fulfilled by impulse—aversion—together with motive—desiring the other bhikkhu’s expulsion—but the Vibhaṅga consistently conflates these two sub-factors under motive. Thus all that is needed to fulfill this factor is the desire to see the other bhikkhu expelled. If one’s motive is simply to insult him, the Vibhaṅga says that one’s actions would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc2">Pc 2</a>. If one’s motive is both to see him expelled and to insult him, one incurs both a saṅghādisesa and a pācittiya. The texts do not explicitly mention this point, but it would appear that if one has a strange sense of humor and is making the false charge as a joke with no intention of being insulting or taken seriously, one’s actions would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>.</td>
<td>学处的措词表明，这个因素必须透过冲动（瞋恨）和动机（渴望驱逐另一位比丘）来满足，但《经分别》始终将这两个子因素合并在动机之下。因此，要满足这个因素，所需要的只是渴望看到另一位比丘被驱逐。如果动机只是为了侮辱他，《经分别》说，该行为算在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc2">《波逸提》二</a>之下。如果动机既是为了看到他被驱逐又是为了侮辱他，那么就会同时犯《僧残》和《波逸提》。文本中没有明确提及这一点，但似乎如果有一种奇怪的幽默感，并将虚假指控当作一个笑话，无意侮辱或认真对待，那么该行为算在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>之下。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Vibhaṅga, <em>confessing one’s aversion</em> simply means admitting that the charge was empty or false. Thus the level of malice impelling one’s desire to see the other bhikkhu expelled need not be severe: If one wants to see him expelled just for the fun of it, that would fulfill the factor of intention here.</td>
<td>根据《经分别》的说法，<em>承认自己的厌恶</em>仅仅意味著承认指控是空洞的或错误的。因此，促使希望看到另一位比丘被驱逐的恶意程度不必太严重：如果只是为了好玩而想看到他被驱逐，那就满足了这里的意图因素。</td>

<tr><td>The act covered by this rule is that of making an unfounded charge of a pārājika in the accused’s presence. Whether one makes the charge oneself or gets someone else to make it, the penalty is the same. If that “someone else” is a bhikkhu and knows the charge is unfounded, he too incurs the full penalty.</td>
<td>本戒条所涵盖的行为是在被告在场的情况下提出毫无根据的《波罗夷》罪的指控。无论是自己提出指控或委托他人提出指控，惩罚都是一样的。如果那个「他人」是比丘并且知道指控毫无根据，他也会受到全额惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines an <em>unfounded charge</em> as one having no basis in what has been seen, heard, or suspected. In other words, the accuser has not seen the accused committing the offense in question, nor has he heard anything reliable to that effect, nor is there anything in the accused’s behavior to give rise to any honest suspicion.</td>
<td>《经分别》将<em>毫无根据的指控</em>定义为没有根据所看到、听到或怀疑的事实的指控。换句话说，指控者没有看到被指控者犯下相关罪行，也没有听到任何可靠的讯息，被指控者的行为也没有任何值得怀疑的地方。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Seeing</em> and <em>hearing</em>, according to the Commentary, also include the powers of clairvoyance and clairaudience one may have developed through meditation. Thus if one charges X with having committed a pārājika offense on the basis of what one has seen clairvoyantly, this would not be an unfounded charge, although one should be careful to make clear from the very beginning what kind of seeing the charge is based on.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，<em>看到</em>和<em>听到</em>也包括透过禅修发展的天眼和天耳的能力。因此，如果根据自己的天眼所见而指控 X 犯《波罗夷》罪，那么这不是一项毫无根据的指控，尽管应该从一开始就小心地表达清楚该指控是基于哪种看到。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga adds that if there is some basis in fact, but one changes the status of the evidence, the penalty is the same. <em>Changing the status</em> means, e.g., saying that one saw something when in actuality one simply heard about it or suspected it, or that one saw it clearly when in actuality one saw it indistinctly.</td>
<td>《经分别》补充说，如果有一定的事实依据，但改变了证据的状态，惩罚是一样的。<em>改变状态</em>意味著，例如，说看到了某物，而实际上只是听说或怀疑它，或者说清楚地看到了它，而实际上是模糊地看到了它。</td>

<tr><td>An example from the Commentary: Bhikkhu X goes into a grove to relieve himself. Ms. Y goes into the same grove to get something there. One sees them leaving the grove at approximately the same time—which could count as grounds for suspicion—but one then accuses Bhikkhu X, saying that one actually saw him having sex with Ms. Y. This would count as an unfounded charge. Another example: In the dark of the night, one sees a man stealing something from the monastery storehouse. He looks vaguely like Bhikkhu Z, but one can’t be sure. Still, one firms up one’s accusation by saying that one definitely saw Z steal the item. Again, this would count as an unfounded charge.</td>
<td>《义注》中的例子：比丘 X 到小树林解手。 Y 女士进入同一个小树林去拿东西。看到他们大约在同一时间离开树林——这可以算作怀疑的理由——但随后指责比丘 X，说实际上看到他与 Y 女士发生性关系。这算是毫无根据的指控。又如：夜深人静时，见一人在寺库中偷东西。他看起来有点像 Z 比丘，但无法确定。尽管如此，还是证实了自己的指控，说确实看到了 Z 偷了这件物品。同样，这算是毫无根据的指控。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary states that for an unfounded charge to count under this rule, it must state explicitly (a) the precise act the accused supposedly committed (e.g., having sexual intercourse, getting a woman to have an abortion) or (b) that the accused is guilty of a pārājika, or (c) that the accused is no longer a true bhikkhu. If one simply says or does something that might imply that the accused is no longer a bhikkhu—e.g., refusing to show him respect in line with his seniority—that does not yet count as a charge.</td>
<td>《义注》指出，要根据本戒条提出毫无根据的指控，必须明确说明 (a) 被指控者据称犯下的具体行为（例如，发生性交、让妇女堕胎）或 (b) 被指控者犯有《波罗夷》罪，或 (c) 被指控者不再是真正的比丘。如果只是说或做了一些可能暗示被指控者不再是比丘的事情——例如，拒绝根据他的戒腊向他表示尊重——那还不算是一项指控。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds that charging a bhikkhu with having committed an equivalent or derived pārājika, as discussed in the conclusion to the preceding chapter, would fulfill this factor as well. For instance, if one makes an unfounded charge accusing Bhikkhu A of having killed his father before his ordination, that would constitute a full offense here. The Vibhaṅga makes no mention of these equivalent pārājikas under this rule, but the Great Standards can be used to justify their inclusion here.</td>
<td>《义注》补充说，指控比丘犯了同等或衍生的《波罗夷》罪（如上一章结论中所讨论的那样）也可以满足这一因素。例如，如果毫无根据地指控比丘 A 在受具足戒前杀害了他的父亲，那么这里就构成了完全违犯。《经分别》没有提及本戒条下的这些同等的《波罗夷》罪，但是《四大教示》可以用来证明它们包含在这里是合理的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>All of the charges given as examples in the Vibhaṅga are expressed directly to the accused—“I saw you commit a pārājika offense,” “I heard you commit a pārājika offense”—and the Commentary concludes from this that the full offense occurs only when one makes the charge in the accused’s presence, in line with the pattern for admonition discussed above. To make an unfounded charge behind the accused’s back, it states, incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《经分别》中作为例子给出的所有指控都是直接向被指控者表达的——「我看到你犯了《波罗夷》罪」，「我听说你犯了《波罗夷》罪」——《义注》由此得出结论，只有当被指控者在场的情况下提出指控时，才会构成完整违犯，这符合上述教诫的模式。它指出，在被指控者背后提出毫无根据的指控，犯《突吉罗》。</td>
