<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>这个术语的意思是「让僧团参与初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和后续 <em>(sesa)</em> 行为」。它源于这样一个事实，即僧团是最初要求违反此类戒条的比丘接受惩罚（ <em>mānatta</em> ，赎罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，别住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他没有正确执行，则随后重新施加惩罚，最终当他正确执行后解除惩罚。此处有十三个学处（训练戒条），前九个在违反时即犯《僧残》，最后四个只有在违反者作为僧伽羯磨的一部分被诃责三次之后才犯《僧残》。</td>

<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">尔时，施越尊者过著不满的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形体枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脉悉现。优陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。一见到他，就对他说：『友！施越！，你为什么形体枯瘦…筋脉悉现？难道你对梵行生活不满意？』</td>

So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「于是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……当不满生起，欲念侵袭心时，他就会用手攻击射出精液。然后没多久，他就变得很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。因此，他的朋友比丘们对他说：『以前，朋友施越，你形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。但现在的你很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。难道是你在吃药？』</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒条的大纲形式是最容易解释的戒条之一。然而，就其细节而言，它是最复杂的之一，不仅因为该主题是一个敏感问题，而且因为《义注》在对构成完整违犯的三个因素中的两个的解释中偏离了《经分别》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>这三个因素是结果、意图和努力：由于有意的努力而导致精液的排出。当这三个因素都存在时，该违犯就是《僧残》。如果最后两项——意图和努力——都存在，那么该违犯就是《偷兰遮》。任何单一因素或两个因素的任何其他组合——即没有做出肉体的努力的意图和结果，或没有意图的努力和结果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出结果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解释一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒条所涵盖的意图和努力类型时，有必要知道它们的目的是什么，也因为结果是《经分别》和《义注》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<td><strong>结果</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，精液有十种颜色，这种分类源自古印度医学的诊断实践，医生会检查男性患者的射精，以此作为诊断其健康状况的一种方式。在根据这十种颜色的精液提出了一长系列的轮子之后，《经分别》得出了一个简单的结论：精液的颜色和品质与犯戒无关。这表明，接受过输精管结扎手术的比丘仍然可以犯下这条戒条，因为他仍然可以在性高潮时排出进入精液的各种成分（仅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>尽管《经分别》补充说，当精液「从基底落下」时，精液就会被排出，但它并没有详细讨论这一点。关于这种情况在性刺激过程中何时发生，《义注》讨论了三种观点。尽管它的讨论是以当时所理解的射精生理学为框架的，但它的结论很明确：当「使整个身体摇晃时，它被释放并下降到尿道」时，精液从其基底移动—换句话说，在性高潮的时候。《义注》进一步解释说，精液在进入尿道时会从其基底落下，因为从那时起，该过程是不可逆转的。因此，如果性刺激的过程达到了这一点，即使在性高潮时试图透过捏住阴茎末端来阻止精液离开身体，结果因素也已经满足。一旦进入尿道，它就已经从基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否离开身体并不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>尽管一些《复注》的再注释提出了比《义注》更谨慎的观点，即当射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺产生少量透明碱性液体时，精液就被视为从其基底落下。《经分别》中没有任何内容可以证明《义注》是错误的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Intention</strong></td>
<td><strong>意图</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” The Commentary explains these terms as follows: <em>Having willed</em> means having willed, having planned, with the intention of enjoying bringing about an emission. <em>Having made the decision</em> means having summoned up a reckless mind state, “crushing” through the power of an attack. (These are the same terms it uses to explain the same phrase under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">Pc 61</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">Pc 77</a>. The meaning is that one is not simply toying with the idea. One has definitely made up one’s mind to overcome all hesitation by aggressively setting upon an action aimed at causing emission.) <em>Knowingly</em> means knowing that, “I am making an exertion”—which the Sub-commentary explains as knowing that, “I am making an exertion for the sake of an emission.” <em>Consciously</em> means being aware that one’s efforts are bringing about an emission of semen.</td>
<td>《经分别》将<em>故意</em>定义为「有意愿，明知地而且有意识地做出决定」。《义注》对这些术语的解释如下：<em>有意愿</em>，意思是已经愿意、已经计划、并且意图享受射精。<em>做出决定</em>，意思是唤起了不顾后果的精神状态，以攻击之力「碾碎」。（这些是它用来解释<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#pr3">《波罗夷》三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">《波逸提》六一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">《波逸提》七七</a>中相同措辞的相同术语。意思是，不仅玩弄这个想法。而是已经肯定地下定决心，克服所有犹豫，积极地采取旨在引起射精的行动。）<em>明知</em>意思是知道「我正在努力」——《复注》将其解释为知道「我正在为了射精而努力」。<em>有意识</em>意思是意识到自己的努力正在导致精液的排出。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of “having willed” is where it deviates from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of intention. The Vibhaṅga, throughout its analysis, expresses this factor simply as “aiming at causing an emission,” and it lists ten possible motives for wanting to bring the emission about:</td>

<tr><td>Each of these motives, the Vibhaṅga says, fulfills the factor of intention here. Thus for the Commentary to limit the question of “deliberate intention” strictly to the enjoyment of the act of bringing about an emission (numbers 2 and 10 in the Vibhaṅga’s list) has no basis in the Canon. This means that the factor of intention under this rule is defined by deliberateness and immediate aim—causing an emission of semen—regardless of impulse or motive.</td>
<td>《经分别》说，这些动机中的每一个都满足了这里的意图因素。因此，《义注》将「故意」问题严格限制为享受带来射精的行为（《经分别》列表中的第2和10号）在《圣典》中是没有根据的。这意味著本戒条下的意图因素是由故意和直接目标（导致精液排出）定义的，无论冲动或动机如何。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines four types of effort that fulfill this factor: A bhikkhu causes an emission making an effort (1) at an internal object, (2) at an external object, (3) at both an internal and an external object, or (4) by shaking his pelvis in the air. It then goes on to explain these terms: The internal object is one’s own living body. External objects can either be animate or inanimate objects. The third type of effort involves a combination of the first two, and the fourth covers cases when one makes one’s penis erect (“workable”) by making an effort in the air.</td>
<td>《经分别》定义了满足此因素的四种类型的努力：比丘造成射精借由努力于：（1）内在所缘，（2）外在所缘，（3）内在所缘和外在所缘，或（4）透过在空中摇动骨盆。然后它继续解释这些术语：内在所缘是一个人自己的生命体。外在所缘可以是有生命的或无生命的所缘。第三种类型的努力涉及前两种的组合，第四种涵盖了透过在空中努力使阴茎勃起（「可行」）的情况。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The extremely general nature of these definitions gives the impression that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga wanted them to cover every imaginable type of bodily effort aimed at arousing oneself sexually, and this impression is borne out by the wide variety of cases covered in the Vinīta-vatthu. They include, among others, a bhikkhu who squeezes his penis with his fist, one who rubs his penis with his thumb, one who rubs his penis against his bed, one who inserts his penis into sand, one who bathes against the current in a stream, one who rubs his preceptor’s back in the bathing room, one who gets an erection from the friction of his thighs and robes while walking along, one who has his belly heated in the bathing room, and one who stretches his body. In each of these cases, if the bhikkhu aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.</td>
<td>这些定义极其笼统的性质给人的印象是，《经分别》的编撰者希望它们涵盖所有可以想像到的旨在唤起性欲的身体努力类型，而这种印象在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中涵盖的各种案例中得到了证实。其中包括一位比丘用拳头挤压他的阴茎，一位比丘用拇指摩擦他的阴茎，一位比丘用床摩擦他的阴茎，一位将他的阴茎插入沙子中，一位<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a08">在水流中逆流沐浴</a>。一位是在浴房里摩擦戒师的背部，一位是走路时大腿和袈裟摩擦而勃起的，一位是在浴房里加热腹部的，一位是伸展身体的。在上述每一种情况下，如果比丘目的在于射精并成功，他就会犯《僧残》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu also includes a case in which a bhikkhu, desiring to cause an emission, orders a novice to take hold of his (the bhikkhu’s) penis. He gets his emission and a saṅghādisesa to boot, which shows that getting someone else to make the effort for one fulfills the factor of effort here. Under the factor of consent, below, we will discuss a similar case from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> which indicates that simply lying still while allowing someone else to bring one to an orgasm fulfills the factor of effort here as well.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the factor of effort, though, the Commentary adds an additional sub-factor: that the effort must be directed at one’s own penis. If this were so, then a bhikkhu who succeeded in causing an emission by stimulating any of the erogenous zones of his body aside from his penis would incur no penalty. The Commentary itself actually makes this point, and the Sub-commentary seconds it, although the V/Sub-commentary says that such a bhikkhu would incur a dukkaṭa—what it bases this opinion on, it doesn’t say: perhaps a misreading of the Case of the Sleeping Novice, which we will discuss below.</td>
<td>然而，在讨论努力因素时，《义注》增加了一个额外的子因素：努力必须针对自己的阴茎。如果是这样的话，那么比丘如果透过刺激身体上除阴茎以外的任何性感带而成功地导致射精，就不会受到惩罚。《义注》本身实际上提出了这一点，而《复注》也同意这一点，尽管V/《复注》说这样的比丘会犯《突吉罗》—它并没有说明此观点基于什么：也许是对<strong>睡眠沙弥案例</strong>的误读，我们将在下面讨论。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, the Commentary in adding this last factor runs up against a number of cases in the Vinīta-vatthu in which the effort does not involve the penis: the bhikkhu warming his belly, the bhikkhu rubbing his preceptor’s back, a bhikkhu having his thighs massaged, and others. The Commentary deals with these cases by rewriting them, stating in most cases that the effort somehow had to involve the penis. This in itself is questionable, but when the Commentary actually contradicts the Vinīta-vatthu in the case of the bhikkhu who warms his belly, saying that this sort of effort could not involve an offense at all, even if one aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, the commentators have moved beyond the realm of commenting into the realm of rewriting the rule.</td>
<td>无论如何，《义注》在添加这最后一个因素时遭遇到了《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的许多案例，其中努力不涉及阴茎：比丘温暖他的腹部，比丘摩擦他的戒师的背部，比丘让他的大腿被按摩，等等。《义注》透过改写来处理这些案例，指出在大多数情况下，努力必须以某种方式涉及阴茎。这本身是有问题的，但是当《义注》实际上与《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中比丘温暖腹部的案例相矛盾时，说这种努力根本不涉及犯戒，即使一个人的目的在于射精并成功，注释者已经超越了注释领域，进入了改写戒条的领域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As stated in the Introduction, we have to go on the assumption that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga knew the crucial factors of each offense well enough to know what is and is not an offense, and were careful enough to include all the relevant facts when describing the precedents in the Vinīta-vatthu in order to show how the Buddha arrived at his judgments. Because the Commentary’s position—adding the extra factor that the physical effort has to involve one’s own penis—directly contradicts the Vibhaṅga on this point, the extra factor cannot stand.</td>

<tr><td>The issue here is whose semen was emitted. Pali syntax, unlike English, doesn’t give us a clue, for there is no syntactical rule that the pronoun in one sentence should refer to the subject of the preceding sentence. There are many cases under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a> that follow the form, “A stone badly held by the bhikkhu standing above hit the bhikkhu standing below on the head. The bhikkhu died. He felt conscience-stricken.” In these cases it is obvious from the context within the story which bhikkhu died and which one felt conscience-stricken, while with the sleeping novice we have to look for the context in other parts of the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>这里的问题是谁的精液被排出了。巴利语法与英语不同，没有给我们任何线索，因为没有语法规则要求一个句子中的代名词应该指前一个句子的主词。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#pr3">《波罗夷》三</a>中有许多案例遵循这样的形式：「站在上面的比丘拙劣地握住一块石头，击中了站在下面的比丘的头部。比丘死了。他感到良心受到谴责。」在这些情况下，从故事的上下文中可以明显看出哪个比丘死了，哪个比丘感到良心受到打击，而对于睡眠的沙弥，我们必须在《经分别》的其他部分寻找上下文。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu was the one who emitted semen, then perhaps there is a contradiction in the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary is justified in saying that the effort must involve one’s penis, for otherwise the case would seem to fulfill the Vibhaṅga’s general definition for the factor of effort: The bhikkhu is making an effort at an outside body and has an emission. Following the general pattern of the rule, he would incur a saṅghādisesa if he intended emission, and no penalty at all if he didn’t. Yet—deviating from the standard pattern for the Vinīta-vatthu cases—the Buddha does not ask whether he aimed at emitting semen, and simply gives the bhikkhu a dukkaṭa, which suggests an inconsistency.</td>
<td>如果比丘是射出精液的人，那么《经分别》中也许存在矛盾，而《义注》说努力必须涉及自己的阴茎是合理的，否则这种情况似乎满足了《经分别》对努力因素的一般定义：比丘对对外部的身体施加努力并且射出精液。按照戒条的一般模式，如果他意图射精，就会犯《僧残》，如果他没有意图射精，则不会受到任何惩罚。然而，与《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例的标准模式不同的是，佛陀并没有问他是否旨在射精，而只是给了比丘《突吉罗》，这表明了不一致。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, the novice was the one who emitted, there is no inconsistency at all: The bhikkhu incurs his dukkaṭa for making lustful bodily contact with another man (see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, below), and the case is included here to show that the full offense under this rule concerns instances where one makes <em>oneself</em> emit semen, and not where one makes others emit. (Other than this case, there is nothing in the rule or the Vibhaṅga that expressly makes this point. The rule simply mentions bringing about the emission of semen, without explicitly mentioning whose. This would explain the bhikkhu’s uncertainty as to whether or not he had committed a saṅghādisesa.) And the reason there is no mention of whether or not the bhikkhu intended to emit semen is because—as it comes under another rule—it is irrelevant to the case.</td>
<td>然而，如果沙弥是射出精液的人，则根本没有矛盾：比丘因与另一个男人进行淫荡的身体接触而犯《突吉罗》（参见下面<a class="reference external" href="#sg2">《僧残》二</a>的讨论），这个案例被包括在这里，以显示本戒条下的完全违犯涉及一个人使<em>自己</em>射出精液的情况，而不是使他人射出精液的情况。（除了这个例子之外，戒条或《经分别》中没有任何内容明确说明这一点。戒条只是提到导致精液的排出，而没有明确提及是谁的。这可以解释比丘不确定自己是否犯《僧残》。）之所以没有提及比丘是否有意射精，是因为——它属于另一条戒条——与本案例无关。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, inasmuch as the second reading—the novice was the one who had an emission—does no violence to the rest of the Vibhaṅga, it seems to be the preferable one. If this was the case that led the commentators to add their extra factor, we can see that they misread it and that the Vibhaṅga’s original definition for the factor of effort still stands: Any bodily effort made at one’s own body, at another body or physical object, at both, or any effort made in the air—like shaking one’s pelvis or stretching one’s body—fulfills the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>因此，由于第二种读法——沙弥是射精的人——对《经分别》的其余部分没有冲突，所以它似乎是更好的读法。如果正是这种情况导致注释者添加他们的额外因素，我们可以看到他们误读了它，而《经分别》对努力因素的原始定义仍然有效：对自己的身体、对另一个身体或身体对象，或对两者皆是，还是在空中所做的任何努力——比如摇动一个人的骨盆或伸展一个人的身体——所做出的任何身体努力，都满足了这里的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One case that does <em>not</em> fulfill the factor of effort, according to the Vinīta-vatthu, is when one is filled with lust and stares at the private parts of a woman or girl. In the case dealing with this contingency, the bhikkhu emits semen, but again the Buddha does not ask whether he intended to. Instead, he lays down a separate rule, imposing a dukkaṭa for staring lustfully at a woman’s private parts. This suggests that efforts with one’s eyes do not count as bodily efforts under this saṅghādisesa rule, for otherwise the penalty would have been a saṅghādisesa if the bhikkhu had intended emission, and no offense—not a dukkaṭa—if he hadn’t. And this also suggests that the dukkaṭa under this separate rule holds regardless of intention or result. The Commentary adds that this dukkaṭa applies also to staring lustfully at the genitals of a female animal or at the area of a fully-clothed woman’s body where her sexual organ is, thinking, “Her sexual organ is there.” At present we would impose the penalty on a bhikkhu who stares lustfully at a woman’s private parts in a pornographic photograph.</td>
<td>根据《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，一种<em>不</em>满足努力因素的情况是，当一个人充满欲望并盯著女人或女孩的私处时。在处理这种可能发生的情况时，比丘射出精液，但佛陀并没有问他是否有意这样做。相反地，他制定了一条单独的戒条，对<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a02">充满欲望地凝视女性私处，处以《突吉罗》</a>。这表明，在本《僧残》戒条下，用眼睛做的努力不算作身体的努力，否则，如果比丘有意射精，就会受到《僧残》的惩罚；如果他没有无意，则没有犯戒，而不是《突吉罗》。这也表明，无论意图或结果如何，这条单独戒条下的《突吉罗》都成立。《义注》补充说，这种《突吉罗》也适用于充满欲望地凝视雌性动物的生殖器，或盯著穿著衣服的女性身体的性器官所在的区域，心想：「她的性器官就在那里。」目前，我们会对在色情照片中充满欲望地凝视女性私处的比丘施以此惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see under the non-offense clauses, there is no offense in a nocturnal emission. The Commentary, however, discusses the question of conscious efforts made prior to sleep aimed at a nocturnal emission, and arrives at the following verdicts: If a bhikkhu, “usurped” with lust while lying down, grabs his penis with his fist or thighs and drops off to sleep maintaining that position in hopes of inducing an emission, he incurs the full offense if the emission takes place. If, however, he suppresses his “lust-usurpation” by reflecting on the foulness of the body and then dozes off with a pure mind, he incurs no offense even if an emission later occurs. The analysis here seems to be that the bhikkhu’s change of mind would separate the emission from the earlier effort enough so that it would not be regarded as a direct result of that effort. The Sub-commentary adds that, in addition to suppressing the lust in his mind, he also has to discontinue his effort to be free of an offense in this way. And both texts have to be qualified by saying that the “no offense” would apply only to the emission, for the earlier intentional effort would incur a thullaccaya.</td>
<td>正如我们将在不犯条款中看到的，遗精并不构成犯戒。然而，《义注》讨论了在睡眠前为了遗精而有意识地努力的问题，并得出以下结论：如果比丘在躺下时被欲望「侵占」，用拳头或大腿抓住他的阴茎，入睡时保持该姿势以期引起遗精，如果发生遗精，他将完全违犯此戒条。然而，如果他透过反思身体的不净来抑制「欲望篡夺」，然后以清净的心入睡，即使后来发生遗精，他也不会犯戒。这里的分析似乎是，比丘改变心意，会将射精与先前的努力充分分开，这样它就不会被视为该努力的直接结果。《复注》又说，除了抑制内心的欲望之外，他还必须停止他的努力而免于以这种方式犯戒。这两篇文本都必须加以限定，即「不犯」仅适用于射精，因为更早之前的故意努力会犯《偷兰遮》。</td>

In both cases the bhikkhu lets her go ahead, and the Buddha says that he incurs a saṅghādisesa in doing so. The commentaries treat the cases as self-evident and offer no extra details. Thus, given the facts as we have them, it would seem that consent under this rule can be expressed physically simply by letting the act happen.

Otherwise, one would incur a thullaccaya simply for moving one’s legs. <em>Sensual fever</em>, here, probably refers to the desire to cause an emission, for there are several spots where the Commentary discusses bhikkhus who stimulate an erection simply for the enjoyment of the contact rather than to cause an emission, and the judgment is that they incur no penalty, even if an emission does inadvertently result.</td>
<td>在讨论一位大腿肥大的比丘，只要走路就勃起的案例时，《义注》提到，如果在这种情况下发现欲「烧」，必须立即停止行走，并开始观照身体的不净，以便在继续前进之前净化内心。否则，仅仅因为移动双腿就会招致《偷兰遮》。这里的<em>欲烧</em>可能是指想要引起射精的欲望，因为《义注》中有好几处讨论了比丘刺激勃起的原因，他们只是为了享受接触的乐趣而不是为了引起射精，而判决结果是，即使无意中造成了射精，他们也不会受到惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Aside from the thullaccaya, the Vibhaṅga assigns no other derived offenses under this rule. A bhikkhu who has an ejaculation while thinking sensual thoughts but without making any physical effort to cause it, incurs no penalty regardless of whether the idea crosses his mind that he would like to have an emission, and regardless of whether he enjoys it when it occurs. However, the Commentary notes here that even though there is no offense involved, one should not let oneself be overcome by sensual thoughts in this way. This point is borne out by the famous simile that occurred to Prince Siddhattha before his Awakening and that later, as Buddha, he related to a number of listeners:</td>
<td>除了《偷兰遮》之外，《经分别》在本戒条下没有指定任何其他衍生违犯。比丘在想性欲念头时射精，但没有付出任何身体努力来导致射精，无论他的心中是否有想要射精的念头，也无论当射精发生时他是否享受它，都不会受到惩罚。然而，《义注》在此指出，即使没有犯戒，也不应该这样让自己被欲念所征服。悉达多太子在成佛之前，后来成为佛陀时，对许多听众讲了一个著名的比喻，证实了这一点：</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes that some interpreters had taken the idiomatic term in the rule translated as, “while dreaming (<em>supinantā</em>),” and read it as a compound meaning literally “at the end of a dream (<em>supin’antā</em>),” thus opening an allowance for intentional effort and emission when awakening from a soon-to-be-wet dream. However, the Commentary goes on to rule out this overly literal interpretation, stating that what happens in the mind while one is sleeping falls in the bounds of the Abhidhamma, but what happens after one awakens falls within the bounds of the Vinaya; and that there is no such thing as a misdeed performed when one is in a “non-negligible” state of mind that does not count as an offense. (<em>Non-negligible</em>, according to the Sub-commentary, means “normal.”)</td>
<td>《义注》指出，一些解释者将戒条中的惯用术语翻译为「做梦时 (<em>supinantā</em>)」，并将其解读为复合词，字面意思是「在梦的结尾 (<em>supin'antā</em>)」，从而开缘了当从即将遗精的春梦中醒来时，允许有意识的努力和泄精。然而，《义注》接著排除了这种过于字面的解释，指出睡著时内心发生的事情属于阿毘达摩的范围，而睡醒后发生的事情则属于戒律的范围。当一个人处于「不可忽略」的心态时，任何不端行为都算犯戒。（根据《复注》，<em>不可忽略</em>的意思是「正常」。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In making the exception for what happens while asleep, the Buddha states that even though there may be the intention to cause an emission, it doesn’t count. The Commentary goes on to say, however, that if a bhikkhu fully awakens in the course of a wet dream, he should lie still and be extremely careful not to make a move that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. If the process has reached the point where it is irreversible and the ejaculation occurs spontaneously, he incurs no penalty regardless of whether he enjoys it. And as the Commentary quotes from the Kurundī, one of the ancient Sinhalese commentaries on which it is based, if he wakes up in the course of a wet dream and grabs hold of his penis to prevent the ejaculation from soiling his robes or bedding, there is no offense.</td>
<td>在对睡眠时发生的情况进行例外处理时，佛陀指出，即使可能有导致泄精的意图，但这不算数。然而，《义注》接著说，如果比丘在春梦中完全醒来，他应该静静地躺著，并且要非常小心，不要做出会满足本戒条下努力因素的举动。如果这个过程已经达到不可逆转的地步并且射精自然发生，那么无论他是否享受它，他都不会受到惩罚。正如《义注》引用的《Kurundī》（这是其所依据的古代僧伽罗注释之一）中的那样，如果他在春梦中醒来并抓住他的阴茎以防止射精弄脏他的袈裟或床上用品，那么并没有犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>However, the Commentary’s two cases concerning nocturnal emissions, mentioned above, indicate that if a nocturnal emission occurs after a bhikkhu made a fully intentional effort toward an emission before falling asleep, he would incur the full offense under this rule unless the effort and intent were clearly stopped with a clear change of heart while he was still awake. This is because all three factors under this rule would be fully present: a conscious, unhesitating decision to cause an emission; a conscious effort based on that decision; and the resulting emission. Whether or not one was conscious while it occurred is of no account.</td>
<td>然而，上述《义注》中关于遗精的两个案例表明，如果比丘在入睡前完全有意地努力泄精，之后发生遗精，那么他将完全违犯本戒条下，除非在他还醒著的时候，由于心意的明显改变而明显地停止了努力和意图。这是因为本戒条下的所有三个因素都将完全存在：有意识地、毫不犹豫地决定引起泄精；基于该决定的有意识的努力；以及由此产生的泄精。事情发生时一个人是否有意识并不重要。</td>
