<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>这个术语的意思是「让僧团参与初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和后续 <em>(sesa)</em> 行为」。它源于这样一个事实，即僧团是最初要求违反此类戒条的比丘接受惩罚（ <em>mānatta</em> ，赎罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，别住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他没有正确执行，则随后重新施加惩罚，最终当他正确执行后解除惩罚。此处有十三个学处（训练戒条），前九个在违反时即犯《僧残》，最后四个只有在违反者作为僧伽羯磨的一部分被诃责三次之后才犯《僧残》。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">尔时，施越尊者过著不满的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形体枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脉悉现。优陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。一见到他，就对他说：『友！施越！，你为什么形体枯瘦…筋脉悉现？难道你对梵行生活不满意？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘Yes, friend.’</td>
<td>「『是的，朋友。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘In that case, eat as you like and sleep as you like and bathe as you like; and having eaten, slept, and bathed as you like, when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails the mind, emit semen having attacked (!) with your hand.’</td>
<td>「『既然如此，想吃就吃，想睡就睡，想沐浴就沐浴；随心所欲地饮食、睡眠、沐浴，当不满生起、欲念侵袭心时，就用手攻击（！）射出精液。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘But is it okay to do that?’</td>
<td>「『但是这样做可以吗？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘Of course. I do it myself.’</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>“So then Ven. Seyyasaka ate as he liked and slept as he liked… and when dissatisfaction arose and lust assailed his mind, he would emit semen having attacked with his hand. Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「于是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……当不满生起，欲念侵袭心时，他就会用手攻击射出精液。然后没多久，他就变得很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。因此，他的朋友比丘们对他说：『以前，朋友施越，你形体枯瘦……筋脉悉现。但现在的你很有魅力，五官圆润，容貌光泽。难道是你在吃药？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘No, I’m not taking medicine, my friends. I just eat as I like and sleep as I like… and when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails my mind, I emit semen having attacked with my hand.’</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒条的大纲形式是最容易解释的戒条之一。然而，就其细节而言，它是最复杂的之一，不仅因为该主题是一个敏感问题，而且因为《义注》在对构成完整违犯的三个因素中的两个的解释中偏离了《经分别》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>这三个因素是结果、意图和努力：由于有意的努力而导致精液的排出。当这三个因素都存在时，该违犯就是《僧残》。如果最后两项——意图和努力——都存在，那么该违犯就是《偷兰遮》。任何单一因素或两个因素的任何其他组合——即没有做出肉体的努力的意图和结果，或没有意图的努力和结果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出结果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解释一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒条所涵盖的意图和努力类型时，有必要知道它们的目的是什么，也因为结果是《经分别》和《义注》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<td><strong>结果</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，精液有十种颜色，这种分类源自古印度医学的诊断实践，医生会检查男性患者的射精，以此作为诊断其健康状况的一种方式。在根据这十种颜色的精液提出了一长系列的轮子之后，《经分别》得出了一个简单的结论：精液的颜色和品质与犯戒无关。这表明，接受过输精管结扎手术的比丘仍然可以犯下这条戒条，因为他仍然可以在性高潮时排出进入精液的各种成分（仅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>尽管《经分别》补充说，当精液「从基底落下」时，精液就会被排出，但它并没有详细讨论这一点。关于这种情况在性刺激过程中何时发生，《义注》讨论了三种观点。尽管它的讨论是以当时所理解的射精生理学为框架的，但它的结论很明确：当「使整个身体摇晃时，它被释放并下降到尿道」时，精液从其基底移动—换句话说，在性高潮的时候。《义注》进一步解释说，精液在进入尿道时会从其基底落下，因为从那时起，该过程是不可逆转的。因此，如果性刺激的过程达到了这一点，即使在性高潮时试图透过捏住阴茎末端来阻止精液离开身体，结果因素也已经满足。一旦进入尿道，它就已经从基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否离开身体并不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>尽管一些《复注》的再注释提出了比《义注》更谨慎的观点，即当射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺产生少量透明碱性液体时，精液就被视为从其基底落下。《经分别》中没有任何内容可以证明《义注》是错误的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Intention</strong></td>
<td><strong>意图</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” The Commentary explains these terms as follows: <em>Having willed</em> means having willed, having planned, with the intention of enjoying bringing about an emission. <em>Having made the decision</em> means having summoned up a reckless mind state, “crushing” through the power of an attack. (These are the same terms it uses to explain the same phrase under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">Pc 61</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">Pc 77</a>. The meaning is that one is not simply toying with the idea. One has definitely made up one’s mind to overcome all hesitation by aggressively setting upon an action aimed at causing emission.) <em>Knowingly</em> means knowing that, “I am making an exertion”—which the Sub-commentary explains as knowing that, “I am making an exertion for the sake of an emission.” <em>Consciously</em> means being aware that one’s efforts are bringing about an emission of semen.</td>
<td>《经分别》将<em>故意</em>定义为「有意愿，明知地而且有意识地做出决定」。《义注》对这些术语的解释如下：<em>有意愿</em>，意思是已经愿意、已经计划、并且意图享受射精。<em>做出决定</em>，意思是唤起了不顾后果的精神状态，以攻击之力「碾碎」。（这些是它用来解释<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#pr3">《波罗夷》三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">《波逸提》六一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">《波逸提》七七</a>中相同措辞的相同术语。意思是，不仅玩弄这个想法。而是已经肯定地下定决心，克服所有犹豫，积极地采取旨在引起射精的行动。）<em>明知</em>意思是知道「我正在努力」——《复注》将其解释为知道「我正在为了射精而努力」。<em>有意识</em>意思是意识到自己的努力正在导致精液的排出。</td>
