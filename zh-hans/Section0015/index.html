<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga contains a discussion of three proper sizes for a bowl—the medium size containing twice the volume of the small, and the large twice the volume of the medium—but they are based on measurements that are not known with any precision at present. The author of the Vinaya-mukha reports having experimented with various sizes of bowls based on a passage in the story of Meṇḍaka in the Dhammapada Commentary. His conclusion: A small bowl is just a little larger than a human skull, and a medium bowl approximately 27 1/2 English inches (70 cm.) in circumference, or about 8.75 inches (22.5 cm.) in diameter. He did not try making a large bowl. Any size larger than the large size or smaller than the small is inappropriate; any size between them falls under this rule.</td>
<td>《经分别》讨论了钵的三种适当尺寸——中号钵的体积是小号钵的两倍，大号钵的体积是中号钵的两倍——但它们所基于的测量结果目前还没有已知的任何精确度。《戒律入口》的作者报告说，他根据《法句经》《义注》中 Meṇḍaka 故事的一个段落，尝试了各种尺寸的钵。他的结论是：小钵只比人的头骨大一点，中钵的周长约为 27 又 1/2 英寸（70 公分），直径约为 8.75 英寸（22.5 公分）。他没有尝试做一个大钵。任何大于大号或小于小号的尺寸都是不合适的；它们之间的任何大小都属于符合本戒条。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to the following rule says that a bhikkhu may ask for a new bowl if his current bowl has five mends or more, the space for a mend (§) being two inches (fingerbreadths). The Commentary explains this first by saying that a bowl with five mends or more is damaged beyond repair, and thus loses its determination as a bowl. It then expands on the Vibhaṅga’s statements as follows: A clay bowl is damaged beyond repair if it has at least ten inches of cracks in it, the smallest of the cracks being at least two inches long. Cracks less than two inches long are said not to merit mending—this is the meaning of the Vibhaṅga’s phrase, “space for a mend”—and so do not count. As the K/Commentary notes, whether the cracks are actually mended is not an issue here. If a bowl has fewer cracks than that, they should be mended either with tin wire, sap (but for some reason not pure pine sap), or a mixture of sugar cane syrup and powdered stone. Other materials not to be used for repair are beeswax and sealing wax. If the total length of countable cracks equals ten inches or more, the bowl becomes a non-bowl, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one.</td>
<td>下一条戒条的《经分别》指出，如果比丘目前的钵有五处修补或更多，则比丘可以要求一个新钵，而修补的空间（§）为两英寸（指宽）。《义注》首先解释说，钵修补五次以上，就已经损坏到无法修复的程度，从而失去了其决意为钵。然后，它对《经分别》的叙述进行了如下扩展：如果一个粘土钵（陶钵）上有至少十英寸的裂缝，其中最小的裂缝至少有两英寸长，那么它就被损坏到无法修复的程度。小于两英寸长的裂缝据说不值得修补——这就是《经分别》的措辞「用来修补的空间」的含义——所以不算数。正如 K/《义注》所指出的，裂缝是否真正得到修补在此并不是问题。如果钵的裂缝比那少，则应使用锡丝、树液（但由于某种原因不是纯松树液）或甘蔗糖浆和石粉的混合物来修补。其他不能用于修复的材料是蜂蜡和密封蜡。如果可数裂缝的总长度等于或超过十英寸，则该钵就不再是钵，主人有权要求换一个新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for iron and steel bowls, a hole in the bowl large enough to let a millet grain pass through is enough to make the determination lapse, but not enough to make the bowl a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should plug the hole—or have a blacksmith plug it—with powdered metal or a tiny metal plug polished smooth with the surface of the bowl and then re-determine the bowl for use.</td>
<td>对于铁钵、不锈钢钵来说，钵上有一个足以让一粒小米粒通过的孔，足以使决意失效，但不足以使该钵成为非钵。比丘应该用金属粉末或与钵表面打磨光滑的小金属塞塞住这个洞，或者请铁匠塞住，然后重新决意钵来使用。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the hole is small enough to be plugged in this way, then no matter how many such holes there are in the bowl they do not make it a non-bowl. The bhikkhu should mend it and continue using it. If, however, there is even one hole so large that the metal used to plug it cannot be polished smooth with the surface of the rest of the bowl, the tiny crevices in the patch will collect food. This makes it unfit for use, and the owner is entitled to ask for a new one to replace it.</td>
<td>如果这个洞够小，可以用这种方式堵住，那么无论钵里有多少个这样的洞，都不会使它成为一个非钵。比丘应该修补它并继续使用它。然而，即使只有一个孔太大，以至于用于堵塞它的金属无法与钵其余部分的表面抛光光滑，修补片上的微小缝隙就会积聚食物。这将导致其不适合使用，所有者有权要求更换新的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>An extra alms bowl, according to the Vibhaṅga, is any that has not yet been determined for use or placed under shared ownership. Because a bhikkhu may have only one bowl determined for use at any one time, he should place any additional bowls he receives under shared ownership if he plans to keep them on hand. (The procedures for placing bowls under determination and shared ownership, and for rescinding their determination and shared ownership, are given in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">Appendices IV</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">V</a>.)</td>
<td>根据《经分别》，额外的钵是指尚未决意使用或置于共享所有权之下的任何钵。因为比丘在任何时候只可以有一个钵决意使用，所以如果他打算将收到的任何额外的钵放在手边，他应该将它们置于共享所有权之下。（将钵决意和置于共享所有权之下以及撤销其决意和共享所有权的程序参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixIV">附录四</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0028.html#appendixV">五</a>。）</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, once a bowl belonging to a bhikkhu fulfills all the requirements for a determinable bowl, he is responsible for it even if he has not yet received it into his keeping—in other words, the countdown on the time span begins. For example, if a blacksmith promises to make him a bowl and to send word when it is finished, the bhikkhu is responsible for the bowl as soon as he hears word from the blacksmith’s messenger that the bowl is ready, even if he has yet to receive it. If the blacksmith, prior to making the bowl, promises to send it when it is done, then the bhikkhu is not responsible for it until the blacksmith’s messenger brings it to him. (All of this assumes that the bowl is already fully paid for.)</td>
<td>根据《义注》，一旦比丘拥有的钵满足了可决意钵的所有要求，即使他还没有收到它，他也要对它负责——换句话说，时间跨度开始倒数。例如，如果铁匠答应为他制作一个钵，并在完成后通知他，一旦比丘听到铁匠的使者说钵已准备好，他就要对钵负责，即使他还没有收到它。如果铁匠在制作钵之前承诺完成后将其送出，那么在铁匠的使者将钵带给比丘之前，比丘不对此负责。（所有这些都假设钵已经全额付款。）</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if within ten days after receiving a new bowl a bhikkhu does not determine it for use, place it under shared ownership, abandon it (give it or throw it away); and if the bowl is not lost, snatched away, damaged beyond repair, or taken on trust, then on the tenth dawnrise after receiving it he incurs the full penalty under this rule. If he then uses the bowl without having forfeited it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《经分别》规定，如果比丘在收到新钵后十天内不决意它来使用，置于共享所有权之下，放弃它（给予或扔掉）；而且如果钵没有遗失、被抢走、损坏到无法修复或被基于信任拿走，那么在收到钵后的第十天黎明时，根据本戒条他将承担全部惩罚。如果他随后使用了钵而没有舍出它，则惩罚是《突吉罗》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Perception is not a mitigating factor here. Even if the bhikkhu thinks that ten days have not passed when they have, or if he thinks that the bowl is damaged beyond repair or placed under shared ownership, etc., when it isn’t, he incurs the penalty all the same.</td>
<td>在这里，感知并不是减轻惩罚的因素。即使比丘认为十天还没过，但实际上已经过十天了，或认为钵已损坏无法修复或置于共享所有权之下，但事实并非如此，他仍然会受到惩罚。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga also states that, in the case of an extra bowl that has not been kept more than ten days, if one perceives it to have been kept more than ten days or if one is in doubt about it, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.

As with all Community officials, the bowl exchanger must be free of the four types of bias: based on desire, based on aversion, based on delusion, based on fear. He must also know when a bowl is properly exchanged and when it’s not. His duty, once authorized, is to take the forfeited bowl and show it to the most senior bhikkhu, who is to choose whichever of the two bowls pleases him more—his own or the new one. If the new bowl is preferable to his own and yet he does not take it out of sympathy for the offender, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The K/Commentary and Sub-commentary add that if he does not prefer the new bowl, there is no offense in not taking it. The Commentary states that if he does prefer the new bowl but, out of a desire to develop the virtue of contentment with what he has, decides not to take it, there is also no offense.</td>

<tr><td><em>Fresh butter</em> must be made from the milk of any animal whose flesh is allowable. None of the Vinaya texts go into detail on how fresh butter is made, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN126.html">MN 126</a> describes the process as “having sprinkled curds in a pot, one twirls them with a churn.” Fresh butter of this sort is still made in India today by taking a small churn—looking like an orange with alternate sections removed, attached to a small stick—and twirling it in curds, all the while sprinkling them with water. The fresh butter—mostly milk fat—coagulates on the churn, and when the fresh butter is removed, what is left in the pot is diluted buttermilk. Fresh butter, unlike creamery butter made by churning cream, may be stored unrefrigerated in bottles for several days even in the heat of India without going rancid.</td>

Apparently, cheese—curds heated to evaporate their liquid content and then cured with or without mold—was unknown in those days, but there seems every reason, using the Great Standards, to include it under one of the five. The question is which one. Some have argued that it should come under fresh butter, but the argument for classifying it under curds seems stronger, as it is closer to curds in composition and is generally regarded as more of a substantial food.

The Commentary also says that sugar or molasses made from any fruit classed as a food—such as coconut or date palm—ranks as a food and not as a tonic, but it is hard to guess at its reasoning here, as sugar cane itself is also classed as a food. The Vinaya-mukha seems more correct in using the Great Standards to say that all forms of sugar and molasses, no matter what the source, would be included here. Thus maple syrup and beet-sugar would come under this rule.</td>

2) Unlike the other rules dealing with robe-cloth or bowls kept <em>x</em> number of days, the non-offense clauses here do not include exemptions for tonics placed under shared ownership, but the Commentary discusses <em>abandons it</em> as if it read “places it under shared ownership.” Its verdict: Any tonic placed under shared ownership may be kept for more than seven days without incurring a penalty as long as the owners do not divide up their shares, but after the seventh day they may not use it for internal purposes. The Sub-commentary adds that any tonic placed under shared ownership may not be used at all until the arrangement is rescinded.</div>

Mahā Sumanatthera states that the phrase, “if within seven days” applies here as well: If within seven days the bhikkhu gives the tonic to an unordained person, having abandoned possession of it in his mind, he may then keep it and consume it for another seven days if the unordained person happens to return it to him.</div>

3）《义注》记述了两位戒律专家之间关于列表中最后一项豁免的含义的争议，即「将它给予未受具足戒的人，在心中放弃了对它的拥有，他收到它作为回报并使用它」。摩诃Sumanatthera尊者指出，该措辞「若在七日内」也适用于此：如果在七日内，比丘将补品给予一位未受具足戒的人，并在心中放弃了对它的拥有，如果未受具足戒的人碰巧将其归还给他，那么他可以保留它并继续食用七天。</div>

<tr><td>Ven. Mahā Padumatthera disagrees, saying that the exemption <em>abandons it</em> already covers such a case, and that the exemption here refers to the situation where a bhikkhu has kept a tonic past seven days, has forfeited it and received it in return, and then gives it up to an unordained person. If the unordained person then returns the tonic to him, he may use it to rub on his body.</td>
<td>摩诃Padumatthera尊者不同意，他说，<em>放弃它</em>的豁免已经涵盖了这种情况，这里的豁免是指比丘保留补品超过七天，已经舍出并收到它作为回报，然后给予一位未受具足戒的人的情况。如果未受具足戒者随后将补品归还给他，他可以用它来涂抹身体。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary agrees with the latter position, but this creates some problems, both textual and practical. To begin with, the phrase, “if within seven days,” modifies every one of the other non-offense clauses under this rule, and there is nothing to indicate that it does not modify this one, too. Second, every one of the other exemptions refers directly to ways of avoiding the full offense and not to ways of dealing with the forfeited article after it is returned, and again there is nothing to indicate that the last exemption breaks this pattern.</td>
<td>K/《义注》同意后一种观点，但这造成了一些问题，包括文字和实际问题。首先，「如果在七天之内」这句话修改了本戒条下的所有其他不犯条款，并且没有任何迹象表明它不会修改这条。其次，其他每项豁免都直接提到了避免完全违犯的方式，而不是提到归还舍出物品后的处理方式，而且没有任何迹象表明最后一项豁免打破了这种模式。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>On the practical side, if the exemption <em>abandons it</em> covers cases where a bhikkhu may give up the tonic to anyone at all and then receive it in return to use for another seven days, bhikkhus could spend their time trading hoards of tonics among themselves indefinitely, and the rule would become meaningless. But as the origin story shows, it was precisely to prevent them from amassing such hoards that the rule was formulated in the first place.</td>
<td>从实际角度来看，如果<em>放弃它</em>的豁免涵盖了比丘可以将补品给予任何人，然后再收到补药以供使用七天的情况，比丘们可以无限期地花时间在他们之间交易补品，那么本戒条就变得毫无意义了。但正如<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0354a14">起源故事</a>所示，最初制定本戒条正是为了防止他们累积如此多的东西。</td>

None of the texts say. It would make sense to allow the bhikkhu to begin using the cloth two weeks before the Rains-residence, but this is simply my own opinion.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga then adds three more exemptions: There is no offense for a “snatched-away-robe” bhikkhu, a “destroyed-robe” bhikkhu, or when there are dangers. Strangely enough, the Commentary and the K/Commentary—although both were composed by Buddhaghosa—give conflicting interpretations of these exemptions. The Commentary interprets “robe” here as meaning rains-bathing cloth, and says that these exemptions apply to the dukkaṭa offense for bathing naked in the rain. A bhikkhu whose rains-bathing cloth has been snatched away or destroyed may bathe naked in the rain without incurring a penalty, as may a bhikkhu with an expensive bathing cloth who would rather bathe naked because of his fear of cloth thieves.</td>
<td>然后，《经分别》又增加了三种豁免：「被夺走袈裟」的比丘、「被毁坏袈裟」的比丘，或当有危险时，则不犯戒。奇怪的是，尽管《义注》和 K/《义注》都是由<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>编纂的，但对这些豁免的解释却相互矛盾。《义注》将这里的「袈裟」解释为雨浴衣，并表示这些豁免适用于在雨中裸浴的《突吉罗》罪。比丘的雨浴衣被抢走或毁坏，可以在雨中裸体沐浴而不受惩罚；如果比丘有一件昂贵的浴衣，但是由于害怕盗衣贼，他宁愿裸体沐浴，那么他也可以不受惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary, however, makes the Vibhaṅga’s exemptions refer also to the full offense. If a bhikkhu’s other robes have been snatched away or destroyed, he may wear his rains-bathing cloth out of season. The same holds true when, in the words of the K/Commentary, “naked thieves are plundering,” and a bhikkhu decides to wear his rains-bathing cloth out-of-season in order to protect either it or his other robes from being snatched away.</td>
<td>然而，K/《义注》使《经分别》的豁免也涉及完全违犯。如果比丘的其他袈裟被夺走或毁坏，他可以在非时季节穿著雨浴衣。同样的情况也适用于，用 K/《义注》的话来说，「赤身裸体的盗贼正在掠夺」，而比丘决定在非时季节穿他的雨浴衣，以保护它或其他袈裟不被抢走。</td>

And because the non-offense clauses also state, “from relatives or people who have invited one to ask,” the Commentary also seems right in stating that thread requested from these two types of people would not fulfill this factor. However, none of the texts explicitly assign a penalty for requesting thread that would not fall under the exemptions. Perhaps it would entail a dukkaṭa under the catch-all rule against misbehavior (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Cv.V.36">Cv.V.36</a>).</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that there is a dukkaṭa in the effort of getting the weavers to weave the robe-cloth, which the Commentary explains by saying that the first dukkaṭa is incurred with the weavers’ first effort toward actually making the cloth, with additional dukkaṭas incurred for each additional effort they make. In other words, the dukkaṭa is for <em>successfully</em> getting the weavers to act on one’s request. It may seem strange not to allot a dukkaṭa for the request itself, but the Vibhaṅga to the following rule clearly states that the bhikkhu, in a similar case, incurs a dukkaṭa only when the weavers act on his request to improve a robe. The Vibhaṅga for this rule simply uses the causative—the form of verb describing the act of getting someone else to do something—which is ambiguous, for it could mean either trying to get the weavers to weave the cloth or successfully getting the weavers to weave the cloth. To clear up the ambiguity, the Commentary seems justified in applying the pattern from the following rule here. However, it seems excessive to impose multiple dukkaṭas on the bhikkhu for what, from his point of view, was a single action. There are many rules—such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">Pc 10</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc20">Pc 20</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc56">Pc 56</a>—where a single request carries only one offense even if the person requested does the action many times.</td>
<td>《经分别》中说，在让织匠织造袈裟布的努力，会犯一次《突吉罗》，而《义注》则解释说，第一次《突吉罗》是在织匠第一次努力实际织造布料时发生的，而额外的《突吉罗》则发生在他们每一次额外的努力。换句话说，《突吉罗》是针对<em>成功地</em>让织匠按照自己的要求采取行动。请求本身不犯《突吉罗》似乎很奇怪，但以下戒条的《经分别》明确指出，在类似情况下，只有当织匠根据他的要求改善袈裟时，比丘才会犯《突吉罗》。本戒条的《经分别》仅使用使役动词——描述让别人做某事的行为的动词形式——这是模棱两可的，因为它可能意味著试图让织匠织布，也可能意味著成功地让织匠织布。为了消除歧义，《义注》似乎有理由在此套用以下戒条的模式。然而，从比丘的角度来看，对于一个单一的行动而犯多次《突吉罗》似乎太过度了。有许多戒条（例如<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">《波逸提》十</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc20">《波逸提》二十</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc56">《波逸提》五六</a>），其中单次要求只会构成一次犯戒，即使被要求的人多次执行该行动。</td>

<tr><td>One obtains the cloth. According to the Commentary, the cloth counts as “obtained” when the weavers have completed weaving four by eight fingerbreadths of cloth. It also states that there is an extra NP offense for each added four-by-eight-fingerbreadths section they complete. Neither of these explanations has a precedent anywhere in the Canon. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0041.html#Mv.V.13.13">Mv.V.13.13</a> states clearly that the countdown on the time span of robe-cloth begins only when it is delivered to one’s hand, and the same principle would surely apply here: The full offense is incurred when the robe-cloth is delivered to one’s hand. As for the second explanation, the Vibhaṅga assigns only one full offense for receiving the cloth, which means that a larger piece of cloth would not carry more offenses than a smaller one.</td>
<td>得到了布料。根据《义注》，当织匠织完四乘八指宽的布料时，布料就算「获得」。它还规定，他们每完成一个额外的四乘八指宽的部分，就会被犯一次额外的《舍堕》。这两种解释在《圣典》中都没有任何先例。<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_005#0263a11">《大品》.五.13.13</a>明确指出，袈裟布的时间跨度倒数计时只有当它被送到手中时才开始，同样的原则肯定也适用于这里：当袈裟布被送到手中时，就会完全违犯。至于第二种解释，《经分别》规定接受布料时只完全违犯一次，这意味著一块大布料不会比一块小布料犯更多次戒。</td>

<tr><td>Perception is not a factor here. The Vibhaṅga states if the cloth was woven as a result of one’s request, then even if one perceives it as not having been woven at one’s request or if one is in doubt about the matter, one incurs the full offense. If, on the other hand, the cloth was not woven at one’s request and yet one perceives it as having been woven at one’s request—or one is in doubt about the matter—the penalty on obtaining it is a dukkaṭa.</td>

<td>《义注》将第一项豁免解释为适用于本戒条中提到的第一个行动，这意味著向任何人索取线或纱线来缝制袈裟都没有犯戒。这似乎是正确的，因为豁免的语法形式对于不犯条款来说是不寻常的，而且如果豁免是为了让织匠缝制袈裟，并不遵循《经分别》所采用的模式。。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also states that the exemptions for a knee strap and the other small items also apply to the first action. In other words, one may request thread or yarn from anyone to make these items, but may not get weavers to weave them. This explanation seems designed to support the Commentary’s position that a piece of cloth measuring four by eight fingerbreadths would be grounds for a full offense under this rule. Here, however, the grammatical form of the relevant exemptions does <em>not</em> support the Commentary’s assertion, for it follows a pattern typical throughout the Vibhaṅga for non-offenses related to the main action covered by a rule. Thus there would be no offense in providing weavers with thread with which to make small items of this sort. Because these articles can be quickly woven, this may have been a common courtesy that weavers extended to contemplatives in the Buddha’s time.</td>
<td>《义注》也指出，膝带和其他小件物品的豁免也适用于第一个行动。换句话说，可以向任何人要求线或纱来制作这些物品，但不能让织匠来编织它们。这个解释似乎是设计来支持《义注》的观点，即一块尺寸为四指乘以八指宽的布料将构成本戒条规定的完全违犯行为的理由。然而，这里相关豁免的语法形式并<em>不</em>支持《义注》的断言，因为它遵循了整个《经分别》中关于与戒条涵盖的主要行为相关的不犯的典型模式。因此，向织匠提供用于制作此类小物件的线并不犯戒。由于这些物品可以快速编织完成，这可能是佛陀时代织匠对沙门的常见礼遇。</td>

<tr><td>If the cloth is obtained by means of one’s own resources—i.e., one arranges to pay for the thread and hire the weavers—the Commentary states that one is responsible for the cloth as soon as it is finished and fully paid for, regardless of whether it is delivered into one’s possession. One must therefore determine it for use within 10 days of that date so as not to commit an offense under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP1">NP 1</a>. (Alternatively, the Commentary suggests, one may avoid this difficulty by not giving full payment for the cloth until it is delivered.) If, after one has given full payment for the cloth, the weavers promise to send word when the cloth is done, one’s responsibility starts when one receives word from their messenger; if they have promised to send the cloth when done, one’s responsibility begins when their messenger delivers it. At any rate, as with its explanation of “obtaining cloth” under this rule, the Commentary’s statements here conflict with the principle in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0041.html#Mv.V.13.13">Mv.V.13.13</a>, in which the countdown on the time span of the cloth begins only when it is delivered to one’s hand.</td>

<tr><td>One approaches the weavers and gets them to improve the cloth in any of the seven ways mentioned in the rule. Although the rule seems to indicate that the factor of effort is completed only when the weavers receive the promised reward, the Vibhaṅga says simply that it is completed when, as a result of one’s statement, the weavers improve the cloth as requested. In addition, the non-offense clauses give no exemption for a bhikkhu who does not give the promised reward. Thus, the bhikkhu does not have to give the reward for this factor to be fulfilled. The commentaries follow the Vibhaṅga on this point, and add that the bhikkhu’s statement need not even include a promise of a reward. As the Commentary puts it, the bhikkhu’s words quoted in the rule are meant simply as an example of any way in which one might get them to add more thread to the cloth. The Sub-commentary, however, notes that of the seven ways of improving the cloth, only the first three involve added thread. Its implied conclusion is that any statement that succeeds in getting the weavers to improve the cloth in any of these seven ways would fulfill the factor of effort here, regardless of whether the improvement involves adding more thread.</td>
<td>联系织匠并让他们按照戒条中提到的七种方法中的任何一种方法来改进布料。虽然戒条似乎表明，只有当织匠收到承诺的奖励时，努力的因素才算完成，但《经分别》仅说，当织匠根据陈述，按照要求改进布料时，努力的因素就完成。此外，不犯条款并未给予没有承诺奖励的比丘任何豁免。因此，比丘不必给予奖励就满足这个因素。注释书在这一点上遵循了《经分别》，并补充说，比丘的陈述甚至不需要包括奖励的承诺。正如《义注》中所说，戒条中引用的比丘的话只是为了举例说明如何让他们在布上添加更多的线。然而，《复注》指出，在七种改良布料的方法中，只有前三种需要添加线。其隐含的结论是，任何成功地让织匠以这七种方式中的任何一种来改进布料的陈述都可以满足这里的努力因素，不管这种改进是否涉及添加更多的线。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the promised reward, the Vibhaṅga defines <em>almsfood</em> as covering anything of even the slightest material value—food, a lump of powder, tooth wood, unwoven thread, or even a phrase of Dhamma. (For example, the bhikkhu might try to get the weavers to improve the cloth by promising to describe the merit they will gain by doing so.) Note, however, that almsfood is defined as the minimal amount of reward. There is no maximum on what might be promised. Thus, even if the bhikkhu promises to pay in full for any added materials or time that the weavers might devote to the robe, he does not escape fulfilling this factor of the offense. (Some have objected that it should be all right for the bhikkhu to pay in full for the improvements in the robe, but remember that to do so would be an insult to the donors.)</td>
<td>至于承诺的奖励，《经分别》将钵食定义为任何具有最微小物质价值的东西，如食物、一块粉末、牙木、未编织的线、甚至一句佛法。（例如，比丘可能会试图让织匠改善布料，并承诺描述他们这样做将获得的功德。）但请注意，钵食被定义为最低限度的奖励。对于承诺之物没有上限。因此，即使比丘承诺全额支付织匠为制作袈裟所花费的任何额外材料或时间，他仍然逃脱不了满足本戒的此因素。（有些人反对，认为比丘全额支付改善袈裟的费用是可以的，但请记住，这样做是对施主的侮辱。）</td>

<td>紧急供养的袈裟布是六种允许类型的袈裟布中的任一种，尺寸至少为四指宽乘以八指宽，供养条件如下：供养者是想要获得更大功德的人，有些人认为，在袈裟季节布施布料可以增加功德，但不想等到袈裟季节再去供养，要么是因为他/她怀疑是否能活到那时—例如当士兵奔赴战场，旅人即将启程，或妇女怀孕时—或者因为他/她对宗教建立了新的信仰。在前雨季居结束时从上弦月的第五天到第十五天的任何时间（见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#BMC2chapter11">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第十一章</a>），他/她派遣使者去见比丘们，说道：「愿尊者们到来。我正在布施雨安居（布料）。（《义注》补充说，布施者也可以自己把布带给比丘。）出于对布施者的慈悲，比丘应该接受布，然后在放在一边之前，将其标记为紧急供养的袈裟布。然后，可以在整个袈裟季节（雨季后的第一个月，如果没有敷展功德衣；如果有敷展的话，功德衣方便利益的有效期限）保留这块布料。</td>

<td>问题是，为什么要标记它？</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary argues that, because the cloth counts as Rains-residence cloth, it can appropriately be shared out only among bhikkhus who have kept the Rains-residence up to that point. If any other bhikkhu receives such a piece of cloth, he must give it back, as it belongs to the Community. Thus the mark is for the purpose of recognizing it as such. However, if this were the rationale, there would be no reason to treat the cloth any differently from other gifts of Rains-residence cloth. A more likely rationale for the mark is suggested by a later passage in the Commentary: Other gifts of cloth received during the last ten days of the Rains-residence carry a life span that can, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP1">NP 1</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP21">3</a>, extend past the end of the robe season. If, for instance, the cloth is offered five days before the end of the Rains, then after the end of the robe season, it can be kept—without determining it or placing it under shared ownership—for an additional five days; if it is not enough to make a robe, it can be kept for up to an additional 25. Robe-cloth offered in urgency, however—as the Vibhaṅga makes clear—carries a life-span that cannot extend past the end of the robe season. Thus, on receiving such a gift of cloth, one should mark it as such before putting it away so as not to forget its status when the end of the robe season approaches.</td>
<td>《义注》认为，因为这块布料算是雨安居布料，所以只有在雨安居期间一直保留著住处的比丘们之间才能适当地分配它。如果任何其他比丘收到这样的一块布，他必须归还，因为它属于僧团。因此，该标记的目的在于使其被识别。然而，如果这是理由的话，就没有理由将这块布料与其他雨安居布料的布施区别对待了。《义注》后面的一段话提出了这个标记更可能存在的理由：雨安居最后十天收到的其他布料布施的寿命，根据<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP1">《舍堕》一</a>或<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP3">三</a>，可以延续到袈裟季节结束后。例如，如果在雨季结束前五天布料被供养了，那么在袈裟季节结束后，它可以被再保留五天——无需决意它或将其置于共享所有权之下；如果不够制作一件袈裟，还可以再保留二十五天。然而，正如《经分别》明确指出的，紧急供养的袈裟布的使用寿命不会超过袈裟季节的结束。因此，在收到这样的布料布施时，应该在放在一边之前做好标记，以免在袈裟季节结束到来时忘记它的状态。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga explains the phrase, “after having observed the Kattika full moon,” as meaning that, having completed the first Rains-residence, one is now in the fourth month of the rainy season. As we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP2">NP 2</a>, that rule—unlike <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP1">NP 1</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP21">3</a>—is not automatically rescinded during this month. However, the origin story to this rule indicates that this period was a dangerous time for bhikkhus living in wilderness areas, as thieves were active—perhaps because they knew that bhikkhus had just received new requisites, or simply because now that roads had become passable it was time to get back to their work. This rule was thus formulated to provide a bhikkhu living in a dangerous wilderness area with a safe place to keep a robe away from his lodging as long as certain conditions are met. The Commentary notes that this rule would be of special use to bhikkhus who have completed their robes, ended their kaṭhina privileges, and so want to settle down in the wilderness to meditate. If it so happens that a bhikkhu’s kaṭhina privileges are still in effect, he has no need for the allowance under this rule because <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP2">NP 2</a> is automatically rescinded as part of those privileges, which means that he can keep his robes in a safe place away from his lodging as long as he wants.</td>
<td>《经分别》解释道，「在奉行咖底咖月满月之后」这句话的意思是，已经完成前雨安居，现在正处于雨季的第四个月。正如我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP2">《舍堕》二</a>中提到的，与<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP1">《舍堕》一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP3">三</a>不同，该戒条不会在此月自动失效。然而，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0372a08">本戒条的起源故事</a>表明，对于生活在荒野地区的比丘来说，这个时期是一段危险的时期，因为小偷很活跃——也许是因为他们知道比丘刚刚收到新的必需品，或者只是因为现在道路已经可以通行，是时候回去工作了。制定本戒条的目的是，只要满足某些条件，为生活在危险荒野地区的比丘提供一个远离他的住处的安全地方存放袈裟。《义注》指出这条戒条对那些已完成袈裟、结束功德衣方便利益，并因此想要在荒野定居禅修的比丘特别有用。如果比丘的功德衣方便利益仍然有效，那么他就不需要根据本戒条获得开缘，因为<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP2">《舍堕》二</a>作为这些方便利益的一部分已自动失效，这意味著只要他愿意，他可以将他的袈裟放在远离他的住所的安全地方。</td>

2）他住在荒野住所，《经分别》将其定义为距离最近的村庄至少 500 弓长或 1 公里的住所，此距离以两村之间最短的步行路径测量，而非直线距离。同时，他离村庄也不太远，早上他可以去那里托钵，然后在中午之前返回住处吃饭。</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><div class="mx-2 first last docutils container">
3) The lodging is dubious and risky. According to the Vibhaṅga, <em>dubious</em> means that signs of thieves—such as their eating, resting, sitting, or standing places—have been seen within it or its vicinity; <em>risky</em> means that people are known to have been hurt or plundered by thieves there. Unlike other rules occurring later in the Pāṭimokkha that mention the vicinity of a lodging—such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">Pc 15</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc84">84</a>—none of the texts define precisely how far the vicinity extends for the purpose of this rule. This lack of a precise definition also occurs in the other rule dealing with dangerous wilderness lodgings, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0025.html#Pd4">Pd 4</a>. Given the risks inherent in such places, perhaps it was felt unwise to delimit the area in too precise a manner. Thus, in the context of this rule, the “vicinity” of the lodging can be stretched to include any area where the presence of thieves leads to a common perception that the lodging is dangerous.</div>

3）住所可疑，有风险。根据《经分别》的说法，<em>可疑</em>的意思是，在其内部或其附近发现了小偷的迹象，例如他们吃饭、休息、坐著或站立的地方；<em>危险</em>意味著已知有人在那里受到盗贼伤害或抢劫。与《波罗提木叉》里后期出现的提到了住所的附近区域的其他戒条不同——例如<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">《波逸提》十五</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0024/#Pc84">八四</a>——没有任何文献为本戒条精确地定义附近区域延伸到多远。这种缺乏精确定义的现象也出现在另一个处理危险荒野住所的戒条，<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0025.html#Pd4">《应悔过》四</a>。因此，在本戒条的背景下，住所的「附近」可以扩大到包括任何因小偷的存在而导致人们普遍认为住所很危险的区域。</div>

</tr>
<tr><td>As the Sub-commentary points out, the Commentary and K/Commentary differ in their definition of the factor of effort here—in particular, as to what it means to be apart from one’s robe. The difference centers on how the two commentaries interpret one of the non-offense clauses: “Having been apart for six nights, having entered the village territory (gāma-sīmā) again, having stayed there (to greet dawnrise), he departs.” The K/Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, at the seventh dawnrise, one is in one’s wilderness dwelling, one incurs the full offense, but if one enters the village territory for the seventh dawnrise, one can then leave the robes there for another six dawns. This means that the bhikkhu counts as being apart from his robe when it is placed in the village and he is in his wilderness lodging.</td>
<td>正如《复注》所指出的，《义注》和 K/《义注》对这里的努力因素的定义有所不同——特别是对于离开袈裟的含义。差异在于两部注释书如何解释其中一条不犯条款：「离开六夜，进入村界（gāma-sīmā），住于彼处（迎接黎明），他离开。」 K/《义注》将此解释为，如果在第七个黎明时分，在自己的荒野住所，那么就完全违犯，但是，如果他在第七个黎明时分进入村界，那么他可以把袈裟留在那里另外六个黎明。这意味著，当比丘将他的袈裟放在村庄里并且他自己在荒野住所时，他就算是与他的袈裟离开了。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary, however, interprets the non-offense clause as covering a different and very particular situation: The bhikkhu is away from both the village and the lodging, and as the seventh dawnrise approaches he is closer to the village than the lodging. The non-offense clause allows him to enter the village, stay in the public hall or any other spot in the village, check up on his robe, and then return to his dwelling, free from an offense. From this interpretation, the Sub-commentary, following Bhadanta Buddhadatta Thera, concludes that the bhikkhu is not counted as apart from his robe when it is placed in the village and he is staying in his lodging. Thus he can leave the robe in the village for the entire fourth month of the rainy season, but if he leaves that lodging on business and lets his robe remain in the village, he may stay away from the lodging or the village only six dawns at a stretch.</td>
<td>然而，《义注》将不犯条款解释为涵盖一种不同的、非常特殊的情况：比丘远离村庄和住处，随著第七个黎明的临近，他距离村庄比距离住处更近。不犯条款允许他进入村庄，留在公共大厅或村庄的任何其他地方，检查他的袈裟，然后返回他的住所，而不犯戒。根据这种解释，《复注》遵循了<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/b/buddhadatta/">佛授长老</a>的结论，认为当比丘的袈裟被放置在村落中并且比丘住在住处时，他不算与袈裟分开。因此，他可以在雨季的整个第四个月将袈裟留在村子里，但是，如果他因事离开住处，而将袈裟留在村子里，那么他只可连续六个黎明离开住处或村庄。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There are minor problems with both interpretations. The Commentary’s explanation of the non-offense clause seems forced, but the K/Commentary’s interpretation ignores the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “any reason”—i.e., “any business”—which under other rules indicates situations where a bhikkhu would be away from his lodging. The reason for this rule, as suggested by the origin story, was similar to that for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP2">NP 2</a>: When the bhikkhus were away from their robes, the robes “were lost, destroyed, burned, eaten by rats.” If the bhikkhu is staying in his lodging and going for alms in the village, he may check up on his robe every day to make sure that it is safe and sound. The Commentary’s interpretation seems preferable, but both interpretations would fulfill what seems to be the purpose for the rule, so the question of which interpretation to follow is up to each Community.</td>
<td>这两种解释都存在一些小问题。《义注》对不犯条款的解释似乎有些牵强，但 K/《义注》的解释忽略了《经分别》对「任何原因」的定义——即「任何事务」——在其他戒条下，这表示比丘离开住处的情况。起源故事表明，这条戒条的原因与<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP2">《舍堕》二</a>的原因类似：当比丘们离开他们的袈裟时，袈裟「会遗失、被毁坏、被烧毁、被老鼠吃掉」。如果比丘住在住处并去村里托钵，他可以每天检查他的袈裟，以确保其安全无虞。《义注》的解释似乎更可取，但两种解释似乎都可以实现该戒条的目的，因此遵循哪种解释的问题取决于每个僧团。</td>

The PTS edition essentially holds that perception is not a factor here, saying that if one diverts to oneself an item that has actually been allocated to a Community, then whether one perceives the item as allocated or not allocated or is doubtful about the matter, one incurs the full offense in every case. This reading is clearly mistaken, as it does not account for the word <em>knowingly</em> in the rule. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions list the penalties for the same cases as follows: perceiving it as allocated, the full offense; in doubt about the matter, a dukkaṭa; perceiving it as not allocated, a dukkaṭa. The Thai edition lists the penalties as follows: perceiving it as allocated, the full offense; in doubt about the matter, a dukkaṭa; perceiving it as not allocated, no offense. This last reading is most consistent with the word <em>knowingly</em> in the rule and the Vibhaṅga’s general treatment of rules that include this word. In particular, it corresponds to the parallel passage under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc82">Pc 82</a> as given in all four major editions, and is also supported by the K/Commentary to this rule even in its PTS edition.

This, however, seems unnecessarily harsh, for in the case where the donors <em>do</em> give the item to the bhikkhu who tries to divert it to himself, he can receive it back after having forfeited it and then use it as he likes. To impose a heavier penalty on a bhikkhu for not being successful in diverting items to himself seems unfair, and the Vibhaṅga’s judgment here seems preferable: that the penalty in this case would simply be a dukkaṭa for fulfilling the factor of effort.</td>

<tr><td><strong>Non-offenses</strong></td>
<td><strong>不犯</strong></td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga discusses the non-offenses under this rule in two different contexts. As we noted above, in its passage on perception it says that if one perceives a planned donation as not yet allocated for a particular recipient, one incurs no offense in diverting it to oneself or to others. In the non-offense clauses, however, aside from the standard exemptions, the Vibhaṅga states simply that if one is asked, “Where do we give (this)?” one may answer, “Give wherever your gift would be used, or would be well-cared for, or would last long, or wherever your mind feels inspired.”</td>
<td>《经分别》从两个不同的脉络讨论了本戒条下的不犯。正如我们上面提到的，在关于感知的段落中，它说，如果认为计划中的捐献尚未分配给特定的接受者，那么将其转移给自己或他人并不会犯戒。然而，在不犯条款中，除了标准豁免之外，《经分别》仅规定，如果被问到，「我们应该把（这个）布施给哪里？」可以回答：「布施给任何被需要用到的地方，或会被精心保管的地方，或会长久保存的地方，或让你感到受到启发的地方。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question is, why the exemption for perception was not included in the non-offense clauses. The apparent answer is that that exemption absolves one from an offense under this rule, but not from offenses under other rules concerning inappropriate requests. In particular, as we have noted above, this rule contains no exemption for diverting an item perceived as allocated even when the donors are relatives or people who have invited one to ask. However, if one perceives the item as not allocated, it would not come under this rule, and so one can request it from people such as these or in other instances where requests for items of that sort are allowed. Aside from these instances, though, one may still not request the item even when perceiving it as not allocated. In other words, perceiving an item as not allocated does not give carte blanche to divert it as one likes.</td>
<td>问题是，为什么感知豁免没有被列入不犯条款。显而易见的答案是，该豁免可以免除根据本戒条所犯的罪行，但不能免除根据其他戒条有关不适当要求所犯的罪行。特别是，正如我们上面提到的，即使施主是亲属或邀请其询问的人，本戒条也不包含转移被视为已分配物品的豁免。然而，如果认为该物品尚未被分配，就不属于本戒条，因此可以向这些人提出请求，或在允许此类物品请求的其他情况下提出请求。但是，除了这些情况之外，即使认为物品尚未被分配，仍然不可要求该物品。换句话说，认为物品未被分配并不代表可以随心所欲地转移它。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clause, it is similar to a passage in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN3_24.html">SN 3:24</a>, where King Pasenadi asks the Buddha where a gift should be given, and the Buddha replies, “Wherever the mind feels inspired.” This is an important point of bhikkhu etiquette. Throughout the early texts, the act of generosity is treated as an expression of the donor’s freedom of choice and an illustration of the principle of action. If there were no freedom of choice, actions would be predetermined and there would be no motivation to follow a path of action leading to the end of suffering. When a donor gives a gift, he/she is experiencing a moment of freedom from the claims of greed and possessiveness, and gaining direct experience of the benefits of exercising that freedom. For this reason, the Buddha was careful never to infringe on that freedom by suggesting that there was an obligation to give gifts. When King Pasenadi, in the same sutta, asked the Buddha where a gift, when given, bears great fruit, the Buddha stated that this was a different question entirely, and one that he could answer directly: “What is given to a virtuous person—rather than to an unvirtuous one—bears great fruit.”</td>
<td>至于《经分别》中的不犯条款，与<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/03.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E5%9B%9B%E5%BC%93%E7%AE%AD%E6%89%8B">《相应部》3:24经</a>中的一段话类似，波斯匿王问佛陀应该布施在哪里，佛陀回答说：「心受到启发的地方。」这是比丘威仪的重要一点。在早期文献中，慷慨行为被视为施主选择自由的表达和行动原则的体现。如果没有选择的自由，行动就会被预先决定，就没有动机去遵循一条导致苦的止息的行动之道。当施主布施时，他/她会体验到摆脱贪婪和占有欲束缚的自由，并直接体验到行使这种自由的好处。基于这个原因，佛陀非常小心，从不建议有布施的义务来侵犯这种自由。在同一部经中，当波斯匿王问佛陀，什么样的布施能够结出大果报时，佛陀表示，这是一个完全不同的问题，他可以直接回答：「给予有德之人，而非无德之人，才会结出大果报。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, following the Buddha’s example, a bhikkhu may tell where a gift bears great fruit, but even when asked where a gift should be given he may not be more specific than the Buddha’s response in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN3_24.html">SN 3:24</a> or the response in the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clause here. When not asked, he has no business at all telling people where they should give their gifts, regardless of how noble his motives may seem in his eyes.</td>
<td>因此，效法佛陀的例子，比丘可以说出在何处布施会带来大果报，但即使被问及应该在何处布施，他的回答也不可比佛陀在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/03.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E5%9B%9B%E5%BC%93%E7%AE%AD%E6%89%8B">《相应部》3:24经</a>中的回答或此处《经分别》的不犯条款中的回答更具体。当没有人问起时，他根本没有权利告诉人们应该布施给哪里，不管在他眼里他的动机有多么高贵。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary provides an additional example of what it regards as proper etiquette in this case: If donors come to a bhikkhu, expressing a desire to give a gift to a Community, a shrine, or an individual bhikkhu, adding that they want to give it in line with his preference, the bhikkhu may say, “Give where you want.” If they are inspired by this remark and give the gift to him, he incurs no offense. The Commentary adds, though, that if the donors express a general desire to give without saying that they want to give in line with the bhikkhu’s preference, he may say only what is stated in the non-offense clause.</td>
<td>《义注》还提供了一个额外的例子，说明在这种情况下什么是适当的威仪：如果施主们来到一位比丘面前，表达了想要向僧团、<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%AF%E6%8F%90_(%E5%BB%BA%E7%AD%91)">支提</a>、或一位比丘个人布施的愿望，并补充说他们想按照他的喜好来布施，比丘可以说，「布施给你想要的地方。」如果他们被这句话启发，并把布施给他，他不犯戒。然而，《义注》补充道，如果施主表达了一般性的布施愿望，而没有说他们想按照比丘的喜好来布施，那么他只能说不犯条款中所述的内容。</td>

<td>比丘若犯下此三十种《舍堕》罪中的任何一种，在忏悔其罪行之前，必须先舍出所犯的物品。如果他在舍出该物品之前使用它，他犯额外一次《突吉罗》 —— 违反<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0014/#NP18">《舍堕》十八</a>或<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0014/#NP19">十九</a>而收到的金钱除外，如果用于交易，会涉及另一次《舍堕》。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0014/#NP20">《舍堕》二十</a>的《义注》指出，如果物品在比丘舍出之前丢失，毁坏或被用尽，他可以仅忏悔《波逸提》。如果物品被抢走或丢弃，情况显然也是一样适用。</td>

<tr><td>Aside from cases where forfeiture must be made in the midst of a Community of four bhikkhus or more (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">NP 18</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP19">19</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP22">22</a>), the offender may forfeit the item to a single bhikkhu, to a group of two or three, or to a Community of four or more. Once he has confessed the offense, he is cleared of the penalty.</td>
<td>除必须在四名或四名以上比丘的僧团中舍出物品的情况（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0014/#NP18">《舍堕》十八</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0014/#NP19">十九</a>和<a class="reference external" href="#NP22">二二</a>）外，犯戒者可以将物品舍出给单一比丘，或者两人或三人比丘群体，或者四人或四人以上的比丘僧团。一旦他忏悔了罪行，他就清除了惩罚。</td>

<tr><td>In cases where he must forfeit the item in the midst of the Community, he may not receive it in return. In the remaining cases, though, the item must be returned to him. Not to do so entails a dukkaṭa for the bhikkhu(s) to whom it is forfeited. In two cases—NP 22 &amp; 23—there are restrictions as to what a bhikkhu may and may not do with the item received in return after forfeiture, but apart from these rules he is free to use the returned item as he likes.</td>
<td>在他必须于僧团中舍出该物品的情况下，他不可接受该物品归还。不过，在其余情况下，物品必须归还给他。如果不这样做，接收该舍出物品的比丘犯《突吉罗》。在两种情况下——<a class="reference external" href="#NP22">《舍堕》二二</a>和<a class="reference external" href="#NP23">二三</a>——对于比丘在舍出后可以和不可以对所收到的归还物品做什么有所限制，但除了这些戒条之外，他可以自由随意地使用归还的物品。</td>

<tr><td>The act of forfeiture is thus symbolic in most cases, and the effect of the rules is more internal: The offender may not make use of the item until he has confessed his wrong doing, and this in itself should give him time to reflect on his actions. If the item has been obtained or made in an inappropriate way, the act of handing it over to another provides the opportunity to reflect on whether it is worth whatever greed, anger, or delusion it has sparked in one’s mind. If the item has been held in possession either too long (as under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP1">NP 1</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP21">21</a>) or not kept in one’s care at the necessary time (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP2">NP 2</a>), one can reflect on this evidence of one’s carelessness and on the need for heightened mindfulness.</td>
<td>因此，舍出行为在大多数情况下是象征性的，戒条的效果更多的是内在的：犯戒者在忏悔错误行为之前不得使用该物品，这本身会给他时间反思自己的行为。如果该物品是透过不适当的方式获得或制作的，那么将其交给他人的行为提供了一个机会来反思它是否值得在一个人心中激起的贪、嗔或痴。如果该物品被持有的时间过长（如<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP1">《舍堕》一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="#NP21">二一</a> 所述）或在必要的时间内不在自己的照料中（如<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP2">《舍堕》二</a>），则可以反思这一粗心大意的证据，并认识到需要提高正念。</td>
