<tr><td>This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.</td>
<td>根据《附随》，这个术语源自于一个动词，意思是「失去」或「被击败」。比丘若犯下列四条戒中的任何一种，就已经屈服于自己的心理烦恼，以致他违背了自己成为比丘的初衷。《经分别》中用许多比喻说明了这种击败的不可挽回的性质：「就像一个人的头被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的叶子脱离了茎……就像一块被碎成两半的扁平石头无法再拼凑起来……就像一棵被砍掉树冠的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B3%96%E6%A3%95">糖棕</a>无法进一步生长一样。” 犯下任何这些戒的比丘不可挽回地从僧团生活中断绝，并且不再被视为比丘。</td>

<tr><td>As we noted in the Introduction, the first formulation of this rule followed on Ven. Sudinna’s having had sex with one of his former wives. His motives, by worldly standards, were relatively noble: He was complying with his parents’ desire that he provide them with an heir. However, in the incident leading to the second formulation of this rule—in which the Buddha added the phrase “even with a female animal”—the instigator’s motives were considerably less so.</td>
<td>正如我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0006/">引言</a>中指出的，这条戒条的最初制定是在须提那尊者与他的前妻们之一发生了性关系。按照世俗的标准，他的动机相对崇高：他遵守父母的愿望，为他们提供一个继承人。然而，在导致第二次制定这条戒条的事件中——佛陀在其中添加了「即使是与雌性动物」这句话——犯戒者的动机却远非如此。</td>

<p>“Now at that time, a certain bhikkhu living in the Great Wood at Vesālī, having befriended a monkey with food (§), engaged in sexual intercourse with it. Then, dressing (§) early in the morning and carrying his bowl and outer robe, the bhikkhu went into Vesālī for alms. A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§). The thought occurred to the bhikkhus, ‘Undoubtedly this bhikkhu is engaging in sexual intercourse with this monkey.’ So they hid off to one side.</p>
<p>“Then the bhikkhu, having gone for alms in Vesālī, returned bringing almsfood. The monkey went up to him. The bhikkhu, having eaten a portion of the almsfood, gave a portion to the monkey. The monkey, having eaten the almsfood, offered its rear to the bhikkhu, and the bhikkhu engaged in sexual intercourse with it (§).</p>
<p>“Then the bhikkhus said to the bhikkhu, ‘Hasn’t a training rule been formulated by the Blessed One? How can you engage in sexual intercourse with this monkey?’</p>
<p>“‘It’s true, friends, that a training rule has been formulated by the Blessed One, but that’s with regard to a human female, not to a female animal.’”</p>

<p>「当时，有一位比丘住在毘舍离大林里，以食物与一只猴子结交（§），并与它交合。然后，比丘一大早穿好衣服，带著钵和外衣，到毘舍离去托钵。众多比丘巡行房舍，来到了该比丘的住处。猴子远远地看见他们来了，一见他们，就走到他们面前，摇著臀部，摇著尾巴，把臀部拱了出来，做了个淫相（§）。比丘们心想：「毫无疑问，这位比丘正在与这只猴子交合。」于是他们躲到一边。</p>
<p>「然后，比丘在毘舍离托钵之后，带著托钵食物回来了。猴子向他走来。比丘吃完一部分钵食后，将一部分给予猴子。猴子吃完钵食后，将它的屁股示现给比丘，比丘就与它交合（§）。
「然后，诸比丘对该比丘说：『世尊不是制定了学处吗？你怎么能和这只猴子交合呢？</p>

<tr><td>The term <em>sexual intercourse</em> refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (<em>passāva-magga</em>)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (<em>vacca-magga</em>); or the mouth (<em>mukha</em>). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using <em>magga</em> (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and <em>amagga</em> (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.</td>
<td><em>性交</em>一词是指所有类型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（<em>passāva-magga</em>），即女性的阴道或男性的阴茎）；肛门（<em>vacca-magga</em>）；或嘴（<em>mukha</em>）。《经分别》总结了这些孔穴的各种可能的组合，并得出结论：除了口对口的插入（在下面的衍生违犯中处理）之外，所有这些孔穴都满足了这里的努力因素。不幸的是，《经分别》的总结是用技术术语表达的，使用 <em>magga</em> （道）来表示生殖器或肛门，使用 <em>amagga</em> （非道）来表示嘴。《义注》在讨论总结时，错误地将嘴也归类为道，因此必须为「非道」发明一个不同的意义：与三道之一接壤的伤口。由于《义注》对这一点的讨论是基于误解，因此无需进一步追究。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，当在该戒条涵盖的任何可能的组合中，一个器官进入另一个器官时，即使只是达到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表发生了性交。这意味著比丘进行性交、口交或肛交时，无论他扮演什么角色，都必须遵守这条戒条。器官之间是否有覆盖物（例如保险套）的问题无关紧要，比丘是主动参与还是被动参与，以及参与的任何一方是否达到性高潮的问题都是无关紧要的。</td>
