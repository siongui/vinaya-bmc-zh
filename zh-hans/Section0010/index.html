<tr><td>This term, according to the Parivāra, derives from a verb meaning to lose or be defeated. A bhikkhu who commits any of the four following offenses has surrendered to his own mental defilements to such an extent that he defeats the purpose of his having become a bhikkhu in the first place. The irrevocable nature of this defeat is illustrated in the Vibhaṅga with a number of similes: “as a man with his head cut off… as a withered leaf freed from its stem… as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together again… as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth.” A bhikkhu who commits any of these offenses severs himself irrevocably from the life of the Saṅgha and is no longer considered a bhikkhu.</td>
<td>根据《附随》，这个术语源自于一个动词，意思是「失去」或「被击败」。比丘若犯下列四条戒中的任何一种，就已经屈服于自己的心理烦恼，以致他违背了自己成为比丘的初衷。《经分别》中用许多比喻说明了这种击败的不可挽回的性质：「就像一个人的头被砍掉了……就像一片枯萎的叶子脱离了茎……就像一块被碎成两半的扁平石头无法再拼凑起来……就像一棵被砍掉树冠的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B3%96%E6%A3%95">糖棕</a>无法进一步生长一样。” 犯下任何这些戒的比丘不可挽回地从僧团生活中断绝，并且不再被视为比丘。</td>

A number of bhikkhus wandering on a tour of the lodgings went to the bhikkhu’s dwelling. The monkey saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, went up to them and wiggled its rear and wiggled its tail and offered its rear and made a sign (§).

<tr><td>The term <em>sexual intercourse</em> refers to all kinds of sexual intercourse involving genitals (literally, the “urine path” (<em>passāva-magga</em>)—i.e., a woman’s vagina or a man’s penis); the anus (<em>vacca-magga</em>); or the mouth (<em>mukha</em>). The Vibhaṅga summarizes the various possible combinations of these orifices, and concludes that all of them—except for mouth-to-mouth penetration, which is treated under Derived Offenses, below—fulfill the factor of effort here. Unfortunately, the Vibhaṅga’s summary is couched in technical terminology, using <em>magga</em> (path) to mean either the genitals or the anal orifice, and <em>amagga</em> (not-path) to mean the mouth. The Commentary, in discussing the summary, mistakenly classifies the mouth as a magga as well, and so has to invent a different meaning for amagga: a wound bordering on one of the three maggas. Because the Commentary’s discussion of this point is based on a misunderstanding, there is no need to pursue it in further detail.</td>
<td><em>性交</em>一词是指所有类型的性交，涉及生殖器（字面意思是「尿道」（<em>passāva-magga</em>），即女性的阴道或男性的阴茎）；肛门（<em>vacca-magga</em>）；或嘴（<em>mukha</em>）。《经分别》总结了这些孔穴的各种可能的组合，并得出结论：除了口对口的插入（在下面的衍生违犯中处理）之外，所有这些孔穴都满足了这里的努力因素。不幸的是，《经分别》的总结是用技术术语表达的，使用 <em>magga</em> （道）来表示生殖器或肛门，使用 <em>amagga</em> （非道）来表示嘴。《义注》在讨论总结时，错误地将嘴也归类为道，因此必须为「非道」发明一个不同的意义：与三道之一接壤的伤口。由于《义注》对这一点的讨论是基于误解，因此无需进一步追究。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that sexual intercourse has been performed when, in any of the possible combinations covered by this rule, one organ enters the other even if just to “the extent of a sesame seed.” This means that a bhikkhu engaging in genital, oral, or anal intercourse is subject to this rule regardless of which role he plays. The question of whether there is a covering, such as a condom, between the organs is irrelevant, as are the questions of whether the bhikkhu is actively or passively involved, and whether any of the parties involved reaches orgasm.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，当在该戒条涵盖的任何可能的组合中，一个器官进入另一个器官时，即使只是达到“芝麻籽的程度”，也代表发生了性交。这意味著比丘进行性交、口交或肛交时，无论他扮演什么角色，都隶属于这条戒条。器官之间是否有覆盖物（例如保险套）的问题不相干，比丘是主动参与还是被动参与，以及参与的任何一方是否达到性高潮的问题都是不相干的。</td>

<tr><td>For sexual intercourse to count as an offense, the bhikkhu must know that it is happening and give his consent. Thus if he is sexually assaulted while asleep or otherwise unconscious and remains oblivious to what is happening, he incurs no penalty. If, however, he becomes conscious during the assault or was conscious right from the start, then whether he incurs a penalty depends on whether he gives his consent during any part of the act.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>Strangely enough, neither the Canon nor the Commentary discusses the factor of consent in any detail, except to mention by way of passing that it can apply to the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out. From the examples in the Vinīta-vatthu, it would appear that consent refers to a <em>mental</em> state of acquiescence, together with its physical or verbal expression. Mere physical compliance does not count, as there are cases where bhikkhus forced into intercourse comply physically but without consenting mentally and so are absolved of any offense. However, there is also a case in which a woman invites a bhikkhu to engage in sexual intercourse, saying that she will do all the work while he can avoid an offense by doing nothing. The bhikkhu does as she tells him to, but when the case comes to the Buddha’s attention, the Buddha imposes a pārājika on the act without even asking the bhikkhu whether he consented or not. The assumption is that complying with a request like this indicates consent, regardless of whether one makes any physical or verbal movement at all.</td>
<td>奇怪的是，《圣典》和《义注》都没有详细讨论同意因素，只是顺便提到它可以适用于插入、完全插入、留在原处或拔出的阶段。从《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的例子来看，同意看来是指一种默许的<em>心理</em>状态，连同其身体或言语表达。仅仅身体上的顺从并不算数，因为在某些情况下，比丘被迫进行性交，但没有心理上的同意，因此没有犯任何戒。然而，也有一种情况，女人邀请比丘发生性行为，说她会做所有的工作，他什么都不做就可以避免犯戒。比丘照她的吩咐去做，但当这件事引起佛陀的注意时，佛陀甚至没有询问比丘是否同意，就认定该行为犯《波罗夷》。前提是，遵守这样的请求就表明同意，无论一个人是否做出任何身体或口头动作。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Taken together, these cases imply that if one is sexually assaulted, one is completely absolved from an offense only if (1) one does not give one’s mental consent at any time during the act or (2) one does feel mental consent during at least part of the act but puts up a struggle so as not to express that consent physically or verbally in any way. (As the Commentary notes, drawing a general principle from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>, mere mental consent without physical expression is not enough to count as a factor of an offense, for there is no offense simply in the arising of a thought or mental state.) If one puts up no struggle and feels mental consent, even if only fleetingly during the stage of inserting, being fully inserted, staying in place, or pulling out, one incurs the full penalty. This would seem to be the basis for the Commentary’s warning in its discussion of the Vinīta-vatthu case in which a bhikkhu wakes up to find himself being sexually assaulted by a woman, gives her a kick, and sends her rolling. The warning: This is how a bhikkhu still subject to sensual lust should act if he wants to protect his state of mind.</td>
<td>总而言之，这些案例意味著，如果一个人受到性侵犯，只有在以下情况下才可以完全免除犯戒：（1）一个人在行为过程中的任何时候都没有心理上同意，或者（2）一个人至少在行为过程中的某部份确实感到心理上的同意，但奋力挣扎避免以任何方式透过身体或口头表达同意。（如《义注》中所指出的，从<a class="reference external" href="#pr2">《波罗夷》二</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中得出一条一般原则，仅在心理上同意而没有身体表达，不足以算作犯戒的一个因素，因为仅仅在想法或心理状态中产生并不构成犯戒。）如果一个人没有做出任何挣扎并感到精神上同意，即使只是在插入、完全插入、留在原处或拔出阶段短暂地发生，也会受到全额惩罚。这似乎是《义注》在讨论《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》的例子时发出警告的基础，在该案例中，一名比丘醒来，发现自己遭到一名女人的性侵犯，踢了她一脚，然后让她滚出去。警告：如果一个比丘仍然受制于色欲，他想要保护他的心境，就应该这样做。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu with “impaired faculties”—one who feels neither pleasure nor pain during intercourse—engages in intercourse under the assumption that his impairment exempts him from the rule. The case is brought to the Buddha, who states, “Whether this worthless man did or didn’t feel [anything], it is a case involving defeat.” From this ruling it can be argued that a bhikkhu indulging in intercourse as part of a tantric ritual incurs the full penalty even if he doesn’t feel pleasure in the course of the act.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中记载了一个案例，一位「官能受损」的比丘——在性交时既感觉不到快乐也感觉不到痛苦——认为他的缺陷使他不受戒条约束而进行性交。这个案例被提交给佛陀，佛陀说：“无论这个愚痴人有没有（任何）感觉，这都是一个《波罗夷》的案例。” 从这个裁决可以看出，一个比丘在密宗仪式中沉溺于性交，即使他在行为过程中没有感到快乐，也会受到全额惩罚。</td>

<tr><td>Two thullaccaya offenses are directly related to this rule. The first is for mouth-to-mouth penetration— i.e., the act of inserting any part of one’s mouth into the mouth of another person, or consenting to the insertion of another person’s mouth in one’s own—regardless of whether the other person is a man, a woman, or a common animal. When this act occurs under the influence of lust, as in an intense kiss, the thullaccaya here would be incurred in addition to whatever penalty is assigned for lustful bodily contact under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>.</td>
<td>两种《偷兰遮》罪与此戒条直接相关。第一种是口对口插入－即将一个人的嘴的任何部分插入另一个人的嘴里，或同意另一个人的嘴插入自己的嘴里的行为－无论对方是否是一个男人，女人，或普通的动物。当这种行为在性欲的影响下发生时，例如在激烈的接吻中，除了根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>对出于性欲的身体接触所规定的惩罚之外，还会犯《偷兰遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The second thullaccaya is for the unlikely case of a bhikkhu who attempts intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse. To attempt intercourse with any other part of a dead body or with any part of an insentient object, such as an inflatable doll or mannequin, incurs a dukkaṭa. (If this led to an ejaculation, however, the case would be treated under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>.)</td>
<td>第二种《偷兰遮》是针对一个不太可能发生的情况，即比丘试图与尸体腐烂的嘴巴、肛门或生殖器性交。试著与尸体的任何其他部分或无知觉物体的任何部位（例如充气娃娃或人体模型）进行性交，都会犯《突吉罗》。（但是，如果这导致射精，则该情况将根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧残》一</a>进行处理。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a> for intentional ejaculation or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> for lustful bodily contact. As we shall see below, the penalties assigned in the latter case are as follows: if the partner is a woman, a saṅghādisesa; if a <em>paṇḍaka</em> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>), a thullaccaya; if a man or a common animal, a dukkaṭa. We can infer from the Vibhaṅga’s ruling here that if a bhikkhu has an orgasm while attempting intercourse with the decomposed mouth, anus, or genitals of a corpse, with any other part of a dead body, or with any part of an insentient object, the case would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，如果比丘试图与除三孔穴之外的众生身体的任何部位发生性交，这种情况就属于《僧残》戒条－若非<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧残》一</a>代表故意射精，则为<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>代表出于性欲的身体接触。正如我们将在下面看到的，后一种情况的惩罚如下：如果对象是女人，《僧残》；如果是<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/p/pa%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Daka/">黄门</a> <em>paṇḍaka</em> （参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>），《偷兰遮》；如果是男人或普通动物，《突吉罗》。在此我们可以从《经分别》的裁决中推断出，如果一个比丘在尝试与尸体腐烂的嘴、肛门或生殖器，或与尸体的任何其他部分，或与无知觉物体的任何部分性交时获得性高潮，该情况属于<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧残》一</a>。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary disagrees with the Vibhaṅga on these points, however, saying that the derived offenses under this rule can include only dukkaṭa and thullaccaya penalties. In its explanation of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>, it sets forth a system of eleven types of lust in which the lust for the pleasure of bringing about an ejaculation, lust for the pleasure of bodily contact, and lust for the pleasure of intercourse are treated as completely separate things that must be treated under separate rules. Thus, it says, if a bhikkhu aiming at intercourse takes hold of a woman’s body, it is simply a preliminary to intercourse and thus entails only a dukkaṭa, rather than a saṅghādisesa for lustful bodily contact. Similarly, if he has a premature ejaculation before beginning intercourse, there is no offense at all.</td>
<td>然而，《义注》在这些观点上不同意《经分别》，称此戒条衍生的违犯只能包括《突吉罗》和《偷兰遮》惩罚。在对<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧残》一</a>的解释中，它提出了十一种性欲的系统，其中对射精快感的性欲，对身体接触快感的性欲，和对性交快感的性欲被视为完全不同的事情，必须根据不同的戒条处理。因此，它说，如果一个以性交为目的的比丘抓住了一个女人的身体，这只是性交的一个预备行动，因此只犯《突吉罗》，而不是出于性欲身体接触的《僧残》。同样地，如果他在开始性交之前出现早泄，也没有任何犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>These are fine academic distinctions and are clearly motivated by a desire to draw neat lines between the rules, but they lead to practical problems. As the Commentary itself points out, if a bhikkhu commits an act that falls near the borderline between these rules but cannot later report precisely which type of lust he was feeling in the heat of the moment, there is no way his case can be judged and a penalty assigned. At any rate, though, there is no basis in the Canon for the Commentary’s system, and in fact it contradicts not only the Vibhaṅga’s ruling mentioned above, but also its definition of <em>lustful</em> under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg3">3</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg4">4</a>, which is exactly the same for all three rules and places no limits on the type of lust involved. All of this leads to the conclusion that the Commentary’s neat system for classifying lust is invalid, and that the Vibhaṅga’s judgment holds: If a bhikkhu attempts intercourse with any part of a living being’s body apart from the three orifices, the case falls under the saṅghādisesa rules—either <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a> for intentional ejaculation or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> for lustful bodily contact—rather than here.</td>
<td>这些都是很好的学术区别，显然是出于希望在戒条之间划清界线的动机，但它们会导致实际问题。正如《义注》本身指出的那样，如果比丘所犯下的行为接近这些戒条的边缘，但后来无法准确地报告他在一时冲动中感受到哪种类型的欲望，那么他的情况就无法判断并给予惩罚。但，无论如何，《义注》的系统在《圣典》中是没有任何依据的，事实上，它不仅与上述《经分别》的裁决相矛盾，而且也与在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg3">三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg4">四</a>中对<em>性欲</em>的定义相矛盾，这个定义在所有三个戒条都是相同的，并且对所涉及的性欲类型没有限制。这一切都得出这样的结论：《义注》对性欲进行分类的简洁工整系统是无效的，而《经分别》的判断是成立的：如果比丘试图与除三孔穴之外的众生身体的任何部分进行交合，那么这种情况就属于《僧残》戒条的范畴－若非<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">《僧残》一</a>代表故意射精，则为<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">《僧残》二</a>代表出于性欲的身体接触－而不是这里。</td>

<tr><td>In addition to bhikkhus who do not know they are being assaulted or do not give their consent when they do know, the Vibhaṅga states that there are four special categories of bhikkhus exempted from a penalty under this rule: any bhikkhu who is insane, possessed by spirits, delirious with pain, or the first offender(s) (in this case, Ven. Sudinna and the bhikkhu with the monkey) whose actions prompted the Buddha to formulate the rule. The Commentary defines as <em>insane</em> anyone who “goes about in an unseemly way, with deranged perceptions, having cast away all sense of shame and compunction, not knowing whether he has transgressed major or minor training rules.” It recognizes this as a medical condition, which it blames on the bile. A bhikkhu under the influence of a severe psychosis-inducing drug would apparently fall under this exemption, but one under the influence of a more common intoxicant would not. As for spirit possession, the Commentary says that this can happen either when spirits frighten one or when, by distracting one with sensory images, they insert their hands into one’s heart by way of one’s mouth (!). Whatever the cause, it notes that insane and possessed bhikkhus are exempt from penalties they incur only when their perceptions are deranged (“when their mindfulness is entirely forgotten and they don’t know what fire, gold, excrement, and sandalwood are”) and not from any they incur during their lucid moments. As for a bhikkhu delirious with pain, he is exempt from penalties he incurs only during periods when the pain is so great that he does not know what he is doing.</td>
<td>除了不知道自己受到侵犯或明知后不同意的比丘外，《经分别》指出，有四种特殊类别的比丘可免受此戒条的处罚：任何精神错乱的比丘、被附身、或因痛苦而发狂神智不清，或最初犯戒者（在本例中，是须提那尊者和与猴子在一起的比丘），他们的行为促使佛陀制定了戒条。《义注》将<em>精神错乱</em>定义为「行为不得体，知觉错乱，已抛弃所有惭愧感，不知犯大、小学处」的人。它认为这是一种健康状况，并将其归咎于胆汁。受到严重的诱发精神病药物影响的比丘显然属于这里的豁免范围，但受到更常见的麻醉剂影响的比丘则不然。至于附身，《义注》说，这种情况可能发生在灵体吓唬人的时候，或者当灵体通过感官图像分散人的注意力，通过人的嘴将手插入人的心脏时（！）。无论出于什么原因，它指出，精神错乱和被附身的比丘只有在他们的知觉错乱时（“当他们的正念完全被遗忘，并且他们不知道火，金，粪便和檀香是什么时”）才可以免受惩罚，在清醒时所发生则不能豁免。至于因痛苦而发狂神智不清的比丘，只有当疼痛剧烈到他不知道自己在做什么时，他才可以免于惩罚。<!-- https://deerpark.app/reader/X0709/2

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if people are guarding an object as the property of a location—for example, an offering to a Buddha image, cetiya, or other sacred place—the object would also qualify as “not given” under this rule.

Nevertheless, the Commentary’s judgment on this point reflects a custom that had become widespread by its time, that of giving valuable items to a cetiya (this includes Buddha images) and dedicating them not to the Saṅgha but to the cetiya. Some medieval Indian Buddhist inscriptions express the idea that the cetiya or the Buddha relics (if any) within the cetiya actually own such objects, but the Commentary states that these objects have an owner simply in the sense that human beings are watching over them for the purpose of the cetiya. The jewels decorating the reliquary of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy or the offerings to the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok, for example, would fall under this category. According to the Commentary, the Saṅgha is duty-bound to care for such items but has no rights of ownership over them. In its discussion both of this rule and of Pv.XIX, it states that items given to the Saṅgha may be used for the purpose of the cetiya—for example, to contribute to its decoration or upkeep—but items given to the cetiya may not be used for the purpose of the Saṅgha.</td>

<tr><td>From the Commentary’s discussion of this type of ownership, it would appear that if there are no longer any human beings watching over a cetiya, the items donated to it would no longer count as having an owner and thus could be removed for safekeeping, preferably to another cetiya. Any bhikkhu who took such items for himself, however, would be risking the wrath of the devas who might be guarding the cetiya. This is why it is traditional in such cases to conduct a ceremony formally requesting the permission of any guardian devas, at the same time promising not to take such items for one’s own use.</td>

If it contains just thread, and he returns it to its place, he commits no offense. If, however, the bhikkhu takes the sack thinking, “I’ll steal whatever is in the sack,” the Commentary maintains that he is not guilty of stealing until he finds out what the sack contains and then picks it up again, but this case does not really fit under this category, as the bhikkhu has actually placed no condition on the article and so stole it when he first picked it up.</td>
<td>《义注》讨论了带有条件意图<em>（parikappāvahāra）</em>拿取物品的两种情况：对物品设定条件，以及对地点设定条件。它用一个比丘的例子来说明第一个情况，他进入一个黑暗的储藏室，拿起一袋装满物品的袋子，心想：「如果袋子里有布，我就偷它；如果它只包含线，我不偷。」在这种情况下，如果袋子里确实装有布，那么当比丘把袋子从原来的位置移开时，它就被偷了（见下文）。如果里面只有线，他把它放回原处，他就没有犯戒。然而，如果比丘拿起袋子时心里想：「我要偷袋子里的东西」，《义注》认为，在他发现袋子里装著什么，然后再把它拿起来之前，他并没有犯偷窃，但这个情况并不真正属于这一类，因为比丘实际上没有对这个物品设定任何条件，所以当他第一次拿起它时就偷走了它。</td>

<td><em>对地点设定条件</em>意味著心想：「如果我可以带著这个物品通过某某地点（例如出入口），我就会偷它；如果有人先看到我，我会假装我只是在看它，把它放回原处。」由于第一次拿起物品时并没有明确决定要偷窃，只有当拿物品通过了决意的地点时才算偷窃。</td>

The Commentary notes that this definition applies only to cases where the owners have not asked one to carry the article for them. Neither the Commentary nor the Sub-commentary explains this condition, but a possible reason might be that if they have asked a bhikkhu to carry the article for them, without their intending for him to give it to someone else, it would count as guarded by him or deposited with him for safe keeping, and thus would fall under another category. If, on the other hand, they asked him to carry the object to give to someone else and he decided to take it for himself, the case would come under Deceit, discussed below.</td>

<tr><td>The discussion in the Commentary and Sub-commentary indicates that the two categories of “objects a bhikkhu has been asked to guard,” and “objects deposited with a bhikkhu for safe keeping” differ in that in the latter case the object has been handed to the bhikkhu, whereas in the former it hasn’t. This, however, does not fit with the Vibhaṅga, which in defining “deposited” uses the word <em>upanikkhitaṁ</em>, which in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">NP 18</a> means “placed down next to.” A way to distinguish the two categories more closely in line with the Vibhaṅga would be to say that, in the latter case, the object is in such a location that the owner, in order to retrieve it, would have to ask the bhikkhu’s permission to do so, whereas in the former he/she wouldn’t. For example, an item placed in the bhikkhu’s hut or a monastery storeroom would count as deposited with the bhikkhu—regardless of whether it had been handed to him—whereas an item set by the side of a public road—with the bhikkhu simply asked to watch over it for a short period of time—would count as an object he has been asked to guard.</td>
<td>《义注》和《复注》中的讨论表明，「比丘被要求看守的物品」和「存放给比丘妥善保管的物品」这两类的不同之处在于，在后一种情况下，该物品已被交给比丘，而前者却没有。然而，这与《经分别》不符，《经分别》在定义「存放」时使用了「<em>upanikkhitaṁ</em>」一词，在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">《舍堕》一八</a>中意思是「放置在旁边」。一种更符合《经分别》的区分这两个类别的方法是，在后一种情况下，物品所在的位置使得所有者为了取回它，必须征求比丘的许可取回，而在前者中他/她不必。例如，放置在比丘小屋（孤邸）或寺院储藏室中的物品将被视为存放在比丘那里——无论它是否已交给他——而放置在公共道路旁的物品——比丘只被要求短时间看管——就算是被要求看守的物品。<!-- TODO FIXME: replace link to 《舍堕》一八 -->

The Vinaya-mukha notes that this contradicts the preceding definition of how one takes a piece of land, as the owner might not even know that the marker had been moved, and would not necessarily give up ownership even if he/she saw a bhikkhu moving it. The Sub-commentary tries to explain the discrepancy by maintaining that shifting a boundary marker fulfills the factor of effort here only if the act of shifting the marker, in and of itself, induces the owner to give up any efforts to reclaim the land, but that would make this category superfluous. A better explanation would be that this definition of taking applies to attempts to lay claim to Saṅgha land, for otherwise—if land can be stolen only when the owner abandons ownership—then Saṅgha land could not be stolen, because there is no one acting for the Saṅgha of the Four Directions who could renounce once and for all any efforts to reclaim the land.</td>
<td><em>移动界碑：</em>一块土地。《戒律入口》指出，这与前面关于如何「拿取」一块土地的定义相矛盾，因为所有者甚至可能不知道界碑已被移动，即使他/她看到比丘移动，也不一定会放弃所有权。《复注》试图解释这种差异，认为只有当移动界碑的行为本身导致所有者放弃任何收回土地的努力时，移动界碑才满足此处的努力因素，但这将使这个类别变得多余。更好的解释是，这种「拿取」的定义适用于试图声称拥有僧伽土地所有权，否则——如果土地只有在所有者放弃所有权时才能被盗——那么僧伽土地就不可能被盗，因为没有人可以代表四方僧伽一劳永逸地放弃任何收回土地的努力。</td>

<tr><td>Of these various ways of taking, the Commentary devotes the most space to the first, “moving the object from its place.” Its discussion is at odds with the Canon on many points, most notably in striking out the separate categories for taking large objects from a container (removing it entirely from the mouth of a container) and boats (causing them to move a hair-breadth upstream, downstream, or across a body of water), and simply subsuming them under this category. Although it may have regarded these separate categories as arbitrary, it introduces many arbitrary distinctions and inconsistencies of its own. Apparently its distinctions come from the ancient commentaries, for even Buddhaghosa expresses despair at trying to commit them all to writing. Here we will stick with the Canon’s scheme for defining the act of taking, and focus on the parts of the Commentary’s discussion that accord with the Canon. As for those that deviate from the Canon, only important deviations will be noted.</td>
<td>在这些不同的「拿取」方式中，《义注》用了最多的篇幅来描述第一种，「将物品从原来的位置移动」。它的讨论在许多方面与《圣典》不一致，最值得注意的是，删除了从容器中拿取大型物体（将其完全从容器口取出）和船只（导致它们向上游、下游或穿过水体移动毫发宽度）的单独类别，并单纯地将它们归入此类别。尽管它可能认为这些单独的类别是随意的，但它自己却引入了许多随意的区分和不一致。显然，它的区分来自古代注释，因为即使是<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>也对试图将它们全部写入文字表示绝望。这里我们将坚持《圣典》定义「拿取」行为的方案，并著重在《义注》中符合《圣典》的部分。至于那些偏离《圣典》的内容，只会指出重要的偏差。</td>

<tr><td>In general, the Commentary defines an object’s place in terms of the directions in which it can be moved: up, down (as when an object sitting on sand can be pushed down into the sand), left, right, forward (toward the person taking it), and away. With reference to the last five of these actions, the place of the object is defined in three-dimensional terms: the space it occupies. Thus to take an object in any of these directions, one must push or pull it entirely outside of the coordinates of the space it initially occupied. However, with reference to lifting the object up, the place is defined in two-dimensional terms: the area of contact between the object and its support, whether that support is another object or the ground. Thus to take an object by lifting it, one only need lift it a hairbreadth from its support.</td>
<td>总体来说，《义注》根据物体可以被移动的方向来定义物体的位置：上、下（如当坐在沙上的物体可以被推入沙子时）、左、右、前进（朝向拿取者），和远离。关于这些动作中的最后五个，物体的位置是用三维术语定义的：它所占据的空间。因此，要沿著这些方向中的任何一个方向拿取物体，必须将其完全推或拉到其最初占据的空间座标之外。然而，关于举起物体，该位置是用二维术语定义的：物体与其支撑物之间的接触面积，无论该支撑物是另一个物体还是地面。因此，要举起一个物体来拿取，只需将其从支撑物上举起毫发宽度即可。</td>

<tr><td>Because objects in the air have no support, the Commentary defines their space in three-dimensional terms no matter which direction they are moved. For instance, if one catches a piece of cloth being blown by the wind, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment one catches it. If one stops a flying peacock without touching it, its place is the three-dimensional space it occupies at the moment it stops to hover. In either case, the object is taken when displaced any direction outside the coordinates of that space. In the case of the cloth, this could be done simply by dropping it. In the case of the peacock, it could be done by waving one’s hands and getting it to fly in the desired direction. If the peacock happens to land on one’s arm, it is taken when one moves it to another part of one’s body or puts it down.</td>
<td>由于空气中的物体没有支撑，因此无论它们被向哪个方向移动，《义注》都以三维术语定义它们的空间。比如说，如果你抓住一块被风吹动的布，它所在的位置就是一个人在抓住它的那一刻所占据的三维空间。如果一个人停止一只飞翔的孔雀而不触碰它，那么它所在的位置就是它停止盘旋那一刻所占据的三维空间。在任何一种情况下，当物体被移位到在该空间的座标之外的任何方向时，就算被拿取。就布料而言，只需将其掉落就算完成拿取。就孔雀而言，只需挥动双手，让它朝著想要的方向飞去就算完成拿取。如果孔雀刚好落在一个人的手臂上，当一个人将它移到身体的另一个部位或将它放下时，就算被拿取。</td>

If one is stealing the person’s clothes, they are taken only when removed from his/her body. If the person, stripped of the clothes, is still holding onto them, they are taken only when pulled from his/her hand.</td>
<td>活人身上的物体（例如人手臂上的手镯）以人的身体作为其位置。因此，如果在试图取下手镯时，将其在手臂上下拉动，则手镯尚未被拿取。只有当一个人将手镯完全从手中拿开时，才算被拿取。如果有人偷了某人的衣服，只有当衣服从他/她身上脱下来时才算被拿取。如果被剥去衣服的人仍然抓著衣服，只有从他/她的手中拉出衣服时，衣服才算被拿取。</td>

<tr><td>For some objects, the Commentary defines <em>place</em> in terms that seem rather arbitrary. For instance, a robe on a line is taken when it is lifted a hairbreadth off the line, but for some reason if it is moved along the line it is not taken until it is ten or twelve fingerbreadths away from the area it originally occupied on the line. An object leaning against a wall has two places: the spot where it sits on the ground and the spot it touches on the wall. A vehicle’s place is defined two-dimensionally: the spots where its wheels touch the ground (perhaps this is defined on analogy with the feet of an animal). An object tied to a post has that connection as an extra part of its place. Thus a pot tied by a chain to a post is not taken until it is removed from the area it occupied under the general definition above <em>and</em> either the chain is cut or the post pulled up. Although there is a certain logic to each of these cases, the added distinctions seem unnecessary complications added to an already complicated issue. For simplicity’s sake there would seem every reason to stick with the general definition of place even in these special cases, although there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove or disprove the Commentary here.</td>
<td>对于某些物体，《义注》对<em>位置</em>的定义似乎相当随意。例如，当一条线上的袈裟被提高离该线一毫发宽度时，它就算被拿取，但由于某种原因，如果它沿著该线被移动，直到它距离它在该线上原来占据的区域十或十二个手指宽度时，它才算被拿取。靠在墙上的物体有两个位置：它位于地面上的位置和它接触墙壁的位置。车辆的位置是二维定义的：车轮接触地面的点（也许这是透过类比动物的脚来定义的）。绑在柱子上的物体将该连接作为其位置的额外部分。因此，用链条绑在柱子上的罐子不算被拿取，直到将其从根据上面一般定义的所占据区域移开<em>并且</em>链条被切断或柱子被拔起为止。尽管每种情况都有一定的逻辑，但增加的差异似乎为本已复杂的问题增添了不必要的复杂性。为了简单起见，即使在这些特殊情况下，似乎也有充分的理由坚持位置的一般定义，尽管《经分别》中没有任何内容可以证明或反驳这里的《义注》。</td>

<tr><td>However, as noted above, several of the Commentary’s definitions of <em>place</em> clearly contradict the Vibhaṅga. In some cases, the contradiction is simple, as when the Commentary insists that an animal kept in an enclosure—a cow in a pen, a peacock in a garden—is taken not when its feet are moved, but only when removed from the enclosure. In other cases, the contradiction is more complex, in that the Commentary tries to define <em>taking</em> as “moving the object from its place” in cases where the Vibhaṅga defines the act of taking in other terms. For example, with an object sitting in the bottom of a container, it says that the object is taken when lifted a hairbreadth from the bottom, there being no need to remove the object from the container before it is considered taken. In the case of a boat, the Commentary defines the place of the boat in modified three-dimensional terms: the entire space where the boat displaces water. To take it by pushing it down in the water, the top of the boat has to sink lower than the level where the keel originally was; to take it by lifting it up, one need only lift it a hairbreadth above the water, there being no need to lift the keel to a point higher than where the highest point of the boat was. However, because the Vibhaṅga does not define the taking of boats or objects in containers in terms of “moving the object from its place,” the Commentary’s analysis of these possibilities is beside the point.</td>
<td>然而，如上所述，《义注》中对<em>位置</em>的一些定义显然与《经分别》相矛盾。在某些情况下，矛盾很简单，例如当《义注》坚持认为饲养在围起来的区域中的动物（围栏中的牛，花园中的孔雀）不是在其脚移动时才被拿取，而是只有在从围起来的区域中移出时才被拿取。在其他情况下，矛盾更为复杂，因为《义注》试图将「<em>拿取</em>」定义为「将物品从原来的位置移动」，而《经分别》以其他术语定义「拿取」的行为。例如，如果一个物体位于容器的底部，它说该物体从底部抬起一毫发宽度时就被拿取了，在该物体被视为拿取之前，不需要将其从容器中取出。就船只的情况而言，《义注》以修改后的三维术语定义了船只的位置：船排开水的整个空间。为了透过将其推入水中来拿取它，船的顶部必须下沉到低于船的龙骨原来所在的水平；为了透过举起来拿取它，只需将其举出水面一毫发宽度即可，无需将龙骨举得高于船之前的最高点。然而，由于《经分别》并没有将拿取船只或容器中的物体定义为「将物品从原来的位置移动」，因此《义注》对这些可能性的分析是不是重点，与主题无关。</td>

The Vibhaṅga offers no further explanation, but the Commentary states that the taking can be accomplished in various ways. If, after the drawing of the tickets, X puts his ticket in the place of Y’s ticket before picking up Y’s, the taking is accomplished when he picks up Y’s. If he picks up Y’s before putting his own ticket in its place, the taking is accomplished when he lets go of his own. If both tickets don’t appear (they’ve been concealed?) and X gets Y to take X’s portion, the taking is accomplished when he then picks up Y’s portion. The underlying assumption in all this is that Y’s portion belongs to him as soon as he has drawn the ticket for it. The Commentary adds that this exchange counts as theft regardless of whether X’s portion is worth more than Y’s, less than Y’s, or the two portions are of equal value.</td>
<td><em>a. 诈骗：</em>物品以抽签的方式分发给僧团，一个比丘理应拿取的部份却到了另一个比丘那里。《经分别》没有提供进一步的解释，但《义注》指出，可以透过多种方式完成拿取。如果在抽签后，X 在拿取 Y 的签之前，将自己的签放在 Y 的签的位置上，则当他拿取 Y 的签时，即完成拿取。如果他在将自己的签放回原来的位置之前拿起 Y 的签，那么当他放开自己的签时，就完成了拿取。如果两张签都没有出现（它们被隐藏了？）并且 X 让 Y 拿走了 X 的部分，那么当他拿起 Y 的部分时，拿取就完成了。所有这一切的基本假设是，一旦 Y 抽出签，Y 的部分就属于 Y 了。《义注》补充说，无论 X 的部分价值高于 Y 的价值、低于 Y 的价值，还是两部分价值相等，这种交换都算是窃盗。</td>

<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu states that there is no penalty if the bhikkhu goes through customs not knowing that he has an item subject to import duties among his effects. The relevant cases show that this can mean one of two things: Either he knows that he has the item with him but not that it is subject to import duties; or he does not know that he has the item with him at all. The Commentary adds that if a bhikkhu informs the customs official that he has an item subject to import duties and yet the official decides not to collect the duty, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. It also states that if a bhikkhu goes through customs with a conditional intent—“If they ask to see my belongings, I’ll pay the fee, but if they wave me through I won’t”—then if the officials do wave him through without asking to see his belongings, he incurs no offense. At present, when people entering a country are asked to choose different passageways through a customs area, marked “Goods to declare” and “Nothing to declare,” a bhikkhu with goods to declare who enters the “Nothing to declare” passageway cannot take advantage of this allowance for conditional intent, as he has already indicated an unconditional intent through his choice of a passageway.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that if, to avoid paying an import duty at a frontier, one crosses the frontier in such a way as to evade the customs area (§), one incurs only a dukkaṭa. At present, the civil law judges this sort of behavior as more reprehensible than slipping an item through customs, but from the point of view of the Vinaya the lesser penalty still holds. The Commentary says that this allowance applies only in cases when one evades the customs area by a distance of more than two leḍḍupātas—approximately 36 meters. (A leḍḍupāta is a unit of measure that appears frequently in the Canon and is defined as the distance a man of average stature can throw a clod of dirt underarm.)</td>
<td>《经分别》说，如果为了避免在边境缴纳进口关税，而以逃避关税区（§）的方式跨越边境，则只会犯《突吉罗》。目前，民法认为这种行为比偷渡物品更应受到谴责，但从戒律的角度来看，仍应受到较轻的惩罚。《义注》称，这项开缘仅适用于逃避海关区域距离超过 2 个 leḍḍupāta（约 36 公尺）的情况。（ <em>leḍḍupāta</em> 是一种在《圣典》中经常出现的测量单位，被定义为中等身材的人将一块泥土用低手丢掷而出的距离。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga’s position here is important to understand, for it has implications concerning the extent to which the evasion of other government fees and taxes would fall under this rule. The underlying assumption here seems to be that a dutiable item carried into a customs area is impounded by the king (or government). The payment of the duty is thus an act of recovering full ownership of the item. An item carried across the frontier without entering the customs area would not count as impounded, even though the king would probably claim the right to impound or even confiscate it if his agents apprehended the smuggler. Translated into modern terms, this would indicate that the evasion of other taxes claimed by the government—such as inheritance taxes—would incur the full penalty here only if the item being taxed was impounded on government property, and one evaded the tax by taking the item out of impoundment without paying the required fee. Otherwise, the penalty for tax evasion would be a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>理解《经分别》在此的立场很重要，因为它涉及到逃避其他政府费用和税收在多大程度上属于此戒条的范围。这里的基本假设似乎是，带入海关区域的应税物品被国王（或政府）扣押。因此，缴纳关税是恢复该物品的全部所有权的行为。未进入海关区域而跨越边境的物品不会被视为被扣押，尽管如果国王的特工逮捕了走私者，国王可能会声称有权扣押甚至没收该物品。用现代术语来说，这表明，逃避政府征收的其他税款（例如遗产税），只有当征税物品被扣押在政府财产上，并且在未缴纳规定费用的情况下将物品从扣押中取出来逃税时，才会受到全额惩罚。否则，对逃税的惩罚是《突吉罗》。</td>

<tr><td>None of the texts discuss the question of contraband, i.e., articles that a customs official would confiscate outright rather than allow into a country after the payment of a fee. Apparently, such goods smuggled through a customs house would fall into this category, although—as even the payment of a fee would not legally get them through customs—their selling value would be the determining factor in calculating the seriousness of the offense.</td>
<td>这些文本都没有讨论违禁品问题，即海关官员在支付费用后会直接没收而不是允许入境的物品。显然，透过海关走私，即使支付费用也不能合法地通过海关的货物属于这一类，而它们的售价将成为计算犯戒严重性的决定性因素。</td>

Ajjuka sees that the nephew has the greater faith and so shows the place of the treasure to him. The nephew awards the Saṅgha with a large donation; the son accuses Ven. Ajjuka of having wrongfully deprived him of his rightful inheritance. On hearing this, Ven. Ānanda first accuses Ven. Ajjuka of a pārājika, but when the wealthy man’s wishes are revealed, Ven.

<tr><td>None of the texts discuss the details of this case, which seems to have postdated the Buddha’s parinibbāna. The apparent assumption underlying the ruling is that when X dies, the inheritance he leaves to Y belongs to Y from the moment of X’s death. Otherwise, the items in question would be ownerless until apportioned out among the heirs, and thus would not fulfill the factor of object under this rule. Also, the taking in this case would be accomplished in line with the Vibhaṅga’s standard definition for <em>taking</em> with regard to the objects involved—and not necessarily when the cheated heir gives up trying to reclaim the inheritance—for in Ven. Ajjuka’s case Ven. Ānanda was ready to impose a pārājika even though the son had not abandoned his claim.</td>
<td>没有任何文本讨论这个案例的细节，这似乎是在佛陀般涅槃之后发生的。该裁决背后的明显假设是，当 X 死亡时，他留给 Y 的遗产从 X 死亡那一刻起就属于 Y。否则，相关物品在分配给继承人之前将是无主的，因此不符合本戒条下的对象因素。此外，在这种情况下，「拿取」将按照《经分别》对所涉及对象的<em>拿取</em>标准定义来完成－而不一定是当被欺骗的继承人放弃试图收回遗产时－因为在阿酬尊者的案例中，尽管儿子并没有放弃声称拥有，阿难尊者已经准备好施加《波罗夷》了。</td>

<tr><td><em>d. Destruction of property:</em> The Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu breaks, scatters, burns, or otherwise renders unusable the property of another person, he incurs a dukkaṭa. Thus the simple destruction of property does not fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. The Vinīta-vatthu contains a case in which a bhikkhu intends to steal some grass belonging to the Community but ends up setting fire to it instead, thus incurring a dukkaṭa. The Commentary notes that this ruling applies only because the bhikkhu did not move the grass from its place. What this means is that if he had first taken the grass from its place and then destroyed it in any way, the factor of effort under this rule would have been fulfilled and—all other factors of a pārājika offense being present—he would have been guilty of the full offense.</td>
<td><em>d. 毁损财物：</em>《经分别》说，如果比丘破坏、散落、焚烧或以其他方式使他人的财产无法使用，他犯《突吉罗》。因此，单纯地破坏财产并不能满足此戒条下的努力因素。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中记载了一个案例，一名比丘打算偷一些属于僧团的草，但结果却放火烧了它，从而犯《突吉罗》。《义注》指出，这项裁决适用仅因比丘没有将草移离原处的情况。这意味著，如果他首先将草从原处上拿走，然后以任何方式摧毁它，则此戒条下的努力因素将被满足，并且－《波罗夷》违犯的所有其他因素都存在－他将完全违犯此戒。</td>

<tr><td>As stated above, any case of stealing counts as an offense, but the gravity of the offense is determined by the value of the object. This is the point of the phrase in the rule reading, “just as when there is the taking of what is not given, kings… would banish him, saying… ‘You are a thief.’” In other words, for a theft to entail a pārājika it must be a criminal case, which in the time of the Buddha meant that the goods involved were worth at least five <em>māsakas</em>, a unit of money used at the time. Goods valued collectively at more than one māsaka but less than five are grounds for a thullaccaya; goods valued collectively at one māsaka or less, grounds for a dukkaṭa. As the Commentary notes, the value of the articles is determined by the price they would have fetched at the time and place of the theft. As stated above, in the case of smuggling the Vibhaṅga measures the value of the object, for the purpose of this rule, as the duty owed on it, not the value of the object itself.</td>
<td>如上所述，任何偷窃行为都被视为犯戒，但犯戒的严重程度取决于对象物品的价值。这就是戒条中这句话的要点，「就像当有人拿取未给予的东西时，国王......会驱逐他，说......『你是一个小偷。』」换句话说，窃盗行为涉及《波罗夷》的，一定是刑事犯罪案件，在佛陀时代，这意味著所涉及的货物至少价值 5 <em>摩沙迦</em>（当时使用的货币单位）。总价值超过 1 摩沙迦但低于 5 摩沙迦的商品，犯《偷兰遮》；总价值为 1 摩沙迦或更低的商品，犯《突吉罗》。正如《义注》指出的那样，物品的价值取决于它们在被偷的时间和地点的售价。如上所述，在走私的情况下，就本戒条而言，《经分别》是以对其所征收的关税作为物品的价值，而不是物品本身的价值。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This leaves us with the question of how a māsaka would translate into current monetary rates. No one can answer this question with any certainty, for the oldest attempt to peg the māsaka to the gold standard dates from the V/Sub-commentary, which sets one māsaka as equal to 4 rice grains’ weight of gold. At this rate, the theft of an item worth 20 rice grains’ (1/24 troy ounce) weight of gold or more would be a pārājika offense.</td>
<td>这给我们留下了一个问题：摩沙迦如何转换为当前的货币利率。没有人能够肯定地回答这个问题，因为将摩沙迦与金本位挂钩的最古老的尝试可以追溯到V/《复注》，其中将 1 摩沙迦等于 4 粒米重的黄金。按照这个利率，偷窃价值 20 粒米（1/24 <a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E8%A1%A1%E7%9B%8E%E5%8F%B8">金衡盎司</a>）黄金或更高将构成《波罗夷》罪。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One objection to this method of calculation is that some of the items mentioned in the Vinīta-vatthu as grounds for a pārājika when stolen—e.g., a pillow, a bundle of laundry, a raft, a handful of rice during a famine—would seem to be worth much less than 1/24 troy ounce of gold. However, we must remember that many items regarded as commonplace now may have been viewed as expensive luxuries at the time.</td>
<td>对这种计算方法的一个反对意见是，《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中提到的一些被偷时作为《波罗夷》依据的物品——例如，一个枕头、一捆衣物、一艘木筏、饥荒期间的一把米——其价值似乎远低于 1/24 金衡盎司黄金。然而，我们必须记住，许多现在被认为司空见惯的物品在当时可能被视为昂贵的奢侈品。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition, there is one very good reason for adopting the standard set by the V/Sub-commentary: It sets a high value for the least article whose theft would result in a pārājika. Thus when a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, there can be no doubt that he has committed the full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be inescapable doubt—and when there is any doubt concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt: He is not expelled. A basic principle operating throughout the texts is that it is better to risk letting an offender go unpunished than to risk punishing an innocent bhikkhu.</td>
<td>此外，采用V/《复注》设定的标准还有一个很好的理由：它为偷窃会导致《波罗夷》的最少物品设定了很高的价值。因此，当比丘偷窃价值 1/24 金衡盎司黄金或更高的物品时，毫无疑问他已经完全违犯此戒。当物品的价值较低时，就会不可避免地产生怀疑——当对《波罗夷》有任何疑问时，戒律的传统始终给予比丘以怀疑的好处：他不会被驱逐。贯穿整个文本的一个基本原则是，冒著让犯戒者不受惩罚的风险，比冒著惩罚无辜比丘的风险要好。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is a second advantage to the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation: its precision and clarity. Some people have recommended adopting the standard expressed in the rule itself—that if the theft would result in flogging, imprisonment, or banishment by the authorities in that time and at that place, then the theft would constitute a pārājika—but this standard creates more problems than it would solve. In most countries the sentence is largely at the discretion of the judge or magistrate, and the factor of value is only one among many taken into account when determining the penalty. This opens a whole Pandora’s box of issues, many of which have nothing to do with the bhikkhu or the object he has taken—the judge’s mood, his social philosophy, his religious background, and so forth—issues that the Buddha never allowed to enter into the consideration of how to determine the penalty for a theft.</td>
<td>V/《复注》的计算方法还有第二个优点：精确、清晰。有些人建议采用戒条本身所表达的标准，即如果偷窃行为会导致当时该地点的当局鞭打、监禁或流放，那么该偷窃行为就构成《波罗夷》，但这一标准产生的问题多于其解决的问题。在大多数国家，刑罚很大程度上由法官或治安官酌情决定，价值因素只是决定刑罚时考虑的众多因素之一。这就打开了整个潘朵拉魔盒的问题，其中许多问题与比丘或他所拿取的对象物品无关——法官的情绪、他的社会哲学、他的宗教背景等等——佛陀从未允许在对窃盗罪的刑罚如何确定时考虑的问题。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus the V/Sub-commentary’s method of calculation has the benefits that it is a quick and easy method for determining the boundaries between the different levels of offense in any modern currency; it involves no factors extraneous to the tradition of the Vinaya, and—as noted above—it draws the line at a value above which there can be no doubt that the penalty is a pārājika.</td>
<td>因此，V/《复注》的计算方法的优点是，它是一种快速、简单的方法，可以确定任何现代货币的不同犯戒程度之间的界限；它不涉及与戒律传统无关的因素，而且——如上所述——它划定了一个价值，高于这个价值，毫无疑问，惩罚就是《波罗夷》。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, arguing from two cases in the Vinīta-vatthu, states that if a bhikkhu steals several items on different occasions, the values of the different items are added together to determine the severity of the offense <em>only if they were stolen as part of a single plan or intention.</em> If they are stolen as a result of separate intentions, each act of stealing is treated as a separate offense whose severity depends on the value of the individual item(s) stolen in that act.

<tr><td>The commentaries state that when a heavier penalty is incurred in offenses of this sort, only that penalty is counted, and the preceding lighter ones are nullified. They derive this principle from a passage in the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">Sg 10-13</a> and, using the Great Standards, apply it to all the rules. Thus, for example, if a bhikkhu trying to steal a book simply touches it, he incurs a string of dukkaṭas for each step in walking up to the book and taking hold of it. If he budges the book slightly but not so much as to move it completely from its place, the dukkaṭas are nullified and replaced with a thullaccaya. If he actually takes the book, that nullifies the thullaccaya and replaces it with a pārājika.</td>
<td>注释指出，此类犯戒仅计算受到的较重惩罚，之前较轻的惩罚无效。他们从<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">《僧残》十到十三</a>的《经分别》中的一段经文中得出这一原则，并使用《四大教示》，将其应用于所有戒条。因此，举例来说，如果一个比丘试图偷一本书，仅仅只是触碰它，那么他走到这本书并抓住它的每一步，犯一连串《突吉罗》。如果他稍微移动这本书，但又没有完全移动它的位置，那么《突吉罗》就会失效，并被《偷兰遮》取代。如果他真的拿走了这本书，那么《偷兰遮》就会失效，并以《波罗夷》取而代之。</td>

They don’t mention it under any of the other saṅghādisesa rules or in the otherwise parallel passage in the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc68">Pc 68</a>. Thus, the principle seems intended only for those four rules. To be on the strict side, it seems best to say that, unless otherwise noted, a bhikkhu who completes an act must make amends for all the offenses incurred in leading up to it. Under the pārājika rules this is a moot point, for once the pārājika is committed the offender is no longer a bhikkhu. But under the lesser rules this principle is still relevant.</td>
<td>然而，关于《圣典》的编撰者是否打算将<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg10">《僧残》十到十三</a>中的段落视为一般原则，存在一些疑问。他们没有在任何其他《僧残》戒条下或在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc68">《波逸提》六八</a>的《经分别》其他类似的段落中提及它。因此，该原则似乎仅适用于这四个戒条。从严格的角度来看，最好的说法是，除非另有说明，完成某一行为的比丘必须弥补在该行为之前所造成的所有罪过。根据《波罗夷》戒条，这是一个有争议的问题，因为一旦犯了《波罗夷》，犯戒者就不再是比丘了。但在较小的戒条下，这项原则仍然适用。</td>

<tr><td>As for the derived offenses related to the factor of perception, these deal with the situation in which an article does not qualify as not given under this rule—e.g., it has no owner, or the owner has given it up or thrown it away—and yet the bhikkhu perceives it as not given. If he takes it with intent to steal, he incurs a dukkaṭa for each of the three stages of effort. In the case of an object that can be stolen by moving it from its place, these would be: touching the object, making it budge, moving it from its place. A similar set of offenses would apply in the stages appropriate for taking any of the other types of objects listed above.</td>
<td>至于与感知因素有关的衍生违犯，这些涉及的是不符合本戒条规定的物品的情况，例如，该物品没有所有者，或者所有者已将其放弃或扔掉——然而比丘认为它没有被给予。如果他出于偷窃的目的而取走它，他会因三个阶段中每一阶段的努力而犯一次《突吉罗》。如果物品可以透过将其从原来的位置移开而被偷，则这些阶段将是：触摸该物体，使其移动，将其移离原来的位置。类似的犯戒行为将适用于拿取上述任何其他类型物品的适当阶段。</td>

The same holds true if the instigator rescinds his order before the theft takes place, but the accomplice goes ahead and takes the object anyway.</td>

Conversely, if B takes X, thinking it to be Y, A is guilty of the theft.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga also notes that if an instigator tells his accomplice to take an item when he (the instigator) makes a sign—such as winking (§) his eye, lifting his eyebrow, or lifting his head—he incurs a dukkaṭa in making this order, a thullaccaya if the accomplice agrees to do as told, and the full offense when the accomplice actually takes the item at the time of the sign. If the accomplice takes the item before or after the sign, though, the instigator incurs no offense. The Sub-commentary, noting that the signs mentioned in the Vibhaṅga are so fleeting that it would be impossible to take the item at the very moment of the sign, interprets this last statement as follows: If the accomplice starts trying to take the item right after the sign, then regardless of how much time that takes, it counts as “at the time of the sign.” Only if he makes an appreciable delay before attempting the theft does it count as “after the sign.”</td>
<td>《经分别》还指出，如果教唆者告诉他的共犯在他（教唆者）做出示意动作时拿走一件物品——例如眨眼（§）、扬起眉毛或抬起头——他会在做这个命令动作时犯《突吉罗》，如果共犯同意按照指示行事，则为《偷兰遮》；如果共犯在示意动作时实际拿走了该物品，则构成完全犯戒。不过，如果共犯在示意动作之前或之后拿走物品，教唆者不犯戒。《复注》指出，《经分别》中提到的示意动作是如此短暂，以至于不可能在示意动作出现的那一刻拿走该物品，因此对最后的陈述解释如下：如果共犯在示意动作之后开始试图拿走该物品，无论花费多少时间，都算是「示意动作时」。只有当他在尝试偷窃之前明显延迟时，才算作「在示意动作之后」。</td>

Once D takes the object as instructed, all four incur the penalty coming from the theft. If there is any confusion in the chain of command—e.g., Bhikkhu B instead of telling C tells D directly—neither A nor C incurs the penalty for the theft itself. Bhikkhu A would incur a dukkaṭa for telling B, whereas C would incur no penalty at all.</td>

If he simply tells his accomplice that such-and-such an item is located in such-and-such a place and would be easy to steal, he incurs no penalty even if the accomplice actually commits the theft. This point applies to many of the rules in which giving a command to do an action that would break the rule would also fulfill the factor of effort: A statement counts as a command only if it is a clear imperative to do the action. Under the few rules where this is <em>not</em> the case, we will note the exception.</td>

Nevertheless, it would appear that if B then actually takes the item as told, all of the factors for an offense would be fulfilled for A: He gives the command to take (the imperative the Vibhaṅga uses in illustrating commands to “steal”—<em>avahara</em>—can also simply mean to “take”), he knows that the item belongs to someone else, he intends to have it taken, and it is taken as a result of his command. As for B, he would not be committing an offense, as his state of mind would not fulfill the factors of perception and intention for a theft.</td>

At most, such items may be taken on loan or exchanged—with the approval of the Community—for other heavy property of equal value.

This implies that if they were to take the fruit for other purposes—to have it sold, for instance—they would be guilty of an offense. The Commentary adds that visiting bhikkhus have this right only if the resident bhikkhus are not caring for the fruit trees, if the trees had not been donated to provide funds for a particular purpose in the monastery, or if the resident bhikkhus eat from the trees as if they alone were the owners and are not willing to share. In other words, the visiting bhikkhus, as a matter of courtesy, should ask the residents first. If the residents share, one may take what they offer. If they don’t, and the trees are not dedicated to another purpose, one may take just enough for one’s own consumption.

<td><em>欺诈。</em>如果比丘故意撒谎，欺骗他人给他某样东西，那么这种犯戒行为就不会被视为偷窃—因为毕竟该物品是被给予他的—而是被视为撒谎。如果谎言涉及虚假声称具有卓越的修行成就，则根据<a class="reference external" href="#pr4">《波罗夷》四</a>进行处理。如果不是，则根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>进行处理。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》给出了七个案例：五个案例中，在僧团中分发必需品期间，比丘为不存在的比丘索取额外的一份，并得到了额外的一份；另两个案例，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0088a04">一位比丘尼接近她老师的在家供养者并索取药物，并说这些药物是给她老师的</a>，尽管最终她自己使用了这些药物。在所有这些案例下，根据<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>，说谎的惩罚是《波逸提》。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, in its discussion of the bhikkhus taking an extra portion for a non-existent bhikkhu, insists that the penalty for lying applies only to cases where donors have already given the requisites to the Community. If, prior to their giving the requisites to the Community, a bhikkhu asks them directly for a portion for a non-existent bhikkhu, the Commentary says that he has committed a theft under this rule. This, however, contradicts the ruling in the two cases involving the bhikkhunī, who asks directly from the donor. Thus it would appear that in any case where a bhikkhu obtains an article from a donor through deceit, the penalty would be the pācittiya for lying.</td>
<td>《义注》在讨论比丘为一个不存在的比丘收取额外的份额时，坚持认为撒谎的惩罚只适用于布施者已经向僧团给予必需品的情况。如果在向僧团给予必需品之前，一位比丘直接向他们索取一位不存在的比丘的份额，《义注》说根据这条戒条，他犯了偷窃。然而，这与涉及直接向施主索取的比丘尼的两起案例的裁决相矛盾。因此，在任何情况下看来，当比丘透过欺诈手段从施主那里获得物品时，惩罚是因说谎的《波逸提》。</td>

<tr><td>The question arises, what about a bhikkhu who, given an item to take to someone else, originally plans to take it to the intended recipient but later changes his mind? It does not seem right to impose a heavier penalty on him than on a person who uses deceit to get the item to begin with, so it seems best to impose on him the dukkaṭa for a broken promise (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0050.html#Mv.III.14.4">Mv.III.14.1-14</a>—see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>).

</tr>
<tr><td><em>Receiving stolen goods.</em> Accepting a gift of goods or purchasing them very cheaply, knowing that they were stolen, would in Western criminal law result in a penalty similar to stealing itself. However, neither the Canon nor the commentaries mention this case. The closest they come is in the Vinīta-vatthu, where a groundskeeper gives bhikkhus fruit from the orchard under his care, even though it was not his to give, and there was no offense for the bhikkhus. From this it can be inferred that there is no offense for receiving stolen goods, even knowingly, although a bhikkhu who does so would not be exempt from the civil law and the consequent proceedings, in the course of which the Community would probably urge him to disrobe.</td>
<td><em>收受赃物。</em>在西方刑法中，接受商品礼物或以非常便宜的价格购买商品，而且明知这些商品是被偷的，将导致与偷窃本身类似的惩罚。然而，《圣典》和注释均未提及此种情况。最接近的地方是在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0086a14">园丁从他照管的果园里给予比丘们水果</a>，尽管这不是他的，却仍给予比丘们，而比丘们并没有犯戒。由此可以推断，收受赃物并不构成犯戒，即使在知情的情况下，尽管这样做的比丘不能免于民法和随后的诉讼，在此过程中，僧团可能会敦促他还俗。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Compensation owed.</em> The Commentary introduces the concept of <em>bhaṇḍadeyya</em>, or compensation owed, to cover cases where a bhikkhu is responsible for the loss or destruction of another person’s property. It defines this concept by saying that the bhikkhu must pay the price of the object to the owner or give the owner another object of equal value to the one lost or destroyed; if the bhikkhu does not give compensation, and the owner gives up his/her efforts to receive compensation, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika. The Commentary applies this concept not only to cases where the bhikkhu knowingly and intentionally destroys the object, but also to cases where he borrows or agrees to look after something that then gets lost, stolen, or destroyed through his negligence; or where he takes an item mistakenly thinking that it was discarded or that he was in a position to take it on trust.</td>
<td><em>所欠赔偿。</em>《义注》引入了 <em>bhaṇḍadeyya</em> （所欠赔偿）的概念，以涵盖比丘对他人财产的损失或毁坏负责的情况。它定义了这个概念，说比丘必须向所有者支付该物品的价格，或向所有者提供与丢失或毁坏的物品价值相同的另一件物品；如果比丘不给予补偿，并且所有者放弃了获得补偿的努力，那么比丘就会犯《波罗夷》。《义注》不仅将这个概念应用于比丘明知而故意毁坏物品的情况，也适用于他借用或同意看管某物，但由于他的疏忽而丢失、被盗或毁坏的情况；或者他拿走一件物品时，误认为该物品已被丢弃，或他可以基于信任拿走该物品。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>To cite a few examples: A bhikkhu breaks another person’s jar of oil or places excrement in the oil to spoil it. A bhikkhu charged with guarding the Community storeroom lets a group of other bhikkhus into the storeroom to fetch belongings they have left there; they forget to close the door and, before he remembers to check it, thieves slip in to steal things. A group of thieves steal a bundle of mangoes but, being chased by the owners, drop it and run; a bhikkhu sees the mangoes, thinks that they have been thrown away, and so eats them after getting someone to present them to him. A bhikkhu sees a wild boar caught in a trap and, out of compassion, sets it free but cannot reconcile the owner of the trap to what he has done. In each of these cases, the Commentary says, the bhikkhu in question owes compensation to the owner of the goods. (In the case of the mangoes, he must compensate not only the owners but also the thieves if it turns out that they had planned to come back and fetch the fruit.) If he abandons his responsibility to the owner(s), he incurs a pārājika.</td>
<td>举几个例子：一位比丘打碎了别人的油罐，或是把排泄物放入油中，毁掉了油。一位负责看守僧团储藏室的比丘让一群其他比丘进入储藏室取回他们留在那里的所有物；他们忘记关门，在他记得检查之前，小偷就溜进来偷东西了。一群小偷偷了一捆芒果，但被所有者追赶，丢下逃跑；一位比丘看到芒果，以为它们已被丢掉，于是请人将芒果手授给他后吃掉它们。一位比丘看到一头野猪被困在陷阱中，出于慈悲，将其释放，但无法让陷阱的主人接受他的所作所为。《义注》说，在上述每一种情况下，相关比丘都欠货物所有者赔偿。（就芒果而言，他不仅必须赔偿所有者，而且如果发现窃贼计划回来取芒果，他也必须赔偿窃贼。）如果他放弃对所有者（们）的责任，他就会犯《波罗夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In making these judgments, the Commentary is probably following the civil law of its day, for the Canon contains no reference at all to the concept of bhaṇḍadeyya, and some of its judgments contradict the Commentary’s. As we noted above, the Vibhaṅga states that if a bhikkhu breaks, scatters, burns, or otherwise renders unusable the property of another person, he incurs a dukkaṭa. When the Vinīta-vatthu discusses cases where a bhikkhu takes an item on mistaken assumptions, or where he feels compassion for an animal caught in a trap and so sets it free, it says that there is no offense. Thus it seems strange for the Commentary to assign a pārājika to an action that, according to the Canon, carries a dukkaṭa or no penalty at all. Of course, it would be a generous policy to offer the owner reasonable compensation, but it is by no means certain that a bhikkhu would have the wherewithal or liberty to do so. Because the Canon does not allow a bhikkhu to ask his supporters for donations to pay to another lay person—except for his parents (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Mv.VIII.22.1">Mv.VIII.22</a>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">BMC2, Chapter 10</a>)—there is no way a bhikkhu could raise the needed funds. The Canon places only one responsibility on a bhikkhu who causes material loss to a lay person: The Community, if it sees fit, can force him to apologize to the owner (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#Cv.I.20">Cv.I.20</a>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">BMC2, Chapter 20</a>). Beyond that, the Canon does not require that he make material compensation of any kind. Thus, as the Commentary’s concept of bhaṇḍadeyya is clearly foreign to the Canon, there seems no reason to adopt it.</td>
<td>在做出这些判断时，《义注》可能遵循了当时的民法，因为《圣典》根本没有提到 bhaṇḍadeyya 的概念，而且它的一些判断与《义注》的判断相矛盾。正如我们上面提到的，《经分别》指出，如果比丘破坏、散落、焚烧或以其他方式使他人的财产无法使用，他犯《突吉罗》。当《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》讨论比丘因错误的假设而拿走一件物品，或者他对被困在陷阱中的动物感到同情并因此将其释放的情况时，它说没有犯戒。因此，根据《圣典》，《义注》为一项犯《突吉罗》或根本没有犯戒的行为指定了《波罗夷》的惩罚，这似乎很奇怪。当然，为所有者提供合理的补偿是一项慷慨之举，但无法确定比丘是否有足够的资金或自由这样做。因为《圣典》不允许比丘向他的支持者索要捐款来支付给另一个在家人——除了他的父母（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0386a05">《大品》.八.22</a>；见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第十章</a>）——所以比丘不可能筹集到所需的资金。《圣典》只规定对在家人造成物质损失的比丘承担一项责任：如果僧团认为合适，可以强迫他向所有者道歉（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_011#0024a12">《小品》.一.20</a>；参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第二十章</a>）。除此之外，《圣典》并没有要求他做出任何形式的物质补偿。因此，由于《义注》中的 bhaṇḍadeyya 概念对于正典来说显然是不相干的，似乎没有理由采用它。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Enforcement of rules.</em> There is one important area in which even the Commentary does not require compensation, and that is when a bhikkhu sees another bhikkhu using an inappropriate object and arranges to have it destroyed. Here the Commentary draws its argument from the origin story to this rule, in which the Buddha orders the bhikkhus to destroy an inappropriately made hut—a “potter’s hut,” which was made from earth and then fired like a pot. From this example, the Commentary draws the following judgment: If a bhikkhu starts to build an inappropriate hut in a certain territory, the “owners” of the territory (i.e., the resident senior bhikkhus) should tell him to stop. If he does not heed their decision and actually builds the hut there, then when they are able to assemble a sufficient number of righteous bhikkhus, the resident senior bhikkhus can send him an order to remove it. If, after the order has been sent three times, the hut is still not removed, the bhikkhus are to dismantle it in such a way that the materials can be reused. The original builder is then to be told to remove the materials. If he doesn’t, then the resident bhikkhus are not responsible for any loss or damage they may undergo.</td>
<td><em>戒条的执行。</em>有一个重要的领域，在该领域甚至连《义注》也不要求赔偿，那就是当一位比丘看到另一位比丘使用不适当的物品并安排将其销毁时。在此，《义注》从这一戒条起源故事推引出论据，其中佛陀命令比丘摧毁一座不恰当建造的小屋（孤邸）——一座“陶工的小屋”，它是用泥土制成的，然后像锅一样烧制。从这个例子，《义注》得出如下判断：如果一个比丘开始在某个地区建造不合适的小屋，该地区的「主人」（即常住的长老）应该叫他停止。如果他不听从他们的决定，真的在那里建造了小屋，那么当他们能够聚集足够数量的正直比丘时，常住的长老就可以命令他拆除它。如果命令发出三次后，小屋仍未拆除，比丘们应将其拆除，以便材料可以重新使用。然后，原建筑者将被告知移除这些材料。如果他不这样做，那么居住的比丘们对可能遭受的任何损失或损害不负有责任。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary then derives a further principle from this example to say that if Bhikkhu X, who is knowledgeable in the Vinaya, sees Bhikkhu Y using inappropriate requisites of any sort, he is entitled to get them destroyed or reduced to an appropriate form. He is also not obligated to compensate Y for any loss or inconvenience incurred.</td>
<td>然后，《义注》从这个例子中得出进一步的原则，即如果精通戒律的 X 比丘看到 Y 比丘使用任何种类的不适当的必需品，他有权将它们销毁或简化为适当的形式。他也没有义务赔偿 Y 所遭受的任何损失或不便。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Court actions.</em> As stated above, if a bhikkhu knowingly starts an unfair court case against someone else and then wins it in the final court to which the accused makes appeal, he incurs a pārājika. The Commentary to the Bhikkhunīs’ <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bhikkhuni-pati.html#sg">Sg 1</a>, however, states that even if a bhikkhu is actually mistreated by someone—defamed, physically injured, robbed, etc.—and then tries to take a just court action against the guilty party, he incurs a pārājika if he wins. Again, this is an instance where the Commentary has no support from the Canon and, as the Vinaya-mukha points out, its assertion cannot stand. However, the training of a bhikkhu requires that he view all losses in the light of kamma and focus on looking after the state of his mind rather than on seeking compensation in social or material terms.</td>
<td><em>法庭诉讼。</em>如上所述，如果一个比丘故意向他人提起不公平的法庭诉讼，然后在被告提出上诉的最终法庭中胜诉，他犯《波罗夷》。然而，比丘尼<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_010#0304a05">《僧残》一</a>的《义注》指出，即使比丘实际上受到某人的虐待——诽谤、身体伤害、抢劫等——然后试图对有罪方采取公正的法庭行动，如果他赢了，他犯《波罗夷》。再一次，这是《义注》没有得到《圣典》支持的例子，并且正如《戒律入口》所指出的那样，它的主张是站不住脚的。然而，比丘的训练要求他从业的角度看待所有损失，并专注于照顾自己的心态，而不是寻求社会或物质方面的补偿。</td>

<tr><td><em>Infringement of copyright.</em> The international standards for copyright advocated by UNESCO state that infringement of copyright is tantamount to theft. However, in practice, an accusation of copyright infringement is judged not as a case of theft but as one of “fair use,” the issue being the extent to which a person in possession of an item may fairly copy that item for his/her own use or to give or sell to another person without compensating the copyright owner. Thus even a case of “unfair use” would not fulfill the factors of effort and object under this rule, in that—in creating a copy—one is not taking possession of an item that does not belong to one, and one is not depriving the owners of something already theirs. At most, the copyright owners might claim that they are being deprived of compensation owed to them, but as we have argued above, the principle of compensation owed does not rightly belong under this rule. In the terminology of the Canon, a case of unfair use would fall under either of two categories—acting for the material loss of the copyright owners or wrong livelihood—categories that entail a dukkaṭa under the general rule against misbehavior (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Cv.V.36">Cv.V.36</a>). They would also make one eligible for a disciplinary transaction, such as reconciliation or banishment (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">BMC2, Chapter 20</a>), which the Community could impose if it saw the infringement as serious enough to merit such a punishment.</td>
<td><em>侵犯版权。</em>联合国教科文组织所倡导的版权国际标准规定，侵害著作权等同于偷窃。然而，在实践中，侵犯版权的指控不是被视为偷窃案件，而是被视为「合理使用」案件，问题在于拥有某项物品的人可以在多大程度上合理地为自己使用复制该物品，或在不补偿版权所有者的情况下赠送或出售给他人。因此，即使是「不合理使用」的情况也不能满足此戒条下的努力和对象因素，因为在建立拷贝时，并没有占有不属于自己的物品，并且也没有剥夺所有者已经属于他们的东西。至多，版权所有者可能声称自己被剥夺了应得的赔偿，但正如我们上面所论证的，所欠赔偿原则不属于本戒条的范畴。在《圣典》的术语中，不合理使用的案件属于两种类别中的任何一种—为版权所有者的物质损失而采取行动或邪命—根据禁止不当行为的一般戒条，这两种类别意味著《突吉罗》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_015#0190a11">《小品》.五.36</a>）。它们还将使一个人符合接受治罪羯磨的条件，例如下意或驱出（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0060.html#BMC2chapter20">《佛教修道准则 第二册》第二十章</a>），如果僧团认为侵犯严重到足以值得受到这样的惩罚，则可以实施之。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Copying computer software.</em> The agreement made when installing software on a computer, by which one agrees not to give the software to anyone else, comes under contract law. As such, a breach of that contract would be treated under the category of “deceit,” described above, which means that a bhikkhu who gives software to a friend in defiance of this contract would incur the penalty for a broken promise. As for the friend—assuming that he is a bhikkhu—the act of receiving the software and putting it on his computer would be treated under the precedent, mentioned above, of the bhikkhus receiving fruit from an orchard groundkeeper not authorized to give it away: He would incur no offense. However, as he must agree to the contract before installing the software on his computer, he would incur a penalty for a broken promise if he then gave the software to someone else in defiance of the contract.</td>
<td><em>复制电脑软体。</em>在电脑上安装软体时达成的协议，即同意不将该软体提供给其他任何人的协议，受合约法管辖。因此，违反该合约将被视为上述「欺诈」类别，这意味著违反该合约而向朋友提供软体的比丘将因违背承诺而受到惩罚。至于朋友——假设他是比丘——接收软体并将其放入他的电脑的行为将按照上述比丘从未经授权赠送水果的果园管理员那里接收水果的先例来处理：他不会犯任何戒。然而，由于他在电脑上安装软体之前必须同意合约，如果他随后违反合约将软体提供给其他人，他将面临违背承诺的惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Credit cards.</em> The theft of a credit card would of course be an offense. Because the owner of the card, in most cases, would not be required to pay for the stolen card, the seriousness of a theft of this sort would be determined by how the thief used the card. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP20">NP 20</a> would forbid a bhikkhu from using a credit card to buy anything even if the card were his to use, although a bhikkhu who had gone to the extent of stealing a card would probably not be dissuaded by that rule from using it or having someone else use it for him. In any event, the use of the card would be equivalent to using a stolen key to open a safe. If the thief hands the credit card to a store clerk to make a purchase, that would count as a gesture telling the clerk to transfer funds from the account of the credit card company. Because such operations are automated, the clerk’s attempt to have the funds transferred would count not as an act of deceit but an act of taking. If the credit card company’s machines authorize the transaction, then the theft occurs as soon as funds are transferred from one account to another. The seriousness of the theft would be calculated in line with the principle of the “prior plan” mentioned above.</td>
<td><em>信用卡。</em>偷窃信用卡当然是犯戒。由于在大多数情况下，卡片的所有者不需要为被盗的卡片付款，因此此类偷窃的严重性将取决于偷窃者如何使用卡片。<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP20">《舍堕》二十</a>禁止比丘使用信用卡购买任何东西，即使该卡是他自己的而使用它，尽管该戒条可能无法阻止一个已经达到偷卡程度的比丘使用它或让某人替他使用它。无论如何，使用该卡就相当于使用偷来的钥匙打开保险箱。如果偷窃者将信用卡交给店员进行购买，这将被视为一种告诉店员从信用卡公司帐户中转移资金的示意动作。由于此类操作是自动化的，因此店员试图转移资金的行为不会被视为欺诈行为，而是一种拿取行为。如果信用卡公司的机器授权交易，那么一旦资金从一个帐户转移到另一个帐户，偷窃就算发生。偷窃的严重程度将按照上述「先前计划」的原则进行计算。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In a situation where the funds, if transferred, would entail a pārājika, then if the machines do not authorize the transaction, the bhikkhu trying to use the card would incur a thullaccaya for getting the clerk to attempt the transfer. If the clerk, doubting the bhikkhu’s right to use the card, refuses to attempt the transfer, the bhikkhu would incur a dukkaṭa in making the gesture of command.</td>
<td>在这种情况下，如果资金转移，犯《波罗夷》，那么如果机器不授权交易，尝试使用该卡的比丘将因让店员尝试转帐而犯《偷兰遮》。如果店员怀疑比丘使用该卡的权利而拒绝尝试转帐，比丘做出命令的示意动作就犯《突吉罗》。</td>

In the second, a bhikkhu with clairvoyant powers gains a vision of Sakka, the king of the devas, who is wearing an expensive cloth. The bhikkhu takes the cloth with the intention of making a robe for himself, even though Sakka keeps screaming, “Don’t take it! Don’t take it!” This latter example may have been included in the Commentary simply for its shock value in order to wake up sleepy students in the back of the room.

The Commentary states that if the bhikkhu finds out that the object does indeed have an owner, he owes the owner compensation and would be guilty of an offense when the owner abandons his efforts to gain that compensation. As we have already noted, the concept of compensation owed has no basis in the Canon, but if the object still lies in the bhikkhu’s possession and he decides not to return it, that decision would count as a thieving intention. The theft of the object could then be treated under the category of a borrowed object, which in practice has the same effect as the Commentary’s notion of compensation owed: The theft would be accomplished when the owner abandons his/her efforts to regain possession. However, if the object no longer exists (it was consumed by the bhikkhu or destroyed) or is no longer in the bhikkhu’s possession (he lost it or gave it away), the resolution of the issue is purely an individual matter between the bhikkhu and the owner, although as we noted above, the Community, if it sees fit, could force the bhikkhu to apologize to the owner.</td>

<tr><td>As for taking an item temporarily, the Commentary says this means taking it with the intention that (a) “I’ll return it” or (b) “I’ll make compensation.” There is support in the Vibhaṅga for including (a) here, but none for (b). If the Commentary included (b) to cover cases where a bhikkhu borrows an object but then happens to lose or destroy it, there is no need to include it, for as we have already explained, a bhikkhu is under no compulsion to compensate people for items lost or destroyed. If the Commentary meant it to cover cases where a bhikkhu takes ownership of an object belonging to a person with whom he has not established trust and with whom he plans to discuss compensation later, it doesn’t really fit under this exemption, for one is taking permanent possession of the item. Given the strict conditions that the Canon places on the exemption for taking an item on trust, it seems unlikely that its compilers would have countenanced an exemption for a bhikkhu to go around imposing unilateral trades, taking possession of items on the unfounded assumption that the owners would gladly accept compensation at a later time. If there is any place for this sort of exemption in the Vibhaṅga’s framework, it would be as a variant on taking on trust. Thus it would have to meet the following factors: The owner is an acquaintance or an intimate or has spoken of the matter; he/she is still alive; and one knows that he/she would be pleased if one takes the item and gives compensation later.</td>
<td>至于暂时拿走一件物品，《义注》称，这意味著拿走它的意图是（a）「我将归还它」或（b）「我将给予补偿」。《经分别》中支持此处纳入（a），但没有（b）。如果《义注》中纳入（b）以涵盖比丘借用物品但随后丢失或毁坏的情况，则无需纳入它，因为正如我们已经解释过的，比丘没有义务向人们赔偿物品丢失或毁坏。如果《义注》的意思是涵盖这样的情况：比丘拿走属于他尚未建立信任的人的物品的所有权，并且他计划稍后与该人讨论赔偿，那么它实际上不适合这种豁免，因为是永久占有该物品。鉴于《圣典》对以信任方式拿取物品的豁免规定了严格的条件，其编纂者似乎不太可能会支持比丘的豁免，以进行单方面交易，以毫无根据地假设所有者会乐意在以后接受补偿为由占有物品。如果在《经分别》的框架中存在这种豁免的地方，那将是作为基于信任拿取的一种变体。因此，它必须满足以下因素：所有者是熟人、密友或谈过此事；他/她还活著；知道如果拿走该物品并随后给予补偿，他/她会很高兴。</td>

From this, the Commentary infers that bhikkhus are not to act as doctors to lay people, an inference supported by the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg13">Sg 13</a>.

There are two ways of interpreting the discrepancy: Either the two sets differ only in language but not in substance, or they actually differ in substance. The Commentary, without seeming to notice what it is doing, adopts the second interpretation. In other words, it defines the factors of intention in markedly different ways in the different contexts, yet does not assert that one set of terms is more authoritative than the other or even take note of the differences between them. In fact, it takes one of the terms common to the non-offense clauses and the Vinīta-vatthu and defines it in one way in one context and another in the other. All of this creates a great deal of confusion.</td>

<tr><td>The non-offense clauses state that there is no offense for a bhikkhu who acts unintentionally, not knowing, or without aiming at death. In the Vinīta-vatthu, <em>unintentionally</em> is used to describe cases in which a bhikkhu acts accidentally, such as dropping a poorly held stone, brick, or adze; removing a pestle from a shelf and accidentally knocking off another one. <em>Not knowing</em> is used in cases in which the bhikkhu deliberately does an action but without knowing that his action could cause death. An example would be giving food to a friend not knowing that it is poisoned. <em>Not aiming at death</em> is used in cases where the bhikkhu deliberately does an action but does not intend that action to result in death. Relevant examples include trying to help a bhikkhu who is choking on food by slapping him on the back and inadvertently causing his death; telling a bhikkhu to stand on a piece of scaffolding while helping with construction work, only to see the scaffolding collapse; describing the joys of heaven to an audience, only to have a member of the audience decide to commit suicide in hopes of going there.</td>
<td>不犯条款说，比丘无意、不知、或不以死亡为目的的行为并不构成犯戒。在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中，「<em>无意</em>」用来描述比丘意外地做出的行为的情况，例如，把拿不稳的石头、砖头或锛子掉在地上；从架子上取下一把研杵，不小心碰掉了另一把。「<em>不知</em>」用于比丘故意做某事但不知道他的行为可能导致死亡的情况。一个例子是给朋友食物，但他不知道食物有毒。「<em>不以死亡为目的</em>」用于比丘故意做某事但无意导致死亡的情况。相关的例子包括，试图拍打一位被食物噎住的比丘的背来帮助他，却无意中导致了他的死亡；告诉一位比丘在帮忙建筑时站在鹰架上，结果却看到鹰架倒塌；向听众描述天界的欢乐，结果却有一位听众决定自杀，希望能去那里。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, to fulfill the factor of intention here, a bhikkhu must be acting intentionally, knowingly, and aiming at death.</td>
<td>因此，为了满足这里的意图因素，比丘必须有意地、明知地、以死亡为目的而行动。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The word-analysis covers all the same points—although it shuffles the terms around—when it defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” Without teasing out the differences in terminology, we may simply note the important point added in its analysis, which is that an act of manslaughter counts as intentional here only when the bhikkhu has made a clear decision to kill. Thus if he were to strike a person unthinkingly in a sudden fit of rage, without being clear about what his intention was, it would not qualify as “intentional” here. The Commentary seconds this point when it defines <em>having made the decision</em> as “having summoned up a reckless mind state, ‘crushing’ through the power of an attack.” The Sub-commentary does not explain <em>crushing</em> or <em>attack</em> here, but apparently they mean aggressively overcoming, through a brute act of will, any contrary or hesitant thoughts in the mind.</td>
<td>当语句解说将<em>故意</em>定义为「有意愿，明知且有意识地做出决定」时，语句解说涵盖了所有相同的要点，尽管它对术语进行了重新排列。在不梳理出术语差异的情况下，我们可以简单地注意到其分析中添加的重点，即只有当比丘明确决定杀人时，过失杀人行为才算故意杀人。因此，如果他在没有明确意图的情况下，突然发怒，不假思索地打人，这里就不算是「故意」。《义注》支持这一点，将<em>做出决定</em>定义为「唤起鲁莽的精神状态，透过攻击的力量『粉碎』」。这里的《复注》并没有解释<em>粉碎</em>或<em>攻击</em>，但显然它们的意思是透过意志的残酷行为，积极地克服心中任何相反或犹豫的想法。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains a few cases where bhikkhus kill people in situations where they did not even know that there was a person there: throwing a stone over a precipice, not knowing that there was a person standing below; sitting down on a pile of cloth on a chair, not knowing that a child was underneath the cloth; and setting fire to a grove, not knowing that there were people in the grove. The Buddha dismisses the first two cases without explanation as not coming under this rule. The last he classifies as an example of <em>not aiming at death</em>. We can conclude from this example that <em>aiming at death</em> must include the perception that there was someone there who could die. The Commentary seconds this conclusion in its analysis of the phrase <em>knowingly and consciously</em> in the word-analysis’s definition of intentionally. Although it again shuffles the terms around—using <em>consciously</em> to describe what the Vinīta-vatthu describes as <em>knowingly</em>—the important point in its conclusion is that an essential element in the factor of intention is the factor of perception: In its words, one must be aware that, “This is a living being.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>Note that, given this definition, one need not know that the living being is a human being for the factor of perception to be fulfilled. The Commentary illustrates this point with an example in which a bhikkhu who, seeing a goat lying down in a certain spot during the day, decides to return to that spot to kill the goat that night. In the meantime, however, the goat gets up and a man comes to lie down in its place. The bhikkhu approaches the man in the dark, still thinking him to be a goat, and kills him. The verdict: a pārājika.</td>
<td>请注意，根据此定义，无需知道活著的众生是人类即可满足感知因素。《义注》中用一个例子来说明这一点：一位比丘白天看到一只山羊躺在某个地方，决定当天晚上回到那个地方杀死这只山羊。然而同时，山羊站了起来，一个人在它的位置上躺了下来。比丘在黑暗中接近这个人，仍然认为他是一只山羊，并杀死了他。结论：《波罗夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although this judgment may seem strange, there is nothing in the Canon to contradict it. The closest case in the Vinīta-vatthu concerns a bhikkhu who digs a pitfall with the intention that whatever living beings fall into it will perish. The penalty, if an animal dies as a result, is a pācittiya; if a human being, a pārājika. In this case, the intention/perception of killing a living being is broad enough to include a human being, and so fulfills the relevant factors here.</td>
<td>虽然这个判断看起来很奇怪，但《圣典》中没有任何内容与之相矛盾。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中最接近的例子涉及一位比丘，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0103a10">他挖了一个陷阱</a>，意图让任何掉入其中的生物都会死亡。若动物因此死亡，则惩罚为《波逸提》；如果是人类，则为《波罗夷》。在这种情况下，杀死生物的意图/感知足够广泛，广泛到足以包括人类，因此满足这里的相关因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing this last case, the Commentary notes that if one digs the pitfall but then renounces one’s intention to cause death, one has to completely fill in the pitfall in such a way that it cannot cause injury—even to the extent of causing someone to stumble—if one wants to avoid the penalty coming from any injury the pitfall might cause. If the pitfall is only partially filled in and a person stumbles into it and later dies from his injuries, the bhikkhu incurs the full offense under this rule. The same judgment applies to any other attempt to kill not aimed at a particular victim. For instance, if a bhikkhu harboring this sort of general intention builds a trap but then changes his mind, he has to destroy the trap so thoroughly that it cannot be reassembled. Similarly, when a bhikkhu writes a passage describing the advantages of dying (see below) with the thought that anyone who reads it might decide to commit suicide, if he then changes his mind he has to destroy the writing so thoroughly that it cannot be pieced together. If, instead of writing the passage himself, he simply picks up a pre-existing written passage of this sort and then—with a similar intention—puts it in a place where it might be easily seen, he can avoid any penalty simply by returning the passage to the place where he found it.</td>
<td>在讨论最后一个案例时，《义注》指出，如果一个人挖了陷阱，但随后又放弃了致人死亡的意图，如果想避免因陷阱可能造成的伤害而受到惩罚，必须以一种不会造成伤害的方式完全填满陷阱－甚至不会造成某人绊倒。如果陷阱只被部分填满，而某人跌入其中并随后因受伤而死亡，则根据此戒条，比丘将完全违犯。同样的判决也适用于任何其他不针对特定受害者的杀害企图。例如，如果一位比丘怀有这种普遍意图，建造了一个陷阱，但后来又改变了主意，他必须彻底摧毁这个陷阱，使其无法重新组装起来。同样地，当一位比丘写了一篇描述死亡好处的文章（见下文），并认为任何读过它的人都可能决定自杀时，如果他随后改变主意，他就必须彻底毁掉这篇文章，以至于无法将其拼凑起来。如果他不是自己写这篇文章，而是仅仅拿起已有的此类书面文章，然后以类似的意图将其放在容易看到的地方，他只需将文章放回到他发现它的地方就可以避免任何惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the topic of pitfalls, the Commentary also treats the issue of how much of an intention counts when setting up a situation that might cause death. Specifically, it asks whether—while one is digging a hole for another purpose—a passing thought that “this hole could kill anyone who fell into it” would fulfill the factor of intention under this rule, or whether this factor would be fulfilled only if the original purpose for digging the hole was to cause death. The Commentary notes that opinions are divided on this point, but it sides with the latter position.</td>
<td>在讨论陷阱这个主题时，《义注》还讨论了在造成可能导致死亡的情况时意图的重要性的问题。具体来说，它询问－当一个人为了另一个目的而挖洞时－一闪而过的想法「这个洞可能会杀死掉进去的任何人」会满足本戒条下的意图因素，或者这个因素只有在挖这个洞的最初目的是为了致人死亡的情况下才会被满足。《义注》说，在这一点上意见分歧，但它支持后一种立场。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu contains an unusual case of a bhikkhu who uses a friend as a guinea pig for testing poison. The friend dies, and the bhikkhu incurs only a thullaccaya. The Commentary explains this by distinguishing two types of test: one to see if a particular poison is strong enough to kill a person; the other, to see if a particular person is strong enough to survive the poison. In either of these cases, the bhikkhu incurs a thullaccaya regardless of whether the victim dies. If, though, the bhikkhu gives poison to a person with the desire that it cause that person’s death, he incurs a pārājika if the victim dies, and a thullaccaya if not.</td>

<tr><td><strong>TELLING B TO KILL C.</strong> The way in which a bhikkhu is penalized for getting another person to commit a murder—through sign or verbal command—can be inferred from the discussion of accomplices under the preceding rule. The Vibhaṅga here, as under that rule, states that if one’s accomplice does not follow one’s instructions precisely, one is absolved of an offense. In discussing this point, the Commentary goes into great detail concerning the six ways the command to kill can be specified: the object [the person to be killed], the time, the place, the weapon to use, the action by which the weapon is to be used [e.g., “Stab him in the neck”], and the position the victim should be in [sitting, standing, lying down] when the act is to be done. If the instigator specifies any of these things and yet his accomplice does not carry them out to the letter, the instigator does not incur the penalty for the actual murder. For instance, Bhikkhu A tells his student B to kill C while C is sitting in meditation at midnight. The student gets into C’s room at midnight, only to find C asleep in bed, which is where he kills him. Bhikkhu A thus incurs only the thullaccaya for convincing his student to accept the command.</td>
<td><strong>叫 B 去杀 C。</strong>比丘因唆使他人去谋杀而受到惩罚的方式－透过示意动作或口头命令－可以从前一个戒条下共犯的讨论中推断出来。根据该戒条，《经分别》在此说，如果共犯没有完全遵循指示，那么就可以免于犯戒。《义注》在论述这一点时，详细阐述了杀人命令的六种措辞方式：对象[要被杀的人]、时间、地点、使用的武器、使用武器的动作[例如，「刺他的脖子」]，以及受害者在进行该行动时应采取的姿势[坐著、站立、躺著]。如果教唆者指定了其中任何一项，但他的共犯没有严格执行，则教唆者不会因实际谋杀而受到惩罚。例如，比丘 A 告诉他的学生 B ，在半夜 C 打坐的时候，杀了 C 。学生半夜进入 C 的房间，发现 C 睡在床上，于是他在那里杀死了他。因此，比丘 A 只因说服他的学生接受命令而犯《偷兰遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As under the preceding rule, the Commentary tries to argue that if B will certainly succeed in killing C in line with A’s command, A incurs a pārājika when giving the command, but again, this opinion does not conform with the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>正如前一个戒条一样，《义注》试图争辩说，如果 B 按照 A 的命令肯定会成功杀死 C ，则 A 在发出命令时犯《波罗夷》，但同样地，这种观点不符合《经分别》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The case of the innocent accomplice—one who does not know that the action he is being told to do will result in death—also seems relevant here, as in the case where a bhikkhu prepares a syringe of poison and tells his accomplice, who thinks the syringe contains medicine, to inject it into a patient. There seems every reason to impose a pārājika on the bhikkhu if the patient then dies, but the accomplice would incur no offense.</td>
<td>无辜共犯的案例－一个不知道他被告知要做的行为会导致死亡的人－似乎也与这里有关，就像一位比丘准备一筒注射器毒药并告诉他的共犯的情况一样，他的共犯认为注射器含有药物，用于将其注射到病人体内。如果病人死了，似乎有充分的理由对比丘施加《波罗夷》，但共犯没有犯戒。</td>

The executioner follows his advice and the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika, for the recommendation to kill mercifully is still a recommendation to kill. According to the Vinīta-vatthu, if the executioner says that he will not follow the bhikkhu’s advice and then kills his victims as he pleases, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. The Commentary adds that if the executioner tries to follow the bhikkhu’s advice and yet needs more than one blow to do the job, the bhikkhu incurs a thullaccaya.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td><strong>INDIRECT STATEMENTS.</strong> The Canon and Commentary differ as to whether indirect statements that are not imperatives would also qualify as commands or recommendations under this rule. The Commentary maintains that a bhikkhu cannot get around a penalty by phrasing his wish for a murder in more roundabout ways, and gives an example in which a bhikkhu tells people, “In such-and-such a place a bandit is staying. Whoever cuts off his head will receive great honor from the King.” If any of the bhikkhu’s listeners kills the bandit as a result of his instigation, the Commentary says, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika.</td>
<td><strong>间接陈述。</strong>对于非命令性的间接陈述是否也符合本戒条下的命令或建议的问题，《圣典》和《义注》存在分歧。《义注》认为，比丘不能以更迂回的方式表达他想要谋杀的愿望来逃避惩罚，并举了一个比丘告诉人们的例子：「在某某地方，有一个强盗居住。谁砍下他的头，谁就会受到国王的极大荣耀。」《义注》说，如果比丘的任何听众在他的怂恿下杀死了强盗，比丘犯《波罗夷》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Examples of commands and recommendations in the Canon, however, are all expressed as imperatives: “Do this!” “If you want him to die, do this.” The only examples of indirect statements are those in which a bhikkhu expresses a wish, “O, if only so-and-so were murdered.” According to the Vibhaṅga, this statement incurs a dukkaṭa regardless of whether it is made in public or private, and regardless of whether one knows that anyone else is overhearing it or not. There is no discussion, however, of what one’s intention might be in making the statement, nor of the consequences for the speaker if anyone, inspired by his remark, actually kills the person in question. This implies that the authors of the Vibhaṅga did not regard statements of this sort as fulfilling the factor of effort under this rule. This may seem unduly lenient, but given that a bhikkhu whose express command to kill is followed but not to the letter would also incur only a thullaccaya, this judgment seems consistent with the Vibhaṅga’s pattern of assigning penalties.</td>
<td>然而，《圣典》中的命令和建议的例子都以祈使语气表达：「这样做！」「如果你想让他死，就这么做吧。」间接陈述的唯一例子是那些比丘表达愿望的例子：「噢，如果某某被谋杀就好了。」根据《经分别》，这种陈述会犯《突吉罗》，无论它是公开说还是私下说，也无论一个人是否知道其他人正在无意中听到它。然而，没有讨论发表陈述的意图是什么，也没有讨论如果有人受到他的言论的启发，实际上杀死了有关的人，那么他将面临什么后果。这暗示《经分别》的作者并不认为此类陈述满足了本戒条下的努力因素。这可能显得过于宽松，但考虑到比丘如果遵守明示的杀戮命令，但不严格执行，也只会犯《偷兰遮》，这一判决似乎与《经分别》的惩罚模式一致。</td>

<tr><td>In addition to the four above categories of means of killing, the Commentary includes two of its own:</td>

<tr><td>The Canon contains a number of passages—MN 56 is one example—describing people who, “developed in mind,” use their powers to kill. The Commentary notes the existence of these passages and of “some teachers” who cite them as proof that meditative powers can be used in this way, but it dismisses the idea on the grounds that meditative powers are skillful and based on pleasant mental states, whereas the act of killing is unskillful and based on painful mental states. The Sub-commentary adds that the powers described in the Canon are actually based on magical formulae. Still, because the success of these formulae depends on a certain level of concentration, it would seem that using one’s powers of concentration to kill would fulfill the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>《圣典》包含许多段落（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/056.html">《中部》56经</a>就是一个例子），描述那些「心智发达」的人，利用自己的力量杀人。《义注》指出了这些段落的存在以及「一些老师」的存在，这些老师引用它们作为冥想力量可以以这种方式使用的证据，但它驳回了这个想法，因为冥想力量是善巧的并且基于愉快的精神状态，而杀戮行为是不善巧的并且基于痛苦的精神状态。《复注》补充说，《圣典》中描述的力量实际上是基于魔咒的。不过，因为这些咒语的成功取决于某种程度的定，所以用定力杀人似乎就满足了这里的努力因素。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>As the rule indicates, a bhikkhu may commit an offense under this rule not only by using any of the six above-mentioned means of taking life but also by “searching for an assassin.” The Vibhaṅga explains this phrase in the rule simply with a list of weapons: a sword, a spear, a harpoon (§—BD omits this item), a skewer/stake, a club, a stone, a knife, poison, or a rope. There are two ways of making sense of this list. One is that, because the Pali word for assassin is literally “knife-carrier” (<em>satthahāraka</em>), the Vibhaṅga is taking pains to explain that an assassin might also use other weapons aside from a knife. The other way of interpreting the list, favored by the Commentary, is to view the Vibhaṅga’s list as an attempt to define the word <em>satthahāraka</em>—which, according to the Commentary, is a general term for a murderous weapon. The Commentary then goes on to say that the entire phrase <em>searching for an assassin</em> means setting up a stationary device, as described above. There are two problems with this interpretation, the first being that the word <em>satthahāraka</em> clearly means “assassin” in other parts of the Canon (see, for example, MN 145); the second being that this interpretation makes the phrase entirely superfluous: setting up a stationary device is already covered by another part of the rule. Thus we will follow the first interpretation of the Vibhaṅga’s explanation of the phrase: It is indicating that an assassin may use any weapon at all.</td>
<td>正如戒条所表明的，比丘不仅可以使用上述六种夺取生命方式中的任何一种，而且还可以透过「寻找行凶者」来犯戒。《经分别》仅仅用一张武器清单解释了戒条中的这句话：剑、矛、鱼叉（§—《戒律书》省略了此项）、串子/木桩、棍棒、石头、刀、毒药或绳索。有两种方法可以理解这个清单。一是，因为巴利单字中行凶者的字面意思是「持刀者」（<em>satthahāraka</em>），所以《经分别》煞费苦心地解释行凶者除了刀之外还可能使用其他武器。理解该清单的另一种方式，受到《义注》的青睐，是将《经分别》的清单视为试图定义 <em>satthahāraka</em> 此单字－根据《义注》，此单字是杀人武器的通用术语。《义注》接著说，<em>寻找行凶者</em>整句话意思是设置固定装置，如上所述。这个理解有两个问题，第一个是 <em>satthahāraka</em> 此单字在《圣典》的其他部分中明确表示「行凶者」（参见，例如，<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/145.html">《中部》145经</a>）；第二个是，这种理解使该句话完全多余：戒条的另一部分已经涵盖了设置固定装置。因此，我们将遵循《经分别》对这句话的解释的第一个理解：它表明行凶者可以使用任何武器。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question remains, however, as to how this interpretation is not redundant with <em>commanding</em> under the explanation of the ways of taking life. The answer appears to be this: The word <em>satthahāraka</em> is most commonly used in the Canon in the context of an assisted suicide, in which a person who wants to die but cannot bring himself to commit suicide arranges for someone else, a satthahāraka, to kill him. Thus the inclusion of this phrase in the rule means that a bhikkhu intent on dying who arranges for someone else to do the job for him would incur all the derived offenses leading up to the actual death. At present, this would rule out trying to get a doctor to arrange an assisted suicide for oneself. If one were to help arrange an assisted suicide for someone else, the case would come under <em>commanding</em>, above, as would the case of arranging an assassin for someone else not at that person’s request.</td>
<td>然而，问题仍然在于，在解释夺取生命的方式时，这种理解如何与<em>命令</em>并存而不显得多余。答案似乎是这样的：「<em>satthahāraka</em>」这个单字在《圣典》中最常用于协助自杀，即一个想要死但又无法自杀的人安排其他人（satthahāraka）杀死他。因此，在戒条中包含这句话意味著，一个想要死亡的比丘如果安排其他人为他做这项工作，将会犯下导致实际死亡的所有衍生违犯。目前，这将排除试图让医生为自己安排协助自杀的可能性。如果要帮助他人安排协助自杀，那么该情况属于上述的<em>命令</em>，就像在未经他人请求下，为该人安排行凶者的情况一样。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see below, cases where one tries to kill oneself without arranging for someone else to do the job would not come under this rule. The apparent reason for making a distinction and including the act of “searching for an assassin” to kill oneself under this rule is that, in doing so, one would be asking another person to take on the seriously unskillful kamma of taking a human life.</td>
<td>正如我们将在下面看到的，一个人试图自杀而不安排其他人来完成这项工作的情况不属于这一戒条。做出区分并将「寻找行凶者」自杀行为纳入这项戒条的明显原因是，这样做时，会要求另一个人承担夺人生命的严重不善业。</td>

<tr><td>This, the third type of act covered by this rule, can include berating a sick person (“Why do you keep hanging on to life like this? Don’t you realize what a burden you are to others?”) or simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death. The Vinīta-vatthu also includes under this type of act any statements that a nurse might make out of compassion to shorten the miseries of an illness by encouraging a patient to let go of life so as not to dawdle in the face of death. Thus, the Commentary notes, a bhikkhu talking to a dying patient should be very circumspect in how he chooses his words, focusing not on how to speed up the dying process but on how to inspire the patient with the following thoughts: “The attainment of the paths and fruitions is not out of the ordinary for a virtuous person. So, having formed no attachment for such things as your dwelling, and establishing mindfulness in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, or the body, you should be heedful in your attention.” The Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr4">Pr 4</a> contains a number of stories in which bhikkhus comfort a dying bhikkhu by asking him to reflect on what he has attained through the practice, which was apparently a common way of encouraging a dying bhikkhu to focus his thoughts on the best object possible. The suttas also contain advice on how to encourage patients facing death. See, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN143.html">MN 143</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN36_7.html">SN 36:7</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN55_54.html">SN 55:54</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN6_16.html">AN 6:16</a>.

</tr>
<tr><td><em>Inaction.</em> Given the Vibhaṅga’s definition of taking life, we can infer that inaction does not fulfill the factor of effort here, for it does not cut off the life faculty. Thus if a bhikkhu sits idly when seeing a flood sweep a person downstream, he commits no offense—regardless of his feelings about the person’s death—even if the person then drowns. Recommending that another person sit idly as well would also not fulfill the factor of effort here, because the category of <em>command</em> covers only the act of inciting the listener to do any of the four actions that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule.</td>
<td><em>不作为（见死不救）。</em>根据《经分别》对夺取生命的定义，我们可以推断，不作为在这里并不能满足努力因素，因为它不会切断命根。因此，如果比丘看到洪水把人冲到下游时，无所事事地坐著，那么无论他对这个人的死亡有什么感受，即使这个人随后被淹死，他也不会犯任何戒。建议另一个人也无所事事地坐著也不会满足这里的努力因素，因为<em>命令</em>类别仅涵盖煽动听者执行本戒条下满足努力因素的四种行动中的任何一种。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Medical care and life-support.</em> The same holds true if a bhikkhu decides not to give a patient a treatment—or to discontinue treatment—that might conceivably extend the patient’s life: It does not fulfill the factor of effort, for such acts do not cut off the life faculty. At most they simply allow it to end on its own. The Canon supports this inference by treating such actions not under this rule but under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VIII.26.1-8">Mv.VIII.26.3-4</a>, where it imposes only a dukkaṭa on the act of refusing to give any treatment at all to an ill bhikkhu, or of discontinuing all care for an ill bhikkhu prior to his recovery or death. This shows that the compilers of the Canon did not regard these acts as cutting off the life faculty. (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VIII.26.1-8">Mv.VIII.26.8</a> lists the ideal characteristics of a bhikkhu who tends to the sick, but does not impose a penalty on a bhikkhu who cares for the sick but lacks the ideal qualities; at no point does the Canon impose a required level of care for the sick. The compilers’ refusal to mandate a level of care is wise. If there were a case in which the bhikkhus did not feel that that level of care was appropriate for their patient, they would have only one option: to abandon the patient, so as to incur only a dukkaṭa and not the potentially higher penalty for not measuring up to the mandated care. Thus, instead of protecting the patient, a higher level of mandated care would expose the patient to abandonment.) For this reason, deciding to withhold or discontinue a particular treatment—while still continuing otherwise to care for the patient—would not be grounds for an offense.</td>
<td><em>医疗护理和生命维持。</em>如果比丘决定不提供患者可以延长患者生命的治疗，或停止治疗，同样的情况也适用：它不满足努力因素，因为这样的行为不会切断命根。最多只是允许生命自行结束。《圣典》支持这一推论，不是根据本戒条而是根据<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0391a09">《大品》.八.26.3-4</a>来处理此类行为，其中拒绝对生病的比丘进行任何治疗，或在生病的比丘康复或死亡之前停止对他的所有护理的行为，仅只犯《突吉罗》。由此可见，《圣典》的编纂者并不认为这些行为是切断命根的行为。（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0393a02">《大品》.八.26.8</a>列出了照顾病人的比丘的理想特质，但没有对照顾病人但缺乏理想特质的比丘施加惩罚；《圣典》在任何时候都没有规定病人所需的护理水平。编译者拒绝强制规定护理水平是明智的。如果出现比丘们认为该水平的护理不适合他们的病人的情况，他们只有一个选择：放弃患者，这样只会犯《突吉罗》，而不是因为未达到强制规定的护理水平而受到潜在的更高惩罚。因此，更高水平的强制护理不但不能保护患者，反而会使患者面临被遗弃的风险。）因此，决定拒绝或停止特定治疗－同时仍继续以其他方式护理患者－不会成为犯戒的理由。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, a bhikkhu caring for a patient acts in a way to cut off the patient’s life faculty, that would fulfill the factor of effort here. The Vinīta-vatthu makes this point with a set of cases in which bhikkhus give patients treatments that are actually harmful for the patients. In the instances where the other factors for an offense are present—the bhikkhus mean to kill the patient, and the patient dies—the bhikkhus incur the full offense. In another set of cases, a bhikkhu feeling pity for a friend in severe pain praises the pleasures that await him after death. Again, in the instances where the bhikkhu intends to bring about the patient’s death and the patient dies, the bhikkhu incurs a pārājika.</td>

<tr><td><em>Shared responsibility.</em> Unlike the Vibhaṅga to the preceding rule, the Vibhaṅga here does not explicitly discuss the issue of how to allot penalties when a group of bhikkhus acts together to commit a murder but only one of them delivers the fatal blow. However, the Vinīta-vatthu contains a series of cases in which bhikkhus act as a group to give a treatment to a sick bhikkhu with the aim of ending his life. When the bhikkhu dies, all of them incur a pārājika. In one of the cases the bhikkhu dies from a medical treatment to the nose, in another he dies from eating food. None of the texts discuss whether all the bhikkhus in question took turns giving the fatal dosage, or if only one of the bhikkhus did while the others helped to prepare it. Given that arranging an assassin would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule, it seems reasonable to infer that actively assisting in a murder would also fulfill the factor, even if one does not deliver the fatal blow. From this inference we can conclude that the discussion of shared responsibility under the preceding rule would also apply here.</td>
<td><em>共同责任。</em>与前一个戒条的《经分别》不同的是，这里的《经分别》并没有明确讨论当一群比丘共同实施谋杀但只有一个人造成致命一击时如何分配惩罚的问题。然而，《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》包含一系列比丘们以团体的方式治疗生病的比丘，并打算结束他的生命的案例。当比丘去世时，他们都犯《波罗夷》。在其中一例中，比丘因鼻子接受治疗而死亡，在另一例中，他则因进食而死亡。没有任何文本讨论是否所有相关的比丘轮流给予致命的剂量，或者是只有一名比丘这样做，而其他比丘则帮助准备。鉴于安排一名行凶者就满足了本戒条下的努力因素，似乎可以合理地推断，即使没有造成致命一击，积极协助谋杀也满足了这一因素。由此推论，我们可以得出结论，前一个戒条中关于共同责任的讨论也适用于此处。</td>

<tr><td>This factor is fulfilled if, as a result of the bhikkhu’s action, the victim dies through the cutting of his/her life-faculty. Because the life-faculty is something that inevitably ends, there is a need to define clearly how far the influences of a bhikkhu’s actions should be traced for him to be considered responsible for a death.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary treats this issue by posing two scenarios under its discussion of pitfalls. In the first, an intended victim survives a fall into a pitfall, manages to climb out, but later dies of a disease incurred from the fall. In this case, the Commentary says, the factor of result is fulfilled. The same holds true if the disease goes into remission only to return and take the victim’s life many years later. If complications arise from the disease, however, and the victim dies from a combination of the disease and its complications, then if the original disease was the predominant factor in the death, the bhikkhu would be responsible for the victim’s death; if the complications were the predominant factor, he would not.</td>
<td>《义注》透过在陷阱讨论中提出两种情境来处理这个问题。第一种情况是，一名预定的受害者跌入陷阱后幸存下来，并设法爬出来，但后来死于跌倒引起的疾病。《义注》说，在这种情况下，结果因素就被满足。如果疾病得到缓解，但多年后又复发并夺走受害者的生命，情况也是如此。然而，如果并发症是由疾病引起的，而受害者因疾病及其并发症的结合而死亡，那么如果原本的疾病是死亡的主要因素，比丘就要对受害者的死亡负责；如果并发症是主要因素，他就不必负责。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the second scenario, an intended victim falls into the pitfall while being chased by thieves but does not die in the fall. Instead, the thieves catch up with him, drag him out of the pitfall, and kill him. In this case, the bhikkhu is still responsible for the victim’s death because his pitfall was instrumental in enabling the thieves to catch and kill the victim.</td>
<td>在第二种情况下，预定的受害者在被小偷追赶时掉入陷阱，但并未死亡。相反，小偷追上了他，将他从陷阱中拖了出来，并杀死了他。在这种情况下，比丘仍然对受害者的死亡负有责任，因为他的陷阱有助于小偷抓住并杀死受害者。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also considers a different sort of case related to the factor of result: If a bhikkhu means to cause the death of a group of people, then when any member of the group dies as a result of his efforts, the Commentary says that he incurs a pārājika. In other words, he does not have to fulfill his intention of killing the whole group in order to fulfill the factor of result here.</td>
<td>《义注》也考虑了与结果因素相关的另一种情况：如果一个比丘有意造成一群人的死亡，那么当该群体的任何成员由于他的努力而死亡时，《义注》说，他犯《波罗夷》。也就是说，他并不需要实现杀死整个群体的意图，才能满足这里的结果因素。</td>

In one case it says that a bhikkhu who means to kill X but kills Y instead incurs a pārājika. In another case it tells of a bhikkhu who gives medicine to a woman who wants to commit an abortion near the end of a full-term pregnancy. The woman takes the medicine but, instead of the fetus’ aborting, the woman dies and the infant survives. In this case, the bhikkhu incurs a thullaccaya, presumably for the pain he caused the infant.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary tries to resolve this contradiction with an illustration: A bhikkhu with a grudge against A decides to ambush him. He sees B coming down the road and, mistaking him for A, shoots him dead on the spot. Because his intention was to kill the person he was aiming at, he incurs a pārājika. We can call this a case of mistaken identity. In cases of this sort, whether the “right” or the “wrong” person dies is of no consequence to the offense.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, the bhikkhu is a poor shot, takes aim at B but misses him, and inadvertently kills C instead, he does not incur a pārājika, for he did not intend to kill C during any part of his action. His only penalties are the dukkaṭas he incurs while preparing for B’s murder.</td>
<td>然而，如果比丘射击技术不佳，瞄准 B 但没有击中他，并且无意中杀死了 C ，那么他就不会犯《波罗夷》，因为他在行动的任何部分都无意杀死 C 。他唯一受到的惩罚是在准备谋杀 B 时犯《突吉罗》。</td>

<tr><td>1) A bhikkhu, sitting down hard in a chair without first checking it carefully, kills a child lying in the chair and covered with a blanket—no penalty for the death, but a dukkaṭa for sitting down without first checking carefully.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>2) Some group-of-six bhikkhus, for the fun of it, throw a rock from a mountaintop and accidentally kill a young cowherd standing below—again, no penalty for the death, but a dukkaṭa for throwing a rock in fun. (The Commentary states that <em>rock</em> here also covers sticks, bricks, and other similar objects; and that <em>throwing</em> also includes rolling. It also states that if a bhikkhu has a valid reason for throwing or rolling a rock not in fun—for example, he is engaged in construction work and rolls a piece of rock to someone else on the job; he is eating his meal and throws a piece of wood to chase away crows or dogs—he incurs no offense.)</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>3) A bhikkhu, feeling oppressed and discontented, throws himself over a cliff. Instead of dying, he lands on and kills a hapless basket-maker standing at the foot of the cliff—again, no offense for the death, but a dukkaṭa for throwing oneself from a high place. This rule shows that attempts to kill oneself—aside from searching for an assassin, as mentioned above—would not come under the main rule here, because the bhikkhu would have apparently felt pain when landing on the basket-maker, and yet the penalty is only a dukkaṭa. If the case had been treated under the main rule, he would have been penalized with a thullaccaya instead.</td>
<td>3）一位比丘<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_001#0111a09">感到压抑和不满，跳崖自杀</a>。他没有死，而是压死了站在悬崖脚下的一个倒霉的编篮人－同样，并没有因该死亡事故受到惩罚，但因为从高处跳下自杀而犯《突吉罗》。这条戒条表明，除了如上所述寻找行凶者之外，企图自杀不属于这里的主要戒条，因为比丘压在编篮人身上时显然会感到疼痛，但惩罚只是《突吉罗》。如果按照主要戒条处理此案，他会犯《偷兰遮》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary extrapolates from this case to apply the dukkaṭa to all attempts at suicide, including even the decision not to take food when motivated by a desire to die. However, it then runs into the question of how far this penalty applies to a bhikkhu who is ill. Its verdict: As long as medicine and attendants are available to him, the penalty would still apply. But then it lists two cases where the penalty would <em>not</em> apply: (a) A bhikkhu is suffering from a long and serious illness, and the attendant bhikkhus are fed up with caring for him, thinking, “<em>When</em> will we be free of this sick one?” If the bhikkhu reflects that, even with medical care, his body won’t last and that the bhikkhus are being put to difficulties, he incurs no penalty in refusing food and medicine. (b) A bhikkhu—reflecting that his illness is harsh, the forces of life are running out, and yet the noble attainments appear to be within his reach—may refuse food and medicine without penalty.</td>
<td>《义注》从这个案例中推断，将《突吉罗》应用于所有自杀企图，甚至包括出于求死的动机而决定不吃东西。然而，接下来的问题是，这种惩罚对于生病的比丘适用到什么程度。其判决是：只要他有药物和护理人员，惩罚仍然适用。但随后它列出了两种<em>不</em>适用惩罚的情况： (a) 一位比丘患有长期而严重的疾病，护理的比丘厌倦了照顾他，心想：「我们<em>什么时候</em>才能摆脱这个病人？」如果比丘反思，即使有医疗护理，他的身体也无法长久，而比丘们正面临困难，那么他不会因拒绝食物和药物而受到惩罚。 (b) 比丘－反思他的病情很严重，生命力正在耗尽，且圣果看起来是在他力所能及的范围内－可以拒绝食物和药物，而不受惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s deliberations here show how difficult it is to legislate in this area, and there are reasons to question the way it applies the Great Standards here. Case (b) is apparently derived from SN 4:23, where Ven. Godhika takes his life and gains arahantship just moments before death; and from SN 35:87, where the Buddha says that one who puts down this body without taking up another body dies blamelessly. However, in arriving at its verdict in this case, the Commentary has to add the factors of motivation and perception to the equation, factors that are absent from the rule on which the judgment is based. It also leaves unanswered the question of how harsh the disease has to be, and how near the anticipated attainments, to qualify for this exemption.</td>
<td>《义注》中的审议显示了在这一领域制定律法是多么困难，并且有理由质疑其在此应用《四大教示》的方式。情况 (b) 显然源自<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/04.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E7%9E%BF%E6%8F%90%E8%BF%A6">《相应部》4:23经</a>，其中瞿提迦尊者在临终前自杀并证得阿罗汉果。从<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%83%E8%BB%8A%E5%8C%BF">《相应部》35:87经</a>，佛陀说，放下此身而不取他身的人，死时无可指责。然而，在对本情况做出判决时，《义注》必须将动机和感知添加到因素中，而这些因素是判决所依据的戒条中所没有的。它也没有回答这样的问题：疾病必须有多严重，以及预期的成就有多接近，才有资格获得这种豁免。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This same holds true for case (a), which entails even more dubious reasoning. The Commentary’s judgment here has no clear precedent in the Canon; there is no clear line for deciding exactly how bad the illness and how fed up the attendants have to be for this case to apply; and why should the feelings of other people determine when it is or is not allowable to refuse food?</td>
<td>对于情况（a）也是如此，它的推理更加暧昧可疑。《义注》此处的判断在《圣典》中没有明确的先例；对于这种情况的适用，没有明确的界线来确定病情的严重程度以及护理人员必须有多厌倦；而且为什么要根据别人的感受来决定何时允许或不允许拒绝食物？</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It is worth noting that the origin story to the original rule here gave the Buddha the opportunity, had he wanted it, to formulate a general rule against attempted suicides, but he chose not to. He later formulated this subsidiary rule only when a bhikkhu attempted a suicide in a way that endangered the life and safety of another person. Thus a more appropriate way of applying the Great Standards to this subsidiary rule would be to extend it only to cases of that sort: where a bhikkhu’s attempts at suicide would bring danger to another person’s life and limb.</td>
<td>值得注意的是，这里原始戒条的起源故事给了佛陀机会，如果他愿意的话，可以制定禁止试图自杀的一般戒条，但他选择不这样做。后来，只有当比丘试图以会危害他人生命和安全的方式自杀时，他才制定了这条辅助戒条。因此，将《四大教示》应用于这条辅助戒条的一个更合适的方法是仅将其扩展到此类情况：比丘的试图自杀会给另一个人的生命和肢体带来危险。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for ways of attempting suicide that do not endanger others, it seems better to follow the Buddha’s wisdom in not legislating about this issue at all, and to treat it as a matter of Dhamma rather than Vinaya. In other words, one should keep in mind his comment in SN 35:87 that the only blameless death is an arahant’s. If, lacking that attainment, one chooses to refuse food when ill to speed up one’s death, one should be heedful of the risks that death and rebirth can involve.</td>
<td>至于试图自杀而不危及他人的方式，似乎最好遵循佛陀的智慧，根本不对此议题制定律法，并将其视为「法」而不是「律」的问题。换句话说，人们应该记住他在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%83%E8%BB%8A%E5%8C%BF">《相应部》35:87经</a>中的评论，即唯一无可指责的死亡是阿罗汉的死亡。如果缺乏这种成就，在生病时选择拒绝食物以加速死亡，则应该警惕死亡和重生可能涉及的风险。</td>

Other editions of the Canon omit exemptions for a bhikkhu possessed by spirits or delirious with pain.

<tr><td>The term <em>nibbāna</em> literally means extinguishing, as of a fire. The commentarial explanation of this term that best fits the way it is used in the Canon is found at Vism.VIII,247, where Buddhaghosa derives it etymologically from <em>nir</em>, a negative prefix, and <em>vāna</em>, binding: thus, unbinding or liberation. In the physics of the Buddha’s time, fire as it burned was said to be in a state of agitation, dependence, attachment, and entrapment—both clinging to and being trapped by its sustenance. Extinguished, it was said to become calm, independent, and unattached. It let go of its sustenance and was released. In the mind’s extinguishing, or unbinding, a parallel change occurs.</td>
<td>涅槃 <em>nibbāna</em> 一词的字面意思是熄灭，如火一样。这个术语最适合它在《圣典》中的使用方式的注释解释，可以在 《清净道论》.八,247 中找到，其中<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>在词源学上从 <em>nir</em> （否定前缀）和 <em>vāna</em> （束缚）衍生出这个术语：因此，意思是解除束缚或解脱。在佛陀时代的物理学中，火在燃烧时被认为处于一种激动、依赖、执著和束缚的状态——既执著于它的维持物，又被它的维持物所束缚。据说，熄灭后，它会变得平静、独立、不执著。它放下了它的维持物并被释放了。当心熄灭，或解脱时，会发生相似的变化。</td>

Regardless of which class they fall into, however, they are all superior human states. As for the Wings to Awakening, the Commentary maintains that they count as superior human states only when developed to the level of any of the transcendent paths.

From this it would follow that if one is in doubt about one’s attainment of such a state and yet makes a definite claim to it, one would incur a pācittiya under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>.</td>
<td>与<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>的《经分别》不同，本戒条的《经分别》不考虑这样的情况：一位比丘怀疑自己的成就，却将其陈述为不容置疑的事实。这表明，《经分别》的编撰者认为这里的完全违犯只适用于比丘毫无疑问地知道他对上人法的声称是不真实的情况。由此可见，如果对自己是否达到这样一种境界有疑问，但又明确声称达到这种境界，那么就会在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>戒条下犯《波逸提》。</td>
