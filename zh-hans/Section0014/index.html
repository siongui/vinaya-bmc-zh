<tr><td><em>Santhata</em>, translated here as a felt blanket/rug, is a type of cloth described in the texts simply by its method of manufacture. Instead of being woven, it is made by strewing threads over a smooth surface, sprinkling them with a glue-like mixture made from boiled rice, using a roller to roll it smooth, and then repeating the process until the felt is thick and strong enough for one’s purposes. Although felt made like this has a number of uses, its major use in the time of the texts seems to have been as a small personal rug for sitting or lying down, or as a rough blanket for wearing around oneself when sick or cold. Blankets/rugs like this are still made and used in parts of India even today, and as the non-offense clauses to this and the following rules show, it is precisely to this type of blanket/rug that these rules apply.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/s/santhata/">Santhata</a>，这里翻译为敷具，是一种在文献中仅通过其制造方法描述的布料。它不是编织的，而是通过将线撒在光滑的表面上，撒上由煮米制成的胶状混合物，用滚筒将其滚平滑，然后重复该过程，直到敷具足够厚且坚固，为了自己的目的而使用。虽然这样制成的敷具有多种用途，但在文献的年代，它的主要用途似乎是作为坐著或躺著的小个人地毯，或作为生病或寒冷时穿在身上的粗糙毯子。即使在今天，这样的敷具仍在印度部分地区制造和使用，正如本戒条和以下戒条的不犯条款所示，这些戒条正是适用于这种类型的敷具。</td>

Noting this fact, the Commentary concludes if one is making a felt blanket/rug, and silk threads happen to float in on the breeze and land in the felt, one commits an offense all the same. Perhaps the Commentary’s interpretation here is why bhikkhus no longer use felt rugs, for there is no way of knowing whether there are any stray silk filaments in them that would make them unsuitable for use.</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>Also, as the rule indicates, there is no offense if within less than six years he makes a felt blanket/rug for his own use after being authorized to do so by the bhikkhus. The Vibhaṅga explains this by saying that the Community, if it sees fit, may formally give this authorization—a transaction with a motion and one proclamations <em>(ñatti-dutiya-kamma)</em> —to a bhikkhu who is too ill to do without a new felt blanket/rug before his six years are up. This authorization is best explained by noting that there is no exemption under this rule for a bhikkhu whose felt blanket/rug is snatched away, lost, or destroyed. Had there been such an exemption, bhikkhus might have abused it by intentionally ridding themselves of their existing felt blanket/rugs in order to get new ones. In the absence of such exemptions, if a bhikkhu’s blanket/rug is snatched away, lost, or destroyed, the Community—if they are satisfied that he did not intentionally lose it, destroy it, or put it in a place where it might easily get stolen—can give him the authorization to get a new one made.</td>
<td>此外，正如戒条所表明的，如果他在得到比丘们的授权后，在不到六年的时间里制作了一条敷具供自己使用，也不算犯戒。《经分别》解释说，如果僧团认为合适，可以正式给予这项授权——白二羯磨（一白一羯磨）<em>（ñatti-dutiya-kamma）</em>——给一位病得太重而无法在在没有新敷具的情况下做事的比丘。这项授权的最佳解释是，根据本戒条，对于敷具被抢走、丢失或毁坏的比丘来说，没有任何豁免。如果有这样的豁免，比丘们可能会滥用它，故意扔掉自己现有的敷具，以获得新的。在没有此类豁免的情况下，如果比丘的敷具被抢走、丢失或毁坏，僧团——如果他们确信他不是故意丢失、毁坏它或将其放在容易被盗的地方——可以授权他制作新的。</td>

Thus if a bhikkhu receives gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else—as when accepting a closed envelope not knowing that it contains money, or consenting to a bolt of cloth’s being placed near him, unaware that money has been placed inside it—he commits the full offense all the same. The same holds true if he is in doubt about what the envelope or bolt of cloth contains. This may seem a harsh penalty for a bhikkhu acting in complete innocence, but we must remember that, having received the money even unknowingly, he is now in possession of it and must dispose of it in a proper way. The protocols under this rule give directions for precisely how to do that.</td>

<td>文献中没有提到与此戒条相关的金佛像和供养佛像、舍利或塔的黄金物品。几个世纪以来，普遍的做法是不认为它们满足了这里的对象因素，可能是因为严格来说，佛像、佛塔和舍利不能为任何人所拥有。与给予佛像等的物品类似：从技术上讲，这些物品属于佛像等，而不属于它所在的寺院。因此，只要比丘意识到他不能拥有这些物品中的任何一件，他就可以处理它们，而不会触犯本戒条。</td>

Only in the third act is the bhikkhu’s consent required to fulfill the action, and only there is it required that the donor intend the gold or money for the bhikkhu himself.</td>

See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc84">Pc 84</a>.) According to the Commentary, a bhikkhu who accepts money wrapped up in a bolt of cloth would also commit an offense here, which shows that this act includes receiving or taking the money not only with one’s body, but also with items connected with the body. Thus accepting money in an envelope or having it placed in one’s shoulder bag as it hangs from one’s shoulder would fulfill this factor as well.</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，这包括接收作为布施提供的黄金或金钱，或拾取无主的黄金或金钱。（如不犯条款所示，此因素不包括以下情况：如果目的是为所有者妥善保管，捡起留在寺院或正在参观的房屋周围的钱的情况。参阅<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0024/#Pc84">《波逸提》八四</a>。）根据《义注》，比丘接受用布包裹的金钱也犯了本戒，这表明此行为不仅包括用自己的身体接受或拿走金钱，还包括用与身体相连的物品。因此，接受装在信封里的钱或把它放在挂在肩上的肩包里也可以满足此因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary adds the stipulation that in the taking there must be some movement of the gold or money from one place to another. It offers no explanation for this point, but it may refer to cases where the gold or money is forced on a bhikkhu. (Because the presence or absence of the bhikkhu’s consent does not enter into the definition of the act of accepting, this means that when gold or money is forced on him, the act has been accomplished.) A typical example where this stipulation is useful is when a bhikkhu is on alms round and a lay donor, against the bhikkhu’s protestations, places money in his bowl. The stipulation allows the bhikkhu simply to stand there until he gets the donor or someone else to remove the money, and he would be absolved of an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>K/《义注》增加了这样的规定：在取得过程中，黄金或金钱必须有从一处到另一处的某种移动。它没有对这一点作出解释，但它可能指的是黄金或金钱被强加给比丘的情况。（因为比丘的同意与否并不属于接受行为的定义，这意味著当黄金或金钱被强加给他时，该行为就已经完成了。）这一规定有用的典型例子是当一位比丘托钵时，一位在家人不顾比丘的抗议，将钱放入他的钵中。该规定允许比丘简单地站在那里，直到他让施主或其他人取走钱，根据本戒条，他将被免除犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The commentaries add intention as an extra factor—the full offense is entailed only if the bhikkhu is taking the gold or money for his own sake—but there is no basis for this in the Vibhaṅga. The bhikkhu’s intention in accepting the money does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s discussions of any of the three actions covered by this rule, the donor’s intent does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s definition of this action, and the non-offense clauses do not allow for a bhikkhu to accept money for others, so the added factor seems unwarranted. Whether the bhikkhu accepts gold or money for himself or for others is thus not an issue here.</td>
<td>注释书中加入了意图作为一个额外的因素——只有当比丘为了自己的利益而获取黄金或金钱时，才构成完全的犯戒——但在《经分别》中没有这方面的依据。比丘接受金钱的意图不属于《经分别》对本戒条所涵盖的三种行为中任何一种的讨论，布施者的意图不属于《经分别》对此行为的定义，并且不犯条款不允许比丘为他人接受金钱，所以增加的因素似乎没有根据。因此，比丘是否为自己或他人接受黄金或金钱在这里并不是问题。</td>

Thus simply telling the donor that X is the bhikkhus’ steward—or that the monastery’s stewards have placed a donation box in such-and-such a place—would not be a factor for an offense here. Also, if the donor—over the bhikkhu’s protestations—leaves money, say, on a table as a gift for a bhikkhu, then if the bhikkhu tells his steward what the donor did and said, without telling the steward to do anything with the money—letting the steward figure things out on his/her own—this too would not entail a penalty. The Commentary’s discussion of stewards under the next point shows that while a bhikkhu who tells a volunteer steward to put such a donation in a donation box would incur a penalty, a bhikkhu who simply points out the donation box would not.</td>

Refusing in thought means thinking, “This is not proper for me.” Refusing in word means telling the donor that such a gift is not allowable. Refusing in deed means making a gesture to the same effect. If one refuses in any of these ways—e.g., one wants to accept the gold or money, but tells the donor that it is not allowable; or one says nothing, but simply reminds oneself that such gifts are not proper to accept—one avoids the penalty here.</td>

<tr><td>The question of whether it is best to express one’s refusal outwardly lies beyond the scope of the Vinaya and often depends on the situation. Ideally, one should inform the donor so that he/she will know enough not to present such gifts in the future, but there are cases where the donor is still new to the idea of rules and will simply be offended if the bhikkhu objects to what he/she means as a well-intentioned gesture. This is thus a matter where a bhikkhu should use his discretion.</td>
<td>是否最好从外表上表达拒绝的问题超出了戒律的范围，而且往往取决于具体情况。理想情况下，应该告知布施者，以便他/她知道将来不要做此类布施，但在某些情况下，布施者对戒条的概念仍然很陌生，如果比丘反对他/她所表达的善意行动，布施者只会感到被冒犯。因此，这是比丘应该运用自己的判断力的问题。</td>

If someone else comes along and asks the bhikkhu, “What is this?”, the bhikkhu may tell him/her what he and the donor said, but may not ask him/her to do anything about it. If the person volunteers to put the gold or money into safekeeping, the bhikkhu may point out a safe place but may not tell him/her to put it there.</td>

<tr><td>There is some controversy over the status of checks under this rule. In legal terms, a check is a notice to a bank to provide funds for the payee. Because banks are corporate individuals and not “places,” a check made out to a bhikkhu is thus equivalent to a notice from a donor to a steward to provide funds on the bhikkhu’s behalf. Because the funds in question do not change ownership until the recipient cashes the check, this strengthens the similarity to funds placed with a steward: The funds still belong to the donor until they are used, and the steward is responsible if they become lost in the meantime. Thus the simple act of receiving a check counts not as an act of receiving money but as an acknowledgement of the notice. In passing the notice to someone else, one is simply informing them of the donor’s arrangement. Only if a bhikkhu cashes a check or gives an order to someone else to do so does he commit an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>对于本戒条下的支票的地位存在一些争议。从法律角度来说，支票是银行向收款人提供资金的通知。因为银行是法人个体而非「场所」，所以开给比丘的支票相当于布施者向净人发出的代替比丘提供资金的通知。由于相关资金在收款人兑现支票之前不会改变所有权，因此这增强了存放与净人的资金的相似性：资金在使用之前仍属于布施者，如果资金在使用过程中丢失，则净人负责。因此，仅接收支票的行为不算是接收金钱的行为，而是对通知的确认。将通知传递给其他人时，只是告知他们布施者的安排。只有当比丘兑现支票或命令其他人这样做时，他才犯下本戒条。</td>

<tr><td>Monetary exchange refers primarily to the type of business and speculation a gold dealer would engage in—exchanging currency, trading gold ore for gold shaped into ornaments or vice versa, trading gold ore for gold ore, or gold ornaments for gold ornaments—but the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of perception shows that the factor of effort here includes any exchange in which the bhikkhu ends up with gold or money as a result of the exchange. Thus it would cover cases where a bhikkhu sells any kind of item—allowable or unallowable—for money.</td>
<td>金钱兑换主要是指黄金交易商从事的业务和投机买卖类型——兑换货币、用金矿石换黄金饰品，反之亦然、用金矿石换金矿石、或者用金饰品换金饰品——但《经分别》对感知因素的讨论表明，这里的努力因素包括比丘最终得到黄金或金钱作为交换结果的任何交换。因此，它涵盖了比丘为了金钱而出售任何种类的物品——无论是允许的还是不允许的——的情况。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At first glance, this rule would seem redundant with the preceding rule against receiving money and the following rule against engaging in trade, but actually it closes a number of loopholes in those rules. In the preceding rule, a bhikkhu may point out a steward to a person who brings money intended for him; and in the following rule he can, if he words it right, propose a trade or tell a steward to arrange a trade for him. Thus, given just those two rules, it would be possible for a bhikkhu using “proper” procedures to have his steward engage in currency speculation and other money-making activities without committing an offense.</td>
<td>乍看之下，与前面的禁止接受金钱的戒条和后面的禁止从事贸易的戒条，本戒条似乎是多余的，但实际上它弥补了这些戒条中的一些漏洞。在前条戒条中，比丘可以向为他带来金钱的人指出一名净人；在后面的戒条中，如果他表达正确，他可以提出交易或告诉净人为他安排交易。因此，只有这两条戒条，比丘就有可能使用「适当」的程序让他的净人从事货币投机买卖和其他赚钱活动而不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This rule, though, includes no such exceptions for “wording things right <em>(kappiya-vohāra)</em>,” and so closes those loopholes as far as this type of trading is concerned. As a result, a bhikkhu may not express a desire to his steward that he/she sell something belonging to him or take funds dedicated for his use and invest them for monetary return. If the bhikkhu is going abroad, he must leave it up to his steward to figure out that any funds donated for his use may have to be exchanged for foreign currency if they are going to serve any purpose.</td>
<td>不过，本戒条不包括「措辞正确<em>（kappiya-vohāra）</em>」的例外情况，因此就此类交易而言，堵住了这些漏洞。结果，比丘不能向他的净人表达，让他/她出售属于他的东西，或拿专用于他的资金并投资以获取金钱回报的愿望。如果比丘要出国，他必须让他的净人自己弄清楚，供他使用的任何布施资金如果要发挥任何作用，可能必须兑换成外币。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, the item offered in exchange must be one’s own if the exchange is to fall under this rule, but the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clauses make no exemptions for a bhikkhu who engages in monetary exchange using items belonging to anyone else. Thus if a bhikkhu were to arrange a monetary exchange using goods belonging to his family, he would have to forfeit any proceeds from the exchange that they might offer to him.</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，如果交换符合本戒条，则提供的交换物品必须是自己的，但《经分别》的不犯条款对于使用属于其他人的物品进行金钱兑换的比丘没有豁免。因此，如果比丘要使用属于他家人的物品进行金钱兑换，他将不得不放弃他们可能提供给他的任何兑换收益。</td>

Thus, when receiving gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else or is in doubt about the matter, he would still be fulfilling the factor of effort.

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, monetary exchange refers to any trade in which money is involved—whether as the item the bhikkhu brings into the trade, gets out of the trade, or both. Buddhaghosa states that this interpretation is based on a passage that is not in the Vibhaṅga but logically should be. The Sub-commentary supports him, explaining that if monetary exchange covers trades in which money forms one side of the trade, it shouldn’t matter which side of the trade it is on.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，金钱交换是指任何涉及金钱的交易——无论是比丘将物品带入交易、带出交易，或两者兼而有之。<em>佛音</em>指出，这种解释所依据的一段话不在《经分别》中，但逻辑上应该是。《复注》支持他，解释说如果金钱交换涵盖金钱构成交易一方的交易，那么金钱属于交易的哪一方并不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This, however, contradicts a number of points in the Vibhaṅga. (1) Its table of the possible actions covered by this rule includes only cases where the outcome of the trade for the bhikkhu is money. As we noted in the Introduction, we have to trust that the Vibhaṅga arrangers knew what was and was not an offense under a certain rule, and that if they had meant the rule to cover more than the alternatives listed in the table they would have included them. (2) In the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of how the forfeiture is to be conducted, it consistently refers to the offender as the “one who purchased money” and to the bhikkhu who throws the forfeited object away as the “money-disposer.” (3) If <em>monetary exchange</em> covers cases where the bhikkhu uses money to buy allowable things, then the discussion of how a bhikkhu could get his steward to use money rightfully placed with the steward to buy such things would have been included under this rule; instead, it is included under the following rule. All of this seems to indicate that the Commentary is on shaky ground when it tries to force its interpretation on the Vibhaṅga here.</td>
<td>然而，这与《经分别》中的许多观点相矛盾。（1）本戒条涵盖的可能行动表格仅包括比丘交易的结果是金钱的情况。正如我们在<strong>引言</strong>中指出的，我们必须相信《经分别》编排者知道在特定戒条下什么是犯戒，什么不是犯戒，并且如果他们想让该戒条涵盖比表格中列出的替代方案更多的内容，他们就会包括他们。（2）《经分别》在讨论如何进行舍出时，始终将犯戒者称为「购买金钱的人」，并将扔掉舍出物品的比丘称为「金钱处置者」。（3）如果<em>金钱兑换</em>涵盖比丘用金钱购买允许的物品的情况，那么比丘如何让他的净人使用正确存放在净人那里的金钱来购买这些物品的讨论就包含在本戒条中；相反，它包含在下一个戒条中。所有这些似乎都表明，当《义注》试图将其解释强加于此处的《经分别》时，它的基础是不稳固的。</td>

<tr><td>At any rate, to continue with the Commentary’s explanations: N.O. → A.O. trades cover two possible cases, depending on whether the money was obtained properly or improperly under the preceding rule. If improperly, the object bought with the money is unallowable for all bhikkhus. This holds whether the bhikkhu makes the purchase himself or a steward makes it for him. The only way the item can be made allowable is to have an equal sum of money returned to the original donor and the item returned to the person who sold it, and then arrange for a proper exchange as allowed under the following rule. (At first glance, it may seem strange for the Commentary to insist that the price of the A.O. be returned to the original donor of the N.O., as the bhikkhus are in no way in his/her debt; but this is probably the Commentary’s way of ensuring that if the seller returns the purchase price of the A.O. to the bhikkhus’ steward, it is not used to repurchase the A.O.)</td>
<td>无论如何，继续《义注》的解释：《尼萨耆》物件→ 允许物件交易涵盖两种可能的情况，取决于根据上一个戒条是否适当地或不适当地获得金钱。如果不适当，用金钱购买的物品对于所有比丘来说都是不允许的。无论是比丘自己购买还是净人为他购买，这都是成立的。使该物品获得允许的唯一方法是将等额的钱退还给原始布施者，并将该物品退还给出售该物品的人，然后根据下一个戒条安排适当的交换。（乍看之下，《义注》坚持将允许物件的价格归还给《尼萨耆》物件的原来布施者似乎很奇怪，因为比丘们绝不欠他/她的债；但这可能是《义注》的方式，以确保如果卖方将允许物件的购买价格退还给比丘的净人，则该金额不会用于重新购买该允许物件）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, a bhikkhu engages in a N.O. → A.O. trade using money obtained properly under the preceding rule, the item bought is unallowable only for him, but allowable for other bhikkhus once he has forfeited it. If N.O. → A.O. exchanges really were covered by this rule, though, this would contradict the Vibhaṅga, which insists that the item obtained as a result of this rule either has to be given to a lay person or thrown away. Thus it seems better to follow the Vibhaṅga in treating cases of this sort under the following rule.</td>
<td>然而，如果比丘从事《尼萨耆》物件→ 允许物件交易，使用根据上一个戒条适当地获得的金钱时，所购买的物品仅对他来说是不允许的，但一旦他舍出了该物品，其他比丘就可以使用。尽管，如果《尼萨耆》物件→ 允许物件交换确实被本戒条涵盖，但这与《经分别》相矛盾，《经分别》坚持认为，由于本戒条而获得的物品要么必须给予居士，要么被扔掉。因此，在对待此类案例时，最好遵循下一个戒条的《经分别》。</td>

Because there is no way to undo these transactions—the iron can never be returned to its state as ore—there is no way any bhikkhu may ever properly make use of the iron no matter what is done with it.</td>
<td>作为一项智力练习，《义注》考虑了导致永远不能被获得允许的允许物件的交易问题，并提出了以下情况：一位比丘拿了根据上一个戒条不适当获得的金钱，用它来开采、熔炼铁，并制成钵。因为没有办法还原这些处置——铁永远无法恢复到矿石状态——所以任何比丘都无法适当地使用该铁，无论用它做了什么。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>various types of trade</em> as covering deals involving the four requisites, “even a lump of powder, tooth wood, or unwoven thread”—these being its standard examples of objects with the least possible material value. The Commentary interprets this definition as limiting this rule to deals involving nothing but allowable objects (A.O. → A.O.), but there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to suggest that this is necessarily so. The emphasis in the Vibhaṅga seems to be that this rule covers even allowable objects of the least possible value, and all the more so more valuable and restricted objects. In fact, as the Vibhaṅga explicitly limits the preceding rule to trades that result in money for the bhikkhu (N.O. → N.O.; D.O. → N.O.; A.O. → N.O.), it seems best to interpret this rule as covering all types of trade not covered in that rule:</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga, in its description of what constitutes a trade, makes reference to “one’s own” object going to the hand of the other, and the other’s object going to one’s own hand. From this, the K/Commentary deduces that the object given in trade has to be one’s own personal possession. This deduction, however, is mistaken for several reasons: (1) The Vibhaṅga’s protocols under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> do not allow one to tell a steward to use the funds placed in his care to buy or barter for anything, and yet these funds do not belong to the bhikkhu. (2) The Vibhaṅga’s protocols for disposing of money under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">NP 18</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP19">19</a> do not allow a bhikkhu to tell a lay person to buy anything with the money forfeited by the offender under those rules, and again this money does not belong to the bhikkhu. (3) The non-offense clauses to this rule make no exemptions for a bhikkhu who trades using goods belonging to someone else. Thus it would appear that the phrase, “one’s own” goods, in the Vibhaṅga’s description of a trade, is defined simply in opposition to the phrase, “the other person’s” goods prior to the trade. In other words, it would cover anything that starts out on one’s side before the trade, whether those items are one’s own personal possessions or another person’s possessions that have been placed in deposit for one’s use (such as funds placed with a steward) or in one’s keeping (such as monastery funds placed under the supervision of a monastery official).</td>
<td>《经分别》在描述贸易的组成时，提到了「自己的」物品到达另一个人的手中，以及另一个人的物品到达自己的手中。由此，K/《义注》推论出交易中所给予的物品必须是自己的个人财产。然而，这种推论是错误的，原因如下：（1）<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>下的《经分别》行仪不允许告诉净人使用放在他照料下的资金来购买或交换任何东西，甚至这些资金不属于至比丘。（2）根据<a class="reference external" href="#NP18">《舍堕》一八</a>和<a class="reference external" href="#NP19">一九</a>的《经分别》规定的金钱处置行仪不允许比丘告诉在家人用犯戒者根据那些戒条舍出的钱来购买任何东西，而且这笔钱也不属于比丘。（3）本戒条的不犯条款对于使用属于他人的货物进行交易的比丘没有豁免。因此，在《经分别》对贸易的描述中，在交易之前，此用语「自己的」货物的定义似乎与「他人的」货物的用语相对立。换句话说，它涵盖交易前，某一方开始的任何物品，无论那些物品是自己的个人财产，还是他人存放供自己使用的财产（例如存放在净人处的资金）或由某人保管（例如由寺院执事监督的寺院资金）。</td>

<tr><td>1) The bhikkhu proposes an exchange, saying, “Give this for that,” or “Take this for that,” or “Exchange this for that,” or “Purchase this with that.” Because the non-offense clauses make no exemption for exchanges conducted by gesture, any gesture—including a written message or sign language—that clearly makes this proposal would fulfill this step.</td>
<td>1）比丘提议交换，说：「以这个换那个」，或者「拿这个换那个」，或者「用这个换那个」，或者「用那个买这个」。因为不犯条款并没有豁免透过示意动作进行的交流，任何明确提出这项建议的示意动作（包括书面讯息或手语）都将完成这一步骤。</td>

<tr><td>The first step entails a dukkaṭa; both steps together, a nissaggiya pācittiya. Perception is not a mitigating factor here: If a bhikkhu manages an exchange in a way that he thinks avoids a penalty under this rule but in fact doesn’t (see below), he commits the full offense all the same. If, on the other hand, he manages an exchange in such a way that would avoid a penalty under this rule but he thinks that it falls under the rule or else is in doubt about the matter, he incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>第一步犯《突吉罗》；两个步骤都完成，则犯《尼萨耆波逸提》（《舍堕》）。在这里，感知并不是减轻惩罚的因素：如果比丘以一种他认为可以避免根据本戒条受到惩罚的方式管理交易，但实际上却没有（见下文），那么他仍然完违犯本戒条。另一方面，如果他以避免根据本戒条受到惩罚的方式管理交易，但他认为该交易属于本戒条的范围，或者对此事有疑问，那么他犯《突吉罗》。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, in discussing these exemptions, raises the following points:</td>
<td>《义注》在讨论这些豁免时提出了以下几点：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1) A bhikkhu who tries to avoid the technicalities of what is defined as engaging in trading by saying simply, “Give this. Take that,” may do so only with his parents. Otherwise, telling a lay person to take one’s belongings as his/her own is to “bring a gift of faith <em>(saddhā-deyya)</em> to waste”—i.e., to misuse the donations that lay supporters, out of faith, have sacrificed for the bhikkhu’s use (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#Mv.VIII.22.1">Mv.VIII.22.1</a>; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">BMC2, Chapter 10</a>). On the other hand, telling an unrelated lay person to give something is a form of begging, which carries a dukkaṭa unless the lay person is related or has invited one to ask in the first place. (From this we may deduce that bhikkhus should not bargain after having asked the price of goods or services—e.g., a taxi fare—even in situations where bargaining is the norm.)</td>
<td>1）比丘试图透过仅仅说：「给这个。拿那个」，来避免参与交易的技术细节，只可对他的父母这样做。否则，告诉在家人将自己的财物据为己有，就是「浪费信施<em>（saddhā-deyya）</em>」，即滥用在家人出于信仰牺牲而为比丘使用的捐款。（见 <a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_008#0386a05">《大品》.八.22.1</a>；<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0049.html#BMC2chapter10">《佛教比丘戒律 第二册》第十章</a>）。另一方面，告诉非亲戚的在家人给予东西是一种乞讨的形式，除非该居士有亲戚关系或一开始就邀请自己提出请求，否则就会犯《突吉罗》。（由此我们可以推断，即使在讨价还价是常态的情况下，比丘在询问商品或服务的价格（例如计程车费）后也不应该讨价还价。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>2) Under the previous rule, the Commentary mentioned that a bhikkhu engaging in an otherwise allowable trade for profit incurs a dukkaṭa. Here it says that if a bhikkhu, proposing a trade by wording it right <em>(kappiya-vohāra)</em>, deceives the seller as to the value of his goods, he is to be treated under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>. However, as the Vibhaṅga to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a> indicates, goods received through deceit are to be treated not under that rule but under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>.</td>
<td>2）根据先前的戒条，《义注》提到，比丘从事其他允许的获利贸易会犯《突吉罗》。这里它说，如果一个比丘以正确的措辞<em>（kappiya-vohāra）</em>提出交易，在其货物的价值上欺骗卖家，他将根据<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr2">《波罗夷》二</a>来处理。然而，正如<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0010/#Pr2">《波罗夷》二</a>的《经分别》所指出的那样，透过欺骗收到的货物不应根据该戒条处理，而应根据<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0016/#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>来处理。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>3) In the case of “telling a steward,” both the Commentary and K/Commentary deem it allowable to tell the steward, “Having gotten that with this, give it (to me).” This, however, is a clear violation of the protocols set forth by the Vibhaṅga under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>, according to which a bhikkhu is not allowed to speak in the imperative, giving the command, “Give,” to a steward, much less a command to barter or buy. Instead, he is allowed to speak only in the declarative: “I have need of such-and-such,” or “I want such-and-such.” Declarative statements of this sort would thus appear to be the only statements allowed under this non-offense clause as well.</td>
<td>3）在「告诉净人」的情况下，《义注》和 K/《义注》都认为可以告诉净人，「用这个得到了那个，把它（给我）。」然而，这明显违反了《经分别》在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>下制定的行仪，根据该行仪，比丘不得以命令方式说话，向净人发出「给予」的命令，更不用说以物易物或购买的命令。相反地，他只能用陈述句说话：「我需要某某」或「我想要某某」。因此，此类声明性陈述似乎也是本不犯条款下唯一允许的陈述。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>4) If a bhikkhu goes with his steward to a store and sees that the steward is getting a bad deal, he may simply tell the steward, “Don’t take it.”</td>
<td>4）如果比丘和他的净人去一家商店，发现净人的交易很糟糕，他可以坦白地告诉净人：「不要拿。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>5) The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> describes how a bhikkhu may make a purchase when his steward has left funds in safe-keeping on the bhikkhu’s premises but is not present to arrange a trade when, say, a bowl-seller comes along. The bhikkhu may tell the seller, “I want this bowl, and there are funds of equal value here, but there is no steward to make them allowable.” If the seller volunteers to make them allowable, the bhikkhu may show him where they are but may not tell him how much to take. If the seller takes too much, the bhikkhu may cancel the sale by saying, “I don’t want your bowl after all.”</td>
<td>5）<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>的《义注》描述了当比丘的净人将资金留在比丘的处所保管，却没有在场安排交易时，比丘可以如何进行购买，例如说，当卖钵的人出现时。比丘可以告诉卖家：「我想要这个钵，这里有等值的资金，但没有净人使它们成为允许的。」如果卖家自愿使它们成为允许的，比丘可以告诉他它们在哪里，但不可告诉他要拿多少。如果卖家拿走太多，比丘可以取消买卖，说：「我还是不要你的钵。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In general it is not a wise policy to have funds left for safe-keeping on one’s premises—a Community allowing this exposes itself to the dangers of robbery and assault—but the Commentary here seems less interested in describing ideal behavior than in simply drawing the line between what is and is not an offense.</td>
<td>一般来说，将资金留在自己的处所保管不是一个明智之举——一个允许这样做的僧团会让自己面临抢劫和袭击的危险——但这里的《义注》似乎对描述理想行为不太感兴趣，而仅仅只是区分什么是犯戒和什么不是犯戒。</td>

<td>1）比丘尼的<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N02n0001_011#0341a02">《舍堕》戒条四-十</a>表明，如果在家布施者给店主钱以支付比丘尼向商店提出的任何要求，比丘尼可以利用这种安排。如果布施者规定这种安排只适用于某些物品，或价值一定金额的物品，她只可以要求符合规定的物品：这是戒条的要点。实际上，这样做是让店主成为她的净人。因此，这样的安排对比丘来说似乎也是被允许的，只要他们按照<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#NP10">《舍堕》十</a>的建议，用适当的措辞向店主表达他们的要求。</td>

<tr><td>2) As mentioned under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0014.html#NP18">NP 18</a>, checks, credit cards, debit cards, and traveler’s checks do not count as gold or money. However, any trade arranged with them would come under this rule.</td>
<td>2）如<a class="reference external" href="#NP18">《舍堕》一八</a>所述，支票、信用卡、金融卡和旅行支票不算黄金或金钱。然而，用他们安排的任何交易都将受到本戒条的约束。</td>

<tr><td>In cases where an actual physical item is handed over to the seller in the course of such a trade, the trade is accomplished in the physical exchange, with no need to wait for funds to enter the seller’s account for the offense to be incurred. This is because “object” under this rule can be fulfilled by an item of the least inherent monetary value.</td>
<td>如果在交易过程中将实体物品移交给卖方，交易是在实体交易所完成的，无需等待资金进入卖方帐户即可算犯戒。这是因为本戒条下的「对象」可以透过内在货币价值最低的物品来实现。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>For instance, if a bhikkhu hands a check to a seller—or tells his steward to hand it over—in exchange for goods or services in the manner specified by this rule, he would commit the full offense the moment the check and goods change hands.</td>
<td>例如，如果比丘将一张支票交给卖家，或告诉他的净人将其交给卖家，以按照本戒条所述的方式换取货物或服务，那么在支票和货物易手的那一刻，他就完全违犯本戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Similarly with credit cards: The offense is committed when the bhikkhu hands the signed credit card receipt—or has it handed—to the seller and receives goods or services in return. The receipt is an acknowledgement of the goods or services received from the seller, which in the context of the cardholder’s agreement with the credit card company is his promise to repay the loan he is taking out with the company. This promise is what the bhikkhu is trading with the seller, who will then use it to draw funds from the company’s account.</td>
<td>信用卡也类似：当比丘将签署的信用卡收据（或令其）交给卖方并收到商品或服务作为回报时，即构成犯戒。收据是对从卖方收到的商品或服务的确认，在持卡人与信用卡公司达成协议的背景下，收据是持卡人偿还向该公司借出的贷款的承诺。这个承诺就是比丘与卖家交易的东西，然后卖家将用它从公司的帐户中提取资金。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, no physical item is handed over to the seller, the trade is not accomplished until funds enter the seller’s account. An example would be a debit card: The full offense is committed only when, after pushing the personal identification number (PIN)—which is his order to the bank to pay the seller—the bhikkhu receives goods and services from the seller, and funds are transferred to the seller’s account from his.</td>
<td>但是，如果没有将实物移交给卖方，则在资金进入卖方帐户之前交易不会完成。签帐金融卡（debit card）就是这样的例子：只有当比丘输入个人识别码（PIN）（这是他命令银行付款给卖方）后，比丘从卖方收到商品和服务，以及资金从他的帐户转入卖家的帐户时，才构成完整犯戒。</td>
