<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>gold</em> so as to include anything made of gold. <em>Silver</em> it defines to cover coins made of silver, copper, wood, or lac, or whatever is used as a currency. The Commentary adds such examples as bones, pieces of hide, fruit, and seeds of trees used as currency, whether they have been stamped with a figure or not. At present, the term would include coins and paper currency, as well as money orders and cashiers checks not made out to a specific payee, as these meet all three requirements of a currency: (1) They are a generally accepted medium of exchange; (2) they are of standard recognized value; and (3) they are presentable by any bearer. The following items, because they do not fulfill all three of these requirements, would not count as “silver” under this rule: money orders and cashier’s checks made out to a specific payee; personal checks and travelers’ checks; credit cards and debit cards; gift cards, phone cards, frequent flyer miles; food stamps; and promissory notes.</td>
<td>《经分别》对<em>金</em>的定义<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0337a06">包括所有黄金制成的东西</a>。它定义的「<em>银</em>」<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_004#0337a07">包括由银、铜、木头、树胶或任何用作货币的物质制成的硬币</a>。《义注》添加了用作货币的骨头、兽皮碎片、水果和树种等例子，无论它们是否带有数字印记。目前，该术语包括硬币和纸币，以及未开给特定收款人的汇票和银行本票，因为它们满足货币的所有三个要求：（1）它们是普遍接受的交换媒介；（2）具有标准认可价值；（3）任何持有者均可出示。以下物品，因为不符合所有这三个要求，因此根据本戒条不能算作「银」：开给特定收款人的汇票和银行本票；个人支票和旅行支票；信用卡和金融卡；礼品卡、电话卡、飞行常客哩程；食品券；和<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AC%E7%A5%A8">期票（本票）</a>。</td>

<tr><td>Because the word <em>silver</em> here functionally means “money,” that is how I will translate it for the remainder of the discussion of this rule.</td>
<td>因为这里的“银”这个词在功能上意味著“金钱”，所以我将在本戒条的其余讨论中对其进行翻译。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga indicates that perception is not a mitigating factor in either offense. Thus if a bhikkhu receives gold or money, even if he perceives it as something else—as when accepting a closed envelope not knowing that it contains money, or consenting to a bolt of cloth’s being placed near him, unaware that money has been placed inside it—he commits the full offense all the same. The same holds true if he is in doubt about what the envelope or bolt of cloth contains. This may seem a harsh penalty for a bhikkhu acting in complete innocence, but we must remember that, having received the money even unknowingly, he is now in possession of it and must dispose of it in a proper way. The protocols under this rule give directions for precisely how to do that.</td>
<td>《经分别》指出，感知并不是这两种犯戒的减轻因素。因此，如果比丘收到黄金或金钱，即使他将其视为其他东西，例如当他接受一个封闭的信封时，并不知道里面装有金钱，或者同意将一块布匹放在他附近，但不知道里面已经放入金钱了，他仍然完全违犯此戒。如果他对信封或布匹的内容有疑问，这同样成立。对于一个完全无辜的比丘来说，这似乎是一个严厉的惩罚，但我们必须记住，即使在不知情的情况下收到了这笔钱，他现在也拥有了这笔钱，并且必须以适当的方式处置它。本戒条下的行仪给出了具体如何做到这一点的指示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If a bhikkhu accepts or consents to the placing of something that is not gold or money and yet he perceives it to be gold or money or is in doubt about its status, he incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>如果比丘接受或同意放置非黄金或金钱的东西，但他认为它是黄金或金钱或对其状态有疑问，他就会犯《突吉罗》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Gold Buddha images and gold items given to Buddha images, relics, or stūpas are not mentioned in the texts in connection with this rule. Over the centuries the common practice has been not to regard them as fulfilling the factor of object here, probably because Buddha images, stūpas, and relics, strictly speaking, cannot be owned by anyone. Similarly with items given to a Buddha image, etc.: Technically, these belong to the image, etc., and not to the monastery in which it may be located. Thus, as long as a bhikkhu realizes that he cannot assume ownership of any of these things, he may handle them without incurring an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>文献中没有提到与此戒条相关的金佛像和供养佛像、舍利或塔的黄金物品。几个世纪以来，普遍的做法是不认为它们满足了这里的对象因素，可能是因为严格来说，佛像、佛塔和舍利不能为任何人所拥有。与给予佛像等的物品类似：从技术上讲，这些物品属于佛像等，而不属于它所在的寺院。因此，只要比丘意识到他不能拥有这些物品中的任何一件，他就可以处理它们，而不会触犯本戒条。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As mentioned under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>, the Commentary derives from the Canon a list of items that it says carry a dukkaṭa when accepted by a bhikkhu. These include pearls and precious stones; uncooked grain and raw meat; women and girls, male and female slaves; goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares; fields and property. For convenience’s sake, we will refer to these items from here on as dukkaṭa objects <em>(dukkaṭa-vatthu)</em>, or D.O. for short.</td>

<tr><td>This factor may be fulfilled by any of three actions: accepting gold or money, having it accepted, or consenting to its being deposited. As noted above, the factors of the offense differ among the three: In the first two, the question of whether the bhikkhu consents to the gold or money does not enter into the definition of the act, nor does the donor’s intention as to who the gold or money is for. Only in the third act is the bhikkhu’s consent required to fulfill the action, and only there is it required that the donor intend the gold or money for the bhikkhu himself.</td>
<td>这个因素可以透过以下三种行为中的任何一种来实现：接受黄金或金钱、让其被接受，或同意将其存放。如上所述，这三种犯戒的因素有所不同：在前两种情况下，比丘是否同意黄金或金钱的问题不属于该行为的定义，布施者对于黄金或金钱是给谁的意图也不属于。只有在第三种行为中，才需要比丘同意才能完成该行动，并且只有在布施者打算将黄金或金钱送给比丘本人时才需要。</td>

<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, this includes receiving gold or money offered as a gift or picking up gold or money left lying around ownerless. (As the non-offense clauses show, this factor does not cover cases where one picks up money left lying around the monastery or a house where one is visiting if one’s purpose is to keep it in safekeeping for the owner. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc84">Pc 84</a>.) According to the Commentary, a bhikkhu who accepts money wrapped up in a bolt of cloth would also commit an offense here, which shows that this act includes receiving or taking the money not only with one’s body, but also with items connected with the body. Thus accepting money in an envelope or having it placed in one’s shoulder bag as it hangs from one’s shoulder would fulfill this factor as well.</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，这包括接收作为布施提供的黄金或金钱，或拾取无主的黄金或金钱。（如不犯条款所示，此因素不包括以下情况：如果目的是为所有者妥善保管，捡起留在寺院或正在参观的房屋周围的钱的情况。参阅<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc84">《波逸提》八四</a>。）根据《义注》，比丘接受用布包裹的金钱也犯了本戒，这表明此行为不仅包括用自己的身体接受或拿走金钱，还包括用与身体相连的物品。因此，接受装在信封里的钱或把它放在挂在肩上的肩包里也可以满足此因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary adds the stipulation that in the taking there must be some movement of the gold or money from one place to another. It offers no explanation for this point, but it may refer to cases where the gold or money is forced on a bhikkhu. (Because the presence or absence of the bhikkhu’s consent does not enter into the definition of the act of accepting, this means that when gold or money is forced on him, the act has been accomplished.) A typical example where this stipulation is useful is when a bhikkhu is on alms round and a lay donor, against the bhikkhu’s protestations, places money in his bowl. The stipulation allows the bhikkhu simply to stand there until he gets the donor or someone else to remove the money, and he would be absolved of an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>K/《义注》增加了这样的规定：在取得过程中，黄金或金钱必须有从一处到另一处的某种移动。它没有对这一点作出解释，但它可能指的是黄金或金钱被强加给比丘的情况。（因为比丘的同意与否并不属于接受行为的定义，这意味著当黄金或金钱被强加给他时，该行为就已经完成了。）这一规定有用的典型例子是当一位比丘托钵时，一位在家人不顾比丘的抗议，将钱放入他的钵中。该规定允许比丘简单地站在那里，直到他让施主或其他人取走钱，根据本戒条，他将被免除犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The commentaries add intention as an extra factor—the full offense is entailed only if the bhikkhu is taking the gold or money for his own sake—but there is no basis for this in the Vibhaṅga. The bhikkhu’s intention in accepting the money does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s discussions of any of the three actions covered by this rule, the donor’s intent does not enter into the Vibhaṅga’s definition of this action, and the non-offense clauses do not allow for a bhikkhu to accept money for others, so the added factor seems unwarranted. Whether the bhikkhu accepts gold or money for himself or for others is thus not an issue here.</td>
<td>注释书中加入了意图作为一个额外的因素——只有当比丘为了自己的利益而获取黄金或金钱时，才构成完全的犯戒——但在《经分别》中没有这方面的依据。比丘接受金钱的意图不属于《经分别》对本戒条所涵盖的三种行为中任何一种的讨论，布施者的意图不属于《经分别》对此行为的定义，并且不犯条款不允许比丘为他人接受金钱，所以增加的因素似乎没有根据。因此，比丘是否为自己或他人接受黄金或金钱在这里并不是问题。</td>

Examples from the commentaries, which draw on the protocols under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>, include such things as telling the donor to give the money to a steward, telling the donor that so-and-so will take the money for him; telling the steward to take the money, to put it in a donation box, to “do what he thinks appropriate,” or any similar command.</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，接受黄金或金钱包括让其他人执行接受所涵盖的任何行动，如上所述。注释书中的例子借鉴了<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#np10">《舍堕》十</a>下的行仪，包括告诉布施者将钱交给<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA">净人</a>、告诉布施者某某会替他拿走这笔钱；告诉净人拿走钱，将其放入捐款箱（功德箱），「做他认为合适的事情」，或任何类似的命令。</td>

<tr><td>Anything that falls short of a command, though, would not fulfill this factor, as we have already seen under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>. Thus simply telling the donor that X is the bhikkhus’ steward—or that the monastery’s stewards have placed a donation box in such-and-such a place—would not be a factor for an offense here. Also, if the donor—over the bhikkhu’s protestations—leaves money, say, on a table as a gift for a bhikkhu, then if the bhikkhu tells his steward what the donor did and said, without telling the steward to do anything with the money—letting the steward figure things out on his/her own—this too would not entail a penalty. The Commentary’s discussion of stewards under the next point shows that while a bhikkhu who tells a volunteer steward to put such a donation in a donation box would incur a penalty, a bhikkhu who simply points out the donation box would not.</td>
<td>然而，任何不符合命令的事情都不会满足这个因素，正如我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#np10">《舍堕》十</a>中已经看到的那样。因此，仅仅告诉施主 X 是比丘的净人──或是寺院的净人在某处放置了一个捐款箱（功德箱）──在这里并不会构成犯戒的因素。另外，如果施主不顾比丘的抗议，比如说，将钱留在桌上作为给比丘的布施，那么如果比丘告诉他的净人，施主做了什么和说过什么，但没有告诉净人如何处理这笔钱——让净人自己解决问题——这也不会带来惩罚。《义注》在下一点中对净人的讨论表明，虽然比丘告诉志愿者净人将此类捐款放入捐款箱（功德箱）会受到处罚，但比丘只是指出捐款箱（功德箱）则不会受到处罚。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>2) The donor tells him, “I have some gold or money deposited in such-and-such a location. It’s yours.” (One of the implications of this second case is that any monastery with a donation box should make clear that money left in the box is being placed with the steward. Because <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> allows a donor to place gold or money intended for a bhikkhu’s needs with a steward, the act of placing money with such a person in a bhikkhu’s presence does not count as “depositing” here.)</td>
<td>2) 布施者告诉他：「我在某处存放了一些黄金或金钱。是你的。」（此第二个案例的含义之一是，任何设有捐款箱（功德箱）的寺院都应明确表示，箱中的钱存放在净人那里。因为<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#np10">《舍堕》十</a>允许布施者将用于比丘需要的黄金或金钱存放在净人处，当比丘在场的情况下向这样的人放置金钱的行为在此不算作「存放」。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Consenting</em> in either of these cases, says the Commentary, means that one does not refuse either in thought, word, or deed. Refusing in thought means thinking, “This is not proper for me.” Refusing in word means telling the donor that such a gift is not allowable. Refusing in deed means making a gesture to the same effect. If one refuses in any of these ways—e.g., one wants to accept the gold or money, but tells the donor that it is not allowable; or one says nothing, but simply reminds oneself that such gifts are not proper to accept—one avoids the penalty here.</td>
<td>《义注》说，在这两种情况下，<em>同意</em>意味著一个人在思想、言语或行为（身口意）上都没有拒绝。思想（意）上的拒绝意味著想：「这不适合我。」口头（口）拒绝是指告诉布施者这样的布施是不被允许的。行为（身）拒绝意味著做出同样效果的示意动作。如果以任何一种方式拒绝——例如，想接受黄金或金钱，但告诉布施者这是不允许的；或是甚么也没说，只是提醒自己这样的布施不适合接受──这样就可以避免受到惩罚。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question of whether it is best to express one’s refusal outwardly lies beyond the scope of the Vinaya and often depends on the situation. Ideally, one should inform the donor so that he/she will know enough not to present such gifts in the future, but there are cases where the donor is still new to the idea of rules and will simply be offended if the bhikkhu objects to what he/she means as a well-intentioned gesture. This is thus a matter where a bhikkhu should use his discretion.</td>

<tr><td>However, the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “depositing” gold or money for a bhikkhu indicates that the question of who the donor intends the money for <em>does</em> make a difference under this action, because the nature of the donor’s action is defined by what he or she says. If the donor means the money for the bhikkhu and the bhikkhu consents to its being placed nearby, that fulfills the factor here. This covers cases where the donor says, “This is for you,” or “This is for you to give to X.”</td>

Its discussion of the following rule, though, would seem to imply that it should be returned to the original donor.</td>

The Commentary’s discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> indicates that if money for the Community is placed near Bhikkhu X, the Community is said to have consented to it only when all members of the Community unanimously consent to it. If one member refuses consent, he saves all the other members from committing an offense—except for X, who still has his dukkaṭa.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary here also says that a bhikkhu who consents to monetary donations “placed nearby” him for monastery buildings incurs a dukkaṭa as well.

As the Commentary itself says under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>, if the donor does not mention the name of the bhikkhu or the Community as custodians or recipients of the funds, the donations are not to be refused. Rather, they are to be left there and the steward told of what the donor said.</td>
<td>这里的《义注》还说，一位比丘同意将金钱捐赠放在他「附近」来建造寺院建筑，也会犯《突吉罗》。这是指布施者说：「这是供僧团用于建造某物的」，并将钱放在比丘旁边。正如《义注》本身在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0013/#np10">《舍堕》十</a>下所说，如果布施者没有提及作为资金保管人或接受者的比丘或僧团的名称，则布施不得被拒绝。相反，他们应该被留在那儿，告诉净人布施者所说的话。</td>

His duty is to throw the money away without taking note of where it falls. If he does take note, he incurs a dukkaṭa. The Commentary recommends that, “Closing his eyes, he should throw it into a river, over a cliff, or into a jungle thicket without paying attention to where it falls, disinterested as if it were a bodily secretion <em>(gūthaka)</em>.”</td>

<tr><td>There is some controversy over the status of checks under this rule. In legal terms, a check is a notice to a bank to provide funds for the payee. Because banks are corporate individuals and not “places,” a check made out to a bhikkhu is thus equivalent to a notice from a donor to a steward to provide funds on the bhikkhu’s behalf. Because the funds in question do not change ownership until the recipient cashes the check, this strengthens the similarity to funds placed with a steward: The funds still belong to the donor until they are used, and the steward is responsible if they become lost in the meantime. Thus the simple act of receiving a check counts not as an act of receiving money but as an acknowledgement of the notice. In passing the notice to someone else, one is simply informing them of the donor’s arrangement. Only if a bhikkhu cashes a check or gives an order to someone else to do so does he commit an offense under this rule.</td>
<td>对于本戒条下的支票的地位存在一些争议。从法律角度来说，支票是银行向收款人提供资金的通知。因为银行是法人个体而非「场所」，所以开给比丘的支票相当于布施者向净人发出的代替比丘提供资金的通知。由于相关资金在收款人兑现支票之前不会改变所有权，因此这增强了存放与净人的资金的相似性：资金在使用之前仍属于布施者，如果资金在使用过程中丢失，则净人负责。因此，仅接收支票的行为不算是接收金钱的行为，而是对通知的确认。将通知传递给其他人时，只是告知他们布施者的安排。只有当比丘兑现支票或命令其他人这样做时，他才犯下本戒条。</td>

Thus it would cover cases where a bhikkhu sells any kind of item—allowable or unallowable—for money.</td>
<td>金钱兑换主要是指黄金交易商从事的业务和投机买卖类型——兑换货币、用金矿石换黄金饰品，反之亦然、用金矿石换金矿石、或者用金饰品换金饰品——但《经分别》对感知因素的讨论表明，这里的努力因素包括比丘最终得到黄金或金钱作为交换结果的任何交换。因此，它涵盖了比丘为了金钱而出售任何种类的物品——无论是允许的还是不允许的——的情况。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At first glance, this rule would seem redundant with the preceding rule against receiving money and the following rule against engaging in trade, but actually it closes a number of loopholes in those rules. In the preceding rule, a bhikkhu may point out a steward to a person who brings money intended for him; and in the following rule he can, if he words it right, propose a trade or tell a steward to arrange a trade for him. Thus, given just those two rules, it would be possible for a bhikkhu using “proper” procedures to have his steward engage in currency speculation and other money-making activities without committing an offense.</td>
<td>乍看之下，与前面的禁止接受金钱的戒条和后面的禁止从事贸易的戒条，本戒条似乎是多余的，但实际上它弥补了这些戒条中的一些漏洞。在前条戒条中，比丘可以向为他带来金钱的人指出一名净人；在后面的戒条中，如果他表达正确，他可以提出交易或告诉净人为他安排交易。因此，只有这两条戒条，比丘就有可能使用「适当」的程序让他的净人从事货币投机买卖和其他赚钱活动而不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This rule, though, includes no such exceptions for “wording things right <em>(kappiya-vohāra)</em>,” and so closes those loopholes as far as this type of trading is concerned. As a result, a bhikkhu may not express a desire to his steward that he/she sell something belonging to him or take funds dedicated for his use and invest them for monetary return. If the bhikkhu is going abroad, he must leave it up to his steward to figure out that any funds donated for his use may have to be exchanged for foreign currency if they are going to serve any purpose.</td>
<td>不过，本戒条不包括「措辞正确<em>（kappiya-vohāra）</em>」的例外情况，因此就此类交易而言，堵住了这些漏洞。结果，比丘不能向他的净人表达，让他/她出售属于他的东西，或拿专用于他的资金并投资以获取金钱回报的愿望。如果比丘要出国，他必须让他的净人自己弄清楚，供他使用的任何布施资金如果要发挥任何作用，可能必须兑换成外币。</td>

<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, the item offered in exchange must be one’s own if the exchange is to fall under this rule, but the Vibhaṅga’s non-offense clauses make no exemptions for a bhikkhu who engages in monetary exchange using items belonging to anyone else. Thus if a bhikkhu were to arrange a monetary exchange using goods belonging to his family, he would have to forfeit any proceeds from the exchange that they might offer to him.</td>
<td>根据 K/《义注》，如果交换符合本戒条，则提供的交换物品必须是自己的，但《经分别》的不犯条款对于使用属于其他人的物品进行金钱兑换的比丘没有豁免。因此，如果比丘要使用属于他家人的物品进行金钱兑换，他将不得不放弃他们可能提供给他的任何兑换收益。</td>

Buddhaghosa states that this interpretation is based on a passage that is not in the Vibhaṅga but logically should be. The Sub-commentary supports him, explaining that if monetary exchange covers trades in which money forms one side of the trade, it shouldn’t matter which side of the trade it is on.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，金钱交换是指任何涉及金钱的交易——无论是比丘将物品带入交易、带出交易，或两者兼而有之。<em>佛音</em>指出，这种解释所依据的一段话不在《经分别》中，但逻辑上应该是。《复注》支持他，解释说如果金钱交换涵盖金钱构成交易一方的交易，那么金钱属于交易的哪一方并不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This, however, contradicts a number of points in the Vibhaṅga. (1) Its table of the possible actions covered by this rule includes only cases where the outcome of the trade for the bhikkhu is money. As we noted in the Introduction, we have to trust that the Vibhaṅga arrangers knew what was and was not an offense under a certain rule, and that if they had meant the rule to cover more than the alternatives listed in the table they would have included them. (2) In the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of how the forfeiture is to be conducted, it consistently refers to the offender as the “one who purchased money” and to the bhikkhu who throws the forfeited object away as the “money-disposer.” (3) If <em>monetary exchange</em> covers cases where the bhikkhu uses money to buy allowable things, then the discussion of how a bhikkhu could get his steward to use money rightfully placed with the steward to buy such things would have been included under this rule; instead, it is included under the following rule. All of this seems to indicate that the Commentary is on shaky ground when it tries to force its interpretation on the Vibhaṅga here.</td>
<td>然而，这与《经分别》中的许多观点相矛盾。（1）本戒条涵盖的可能行动表格仅包括比丘交易的结果是金钱的情况。正如我们在<strong>引言</strong>中指出的，我们必须相信《经分别》编排者知道在特定戒条下什么是犯戒，什么不是犯戒，并且如果他们想让该戒条涵盖比表格中列出的替代方案更多的内容，他们就会包括他们。（2）《经分别》在讨论如何进行舍出时，始终将犯戒者称为「购买金钱的人」，并将扔掉舍出物品的比丘称为「金钱处置者」。（3）如果<em>金钱兑换</em>涵盖比丘用金钱购买允许的物品的情况，那么比丘如何让他的净人使用正确存放在净人那里的金钱来购买这些物品的讨论就包含在本戒条中；相反，它包含在下一个戒条中。所有这些似乎都表明，当《义注》试图将其解释强加于此处的《经分别》时，它的基础是不稳固的。</td>
