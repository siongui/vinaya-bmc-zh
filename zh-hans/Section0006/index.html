<tr><td>Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.</td>
<td>Dhamma-Vinaya（法与律）是佛陀对自己所创立的宗教的名字。法（Dhamma）——真理——是他发现并指出的，作为对所有想要从痛苦中解脱的人的建议。律（Vinaya）是他为追随者制定的规则、理想和行为标准。这些追随者离开家庭生活，更加认真地寻求解脱。虽然本书主要讨论戒律，但我们首先应该注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法与律的共同作用。从理论上讲，它们可能是分开的，但对于实践它们的人来说，它们作为心灵和性格中发展的品质而融合在一起。</td>

「戒律是为了克制，克制是为了无悔，无悔是为了欢悦，欢悦是为了喜，喜是为了轻安，轻安是为了乐，乐是为了定，定是为了如实知见，如实知见是为了厌离，厌离是为了离欲，离欲是为了解脱，解脱是为了解脱知见，解脱知见是为了无取著般涅槃。」——<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/reference/external-link/#pv-xii-2">《附随》.十二.2</a></div>

此可追溯《中阿含经》卷10〈习相应品〉第五，有16部经都有如下类似的说明：「阿难！因持戒便得不悔。因不悔便得欢悦。 因欢悦便得喜。因喜便得止。因止便得乐。因乐便得定。阿难！多闻圣弟子因定，便得见如实、知如真。因见如实、知如真，便得厌。因厌便得无欲。因无欲便得解脱。因解脱便知解脱︰生已尽，梵行已立，所作已办，不更受有，知如真。阿难﹗是为法法相益，法法相因。如是此戒趣至第一，谓度此岸，得至彼岸」。
此次第可以简化如下︰持戒→无悔→欢悦→心喜→身安（轻安）→乐→心定→如实知见→厌→离欲→解脱→知解脱（自谓︰我证解脱。复起如是智见︰我生已尽、梵行已立、所作已办，不受后有）。

<tr><td>In establishing his religion of release, though, the Buddha did not simply set out a body of recommendations and rules. He also founded a company (<em>parisā</em>) of followers. This company falls into four main groups: bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunīs (nuns), lay men, and lay women. Although the Buddha saw no need to organize the laity in any manner, he arranged for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs—who had given up the entanglements of the household life to devote themselves more fully to the goal of release—to develop into communities. And he saw that they needed, as all communities do, ideals and standards, rules and customs to ensure their stability. This need is what gave rise to the Vinaya.</td>
<td>然而，在建立他的解脱宗教时，佛陀并没有仅只提出一系列建议和规则。他还创立了追随众（ <em>parisā</em> ）。该众分为四个主要群体：比丘、比丘尼、优婆塞（男在家）和优婆夷（女在家）。虽然佛陀认为没有必要以任何方式组织在家众，但他安排比丘和比丘尼——他们已经放弃了家庭生活的纠缠，更充分地致力于解脱的目标——发展成团体。他认为，正如所有团体一样，他们需要理想和标准、规则和习俗来确保稳定。这种需要就是戒律的产生。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the early years of the Buddha’s career, the texts tell us, there was no need to formulate monastic disciplinary rules. All of the bhikkhus in his following—the Community of bhikkhunīs had not yet been started—were men of high personal attainments who had succeeded in subduing many or all of their mental defilements. They knew his teachings well and behaved accordingly. The Canon tells of how Ven. Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, asked the Buddha at an early date to formulate a Pāṭimokkha, or code of rules, to ensure that the celibate life the Buddha had founded would last long, just as a thread holding together a floral arrangement ensures that the flowers are not scattered by the wind. The Buddha replied that the time for such a code had not yet come, for even the most backward of the men in the Community at that time had already had their first glimpse of the goal. Only when mental effluents (<em>āsava</em>) made themselves felt in the Community would there be a need for a Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>文献告诉我们，在佛陀生涯的早期，没有必要制戒。他追随者中的所有比丘——比丘尼僧团尚未成立——都是具有很高个人成就的人，他们已经成功地降伏了许多或全部的心理烦恼。他们非常了解他的教导，并按照他的教导行事。《圣典》讲述了舍利弗尊者是佛陀的上首弟子之一，他很早就请求佛陀制定《波罗提木叉》戒律，以确保佛陀所创立的梵行生活能够久住，就像用一根线将插花连接在一起一样，花不会被风吹散。佛陀回答说，制戒的时候还没有到来，因为即使是当时僧团中最落后的人也已经得法眼净。只有当漏（ <em>āsava</em> ）在僧团中出现时，才会需要《波罗提木叉》。</td>

<p>Ven. Bhaddāli: “Why is it, venerable sir, that there used to be fewer training rules and more bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening? And why is it that there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening?” [Bhaddāli, who has been unwilling to abide by the training rules, seems to be suggesting that the rise in the number of training rules is itself the cause for fewer bhikkhus’ attaining Awakening. The Buddha, however, offers a different explanation.]</p>
<p>The Buddha: “So it is, Bhaddāli. When beings have begun to degenerate and the true Dhamma has begun to disappear, there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening. The Teacher does not lay down a training rule for his disciples as long as there are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community. But when there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community, then the Teacher lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.</p>
<p>“There are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community as long as the Community has not become large. But when the Community has become large, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.... When the Community possesses great material gains... great status... a large body of learning… When the Community is long-standing, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.”</p>

<p>〔世尊曰：〕「跋陀利！其实如次：即于诸有情衰落、正法灭没时，学处较多而悟入住立之比丘较少。跋陀利！在此少许漏住法不现于僧团之期间内，师对诸弟子不予制定学处。跋陀利！若有少许漏住法出现僧团中时，此时师为防卫彼等诸漏住法，而为诸弟子制定学处。</p>

<tr><td>Thus the rules themselves were not the cause for degeneracy in the Community, and the conditions that provided a foothold for the effluents were not themselves effluents. Rather, the growing complexity of the Community provided the opportunity for bhikkhus to act on the basis of their defilements in a growing variety of ways, and the rules—although they could not prevent any of the five conditions—had to become correspondingly complex to counteract the opportunities those conditions provided for unenlightened behavior.</td>
<td>因此，戒律本身并不是僧团堕落的原因，为漏提供立足点的因缘本身也不是漏。相反，僧团的日益复杂性为比丘们提供了机会，以越来越多的方式根据他们的烦恼采取行动，而戒律——尽管它们不能阻止五种因缘中的任何一种——必须变得相对应地复杂以抵销这些因缘为无明的行为提供的机会。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Even when these conditions did arise, though, the Buddha did not set out a full code at once. Instead, he formulated rules one at a time in response to events. The considerations that went into formulating each rule are best illustrated by the events surrounding the formulation of the first.</td>
<td>然而，即使这些因缘确实出现，佛陀也没有立即制定完整的戒律。相反，他针对事件一次一个地制戒。制定每个戒条时所考虑的因素可以透过围绕第一个戒条制定时的事件得到最好的说明。</td>
