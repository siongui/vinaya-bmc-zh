<tr><td>Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.</td>
<td>Dhamma-Vinaya（法与律）是佛陀对自己所创立的宗教的名字。法（Dhamma）——真理——是他发现并指出的，作为对所有想要从痛苦中解脱的人的建议。律（Vinaya）是他为追随者制定的规则、理想和行为标准。这些追随者离开家庭生活，更加认真地寻求解脱。虽然本书主要讨论戒律，但我们首先应该注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法与律的共同作用。从理论上讲，它们可能是分开的，但对于实践它们的人来说，它们作为心灵和性格中发展的品质而融合在一起。</td>

此可追溯《中阿含经》卷10〈习相应品〉第五，有16部经都有如下类似的说明：「阿难！因持戒便得不悔。因不悔便得欢悦。 因欢悦便得喜。因喜便得止。因止便得乐。因乐便得定。阿难！多闻圣弟子因定，便得见如实、知如真。因见如实、知如真，便得厌。因厌便得无欲。因无欲便得解脱。因解脱便知解脱︰生已尽，梵行已立，所作已办，不更受有，知如真。阿难﹗是为法法相益，法法相因。如是此戒趣至第一，谓度此岸，得至彼岸」。
此次第可以简化如下︰持戒→无悔→欢悦→心喜→身安（轻安）→乐→心定→如实知见→厌→离欲→解脱→知解脱（自谓︰我证解脱。复起如是智见︰我生已尽、梵行已立、所作已办，不受后有）。

<tr><td>In establishing his religion of release, though, the Buddha did not simply set out a body of recommendations and rules. He also founded a company (<em>parisā</em>) of followers. This company falls into four main groups: bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunīs (nuns), lay men, and lay women. Although the Buddha saw no need to organize the laity in any manner, he arranged for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs—who had given up the entanglements of the household life to devote themselves more fully to the goal of release—to develop into communities. And he saw that they needed, as all communities do, ideals and standards, rules and customs to ensure their stability. This need is what gave rise to the Vinaya.</td>
<td>然而，在建立他的解脱宗教时，佛陀并没有仅只提出一系列建议和规则。他还创立了追随众（ <em>parisā</em> ）。该众分为四个主要群体：比丘、比丘尼、优婆塞（男在家）和优婆夷（女在家）。虽然佛陀认为没有必要以任何方式组织在家众，但他安排比丘和比丘尼——他们已经放弃了家庭生活的纠缠，更充分地致力于解脱的目标——发展成团体。他认为，正如所有团体一样，他们需要理想和标准、规则和习俗来确保稳定。这种需要就是戒律的产生。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the early years of the Buddha’s career, the texts tell us, there was no need to formulate monastic disciplinary rules. All of the bhikkhus in his following—the Community of bhikkhunīs had not yet been started—were men of high personal attainments who had succeeded in subduing many or all of their mental defilements. They knew his teachings well and behaved accordingly. The Canon tells of how Ven. Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, asked the Buddha at an early date to formulate a Pāṭimokkha, or code of rules, to ensure that the celibate life the Buddha had founded would last long, just as a thread holding together a floral arrangement ensures that the flowers are not scattered by the wind. The Buddha replied that the time for such a code had not yet come, for even the most backward of the men in the Community at that time had already had their first glimpse of the goal. Only when mental effluents (<em>āsava</em>) made themselves felt in the Community would there be a need for a Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>文献告诉我们，在佛陀生涯的早期，没有必要制戒。他追随者中的所有比丘——比丘尼僧团尚未成立——都是具有很高个人成就的人，他们已经成功地降伏了许多或全部的心理烦恼。他们非常了解他的教导，并按照他的教导行事。《圣典》讲述了舍利弗尊者是佛陀的上首弟子之一，他很早就请求佛陀制定《波罗提木叉》戒律，以确保佛陀所创立的梵行生活能够久住，就像用一根线将插花连接在一起一样，花不会被风吹散。佛陀回答说，制戒的时候还没有到来，因为即使是当时僧团中最落后的人也已经得法眼净。只有当漏（ <em>āsava</em> ）在僧团中出现时，才会需要《波罗提木叉》。</td>

<p>Ven. Bhaddāli: “Why is it, venerable sir, that there used to be fewer training rules and more bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening? And why is it that there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening?” [Bhaddāli, who has been unwilling to abide by the training rules, seems to be suggesting that the rise in the number of training rules is itself the cause for fewer bhikkhus’ attaining Awakening. The Buddha, however, offers a different explanation.]</p>
<p>The Buddha: “So it is, Bhaddāli. When beings have begun to degenerate and the true Dhamma has begun to disappear, there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening. The Teacher does not lay down a training rule for his disciples as long as there are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community. But when there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community, then the Teacher lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.</p>
<p>“There are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community as long as the Community has not become large. But when the Community has become large, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.... When the Community possesses great material gains... great status... a large body of learning… When the Community is long-standing, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.”</p>

<tr><td>Thus the rules themselves were not the cause for degeneracy in the Community, and the conditions that provided a foothold for the effluents were not themselves effluents. Rather, the growing complexity of the Community provided the opportunity for bhikkhus to act on the basis of their defilements in a growing variety of ways, and the rules—although they could not prevent any of the five conditions—had to become correspondingly complex to counteract the opportunities those conditions provided for unenlightened behavior.</td>
<td>因此，戒律本身并不是僧团堕落的原因，为漏提供立足点的因缘本身也不是漏。相反，僧团的日益复杂性为比丘们提供了机会，以越来越多的方式根据他们的烦恼采取行动，而戒律——尽管它们不能阻止五种因缘中的任何一种——必须变得相对应地复杂以抵销这些因缘为无明的行为提供的机会。</td>

His parents, fearing that the government would confiscate their property at their death if it had no heir, devised various schemes to lure Ven. Sudinna back to the lay life, but to no avail. Finally, his mother realized that he was firm in his intention to stay a bhikkhu and so asked him at least to have intercourse with his former wife so that their property would have an heir. Ven. Sudinna consented, took his wife into the forest, and had intercourse three times.</td>

<tr><td>Immediately he felt remorse and eventually confessed his deed to his fellow bhikkhus. Word reached the Buddha, who called a meeting of the Community, questioned Ven. Sudinna, and gave him a rebuke. The rebuke fell into two major parts. In the first part, the Buddha reminded Ven. Sudinna of his position as a <em>samaṇa</em> —a monk or contemplative—and that his behavior was unworthy of his position. Also, the Buddha pointed out to him the aims of the teaching and noted that his behavior ran counter to them. The implication here was that Ven. Sudinna had not only acted inconsistently with the content of the teaching, but had also shown callous disregard for the Buddha’s compassionate aims in making the Dhamma known.</td>
<td>他立刻感到后悔，并最终向同侪比丘坦白了自己的行为。消息传到了佛陀那里，佛陀召开了一次僧团会议，询问了须提那尊者，并诃责了他。诃责分为两个主要部分。第一部分，佛陀提醒须提那尊者，指出他作为 <em>samaṇa</em> （沙门）的地位，以及他的行为与他的地位不相称。此外，佛陀向他指出了教法的目的，并指出他的行为与这些目的背道而驰。这里的意思是须提那尊者的行为不仅与佛法的内容不符，而且还冷酷无情地漠视佛陀弘扬佛法的慈悲目的。</td>

<tr><td>These reasons fall into three main types. The first two are external: 1) to ensure peace and well being within the Community itself, and 2) to foster and protect faith among the laity, on whom the bhikkhus depend for their support. (The origin stories of the various rules depict the laity as being very quick to generalize. One bhikkhu misbehaves, and they complain, “How can these Sakyan-son monks do that?”) The third type of reason, though, is internal: The rule is to help restrain and prevent mental effluents within the individual bhikkhus. Thus the rules aim not only at the external well being of the Community but also at the internal well being of the individual. This latter point soon becomes apparent to anyone who seriously tries to keep to the rules, for they foster mindfulness and circumspection in one’s actions, qualities that carry over into the training of the mind.</td>

<tr><td>After his total nibbāna, though, his followers made a concerted effort to establish a standard canon of Dhamma and Vinaya, and the Pali Canon as we know it began to take shape. The Vinaya was organized into two main parts: 1) the Sutta Vibhaṅga, the ‘Exposition of the Text’ (which from here on we will refer to simply as the Vibhaṅga), containing almost all the material dealing with the Pāṭimokkha rules; and 2) the Khandhakas, or Groupings, which contain the remaining material organized loosely according to subject matter. The Khandhakas themselves are divided into two parts, the Mahāvagga, or Greater Chapter, and the Cullavagga, or Lesser Chapter. Historians estimate that the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas reached their present form in approximately the 2nd century B.C.E., and that the Parivāra, or Addenda—a summary and study guide—was added a few centuries later, closing the Vinaya Piṭaka, the part of the Canon dealing with discipline.</td>
<td>然而，在他无余涅槃之后，他的追随者齐心协力建立了标准的法和律经典，而我们所知的巴利圣典开始成形。戒律分为两个主要部分：1）Sutta Vibhaṅga《经分别》，即「文本的解释」（从这里开始，我们将简称为 Vibhaṅga），包含几乎所有涉及《波罗提木叉》戒条的材料； 2) Khandhaka《犍度》或称篇章，其中包含根据主题松散组织的剩余材料。《犍度》本身分为两部分：Mahāvagga（大品）和 Cullavagga（小品）。历史学家估计，《经分别》和《犍度》在大约公元前2世纪达到了现在的形式，而 Parivāra 或称《附随》——一份总结和学习指南——在几个世纪后被添加，完成了《律藏》（Vinaya Piṭaka），即圣典有关戒律的部份。</td>

<tr><td>Because the purpose of this volume is to translate and explain the Pāṭimokkha, we are most directly concerned with the Vibhaṅga. It is organized as follows: The rules in the Pāṭimokkha are presented one by one, each rule preceded by an origin story relating the events leading up to its formulation. In some instances a rule went through one or more reformulations, in which case an additional story is provided for each amendment to show what prompted it. With each new formulation of a rule, any previous formulations were automatically rescinded. Otherwise, the added restrictions or allowances contained in the reformulations would have been rendered meaningless. Thus, the final formulation of the rule is the authoritative one, with the earlier formulations holding only historical interest.</td>
<td>因为本册的目的是翻译和解释《波罗提木叉》，所以我们最直接关心的是《经分别》。它的组织如下：《波罗提木叉》中的戒条一个接一个介绍，每条戒条之前都有一个起源故事，讲述了导致其制定的事件。在某些情况下，一条戒条经历了一次或多次重新制定，在这种情况下，为每一项修正提供了一个额外的故事，以显示促使其发生的原因。随著戒条的每一个新的制定，任何先前的制定都将自动废除。否则，重新制定中所包含的附加限制或开缘将变得毫无意义。因此，该戒条的最终表述具有权威性，而早期的表述仅具有历史意义。</td>
