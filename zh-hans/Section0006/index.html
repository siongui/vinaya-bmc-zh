<tr><td>Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.</td>
<td>Dhamma-Vinaya（法与律）是佛陀对自己所创立的宗教的名字。法（Dhamma）——真理——是他发现并指出的，作为对所有想要从痛苦中解脱的人的建议。律（Vinaya）是他为追随者制定的规则、理想和行为标准。这些追随者离开家庭生活，更加认真地寻求解脱。虽然本书主要讨论戒律，但我们首先应该注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法与律的共同作用。从理论上讲，它们可能是分开的，但对于实践它们的人来说，它们作为心灵和性格中发展的品质而融合在一起。</td>

此可追溯《中阿含经》卷10〈习相应品〉第五，有16部经都有如下类似的说明：「阿难！因持戒便得不悔。因不悔便得欢悦。 因欢悦便得喜。因喜便得止。因止便得乐。因乐便得定。阿难！多闻圣弟子因定，便得见如实、知如真。因见如实、知如真，便得厌。因厌便得无欲。因无欲便得解脱。因解脱便知解脱︰生已尽，梵行已立，所作已办，不更受有，知如真。阿难﹗是为法法相益，法法相因。如是此戒趣至第一，谓度此岸，得至彼岸」。
此次第可以简化如下︰持戒→无悔→欢悦→心喜→身安（轻安）→乐→心定→如实知见→厌→离欲→解脱→知解脱（自谓︰我证解脱。复起如是智见︰我生已尽、梵行已立、所作已办，不受后有）。

<tr><td>In establishing his religion of release, though, the Buddha did not simply set out a body of recommendations and rules. He also founded a company (<em>parisā</em>) of followers. This company falls into four main groups: bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunīs (nuns), lay men, and lay women. Although the Buddha saw no need to organize the laity in any manner, he arranged for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs—who had given up the entanglements of the household life to devote themselves more fully to the goal of release—to develop into communities. And he saw that they needed, as all communities do, ideals and standards, rules and customs to ensure their stability. This need is what gave rise to the Vinaya.</td>
<td>然而，在建立他的解脱宗教时，佛陀并没有仅只提出一系列建议和规则。他还创立了追随众（ <em>parisā</em> ）。该众分为四个主要群体：比丘、比丘尼、优婆塞（男在家）和优婆夷（女在家）。虽然佛陀认为没有必要以任何方式组织在家众，但他安排比丘和比丘尼——他们已经放弃了家庭生活的纠缠，更充分地致力于解脱的目标——发展成团体。他认为，正如所有团体一样，他们需要理想和标准、规则和习俗来确保稳定。这种需要就是戒律的产生。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the early years of the Buddha’s career, the texts tell us, there was no need to formulate monastic disciplinary rules. All of the bhikkhus in his following—the Community of bhikkhunīs had not yet been started—were men of high personal attainments who had succeeded in subduing many or all of their mental defilements. They knew his teachings well and behaved accordingly. The Canon tells of how Ven. Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, asked the Buddha at an early date to formulate a Pāṭimokkha, or code of rules, to ensure that the celibate life the Buddha had founded would last long, just as a thread holding together a floral arrangement ensures that the flowers are not scattered by the wind. The Buddha replied that the time for such a code had not yet come, for even the most backward of the men in the Community at that time had already had their first glimpse of the goal. Only when mental effluents (<em>āsava</em>) made themselves felt in the Community would there be a need for a Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>文献告诉我们，在佛陀生涯的早期，没有必要制戒。他追随者中的所有比丘——比丘尼僧团尚未成立——都是具有很高个人成就的人，他们已经成功地降伏了许多或全部的心理烦恼。他们非常了解他的教导，并按照他的教导行事。《圣典》讲述了舍利弗尊者是佛陀的上首弟子之一，他很早就请求佛陀制定《波罗提木叉》戒律，以确保佛陀所创立的梵行生活能够久住，就像用一根线将插花连接在一起一样，花不会被风吹散。佛陀回答说，制戒的时候还没有到来，因为即使是当时僧团中最落后的人也已经得法眼净。只有当漏（ <em>āsava</em> ）在僧团中出现时，才会需要《波罗提木叉》。</td>

<p>Ven. Bhaddāli: “Why is it, venerable sir, that there used to be fewer training rules and more bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening? And why is it that there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening?” [Bhaddāli, who has been unwilling to abide by the training rules, seems to be suggesting that the rise in the number of training rules is itself the cause for fewer bhikkhus’ attaining Awakening. The Buddha, however, offers a different explanation.]</p>
<p>The Buddha: “So it is, Bhaddāli. When beings have begun to degenerate and the true Dhamma has begun to disappear, there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening. The Teacher does not lay down a training rule for his disciples as long as there are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community. But when there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community, then the Teacher lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.</p>
<p>“There are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community as long as the Community has not become large. But when the Community has become large, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.... When the Community possesses great material gains... great status... a large body of learning… When the Community is long-standing, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.”</p>

<tr><td>Thus the rules themselves were not the cause for degeneracy in the Community, and the conditions that provided a foothold for the effluents were not themselves effluents. Rather, the growing complexity of the Community provided the opportunity for bhikkhus to act on the basis of their defilements in a growing variety of ways, and the rules—although they could not prevent any of the five conditions—had to become correspondingly complex to counteract the opportunities those conditions provided for unenlightened behavior.</td>
<td>因此，戒律本身并不是僧团堕落的原因，为漏提供立足点的因缘本身也不是漏。相反，僧团的日益复杂性为比丘们提供了机会，以越来越多的方式根据他们的烦恼采取行动，而戒律——尽管它们不能阻止五种因缘中的任何一种——必须变得相对应地复杂以抵销这些因缘为无明的行为提供的机会。</td>

His parents, fearing that the government would confiscate their property at their death if it had no heir, devised various schemes to lure Ven. Sudinna back to the lay life, but to no avail. Finally, his mother realized that he was firm in his intention to stay a bhikkhu and so asked him at least to have intercourse with his former wife so that their property would have an heir. Ven. Sudinna consented, took his wife into the forest, and had intercourse three times.</td>

<tr><td>Immediately he felt remorse and eventually confessed his deed to his fellow bhikkhus. Word reached the Buddha, who called a meeting of the Community, questioned Ven. Sudinna, and gave him a rebuke. The rebuke fell into two major parts. In the first part, the Buddha reminded Ven. Sudinna of his position as a <em>samaṇa</em> —a monk or contemplative—and that his behavior was unworthy of his position. Also, the Buddha pointed out to him the aims of the teaching and noted that his behavior ran counter to them. The implication here was that Ven. Sudinna had not only acted inconsistently with the content of the teaching, but had also shown callous disregard for the Buddha’s compassionate aims in making the Dhamma known.</td>
<td>他立刻感到后悔，并最终向同侪比丘坦白了自己的行为。消息传到了佛陀那里，佛陀召开了一次僧团会议，询问了须提那尊者，并诃责了他。诃责分为两个主要部分。第一部分，佛陀提醒须提那尊者，指出他作为 <em>samaṇa</em> （沙门）的地位，以及他的行为与他的地位不相称。此外，佛陀向他指出了教法的目的，并指出他的行为与这些目的背道而驰。这里的意思是须提那尊者的行为不仅与佛法的内容不符，而且还冷酷无情地漠视佛陀弘扬佛法的慈悲目的。</td>

<tr><td>These reasons fall into three main types. The first two are external: 1) to ensure peace and well being within the Community itself, and 2) to foster and protect faith among the laity, on whom the bhikkhus depend for their support. (The origin stories of the various rules depict the laity as being very quick to generalize. One bhikkhu misbehaves, and they complain, “How can these Sakyan-son monks do that?”) The third type of reason, though, is internal: The rule is to help restrain and prevent mental effluents within the individual bhikkhus. Thus the rules aim not only at the external well being of the Community but also at the internal well being of the individual. This latter point soon becomes apparent to anyone who seriously tries to keep to the rules, for they foster mindfulness and circumspection in one’s actions, qualities that carry over into the training of the mind.</td>

<tr><td>After his total nibbāna, though, his followers made a concerted effort to establish a standard canon of Dhamma and Vinaya, and the Pali Canon as we know it began to take shape. The Vinaya was organized into two main parts: 1) the Sutta Vibhaṅga, the ‘Exposition of the Text’ (which from here on we will refer to simply as the Vibhaṅga), containing almost all the material dealing with the Pāṭimokkha rules; and 2) the Khandhakas, or Groupings, which contain the remaining material organized loosely according to subject matter. The Khandhakas themselves are divided into two parts, the Mahāvagga, or Greater Chapter, and the Cullavagga, or Lesser Chapter. Historians estimate that the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas reached their present form in approximately the 2nd century B.C.E., and that the Parivāra, or Addenda—a summary and study guide—was added a few centuries later, closing the Vinaya Piṭaka, the part of the Canon dealing with discipline.</td>
<td>然而，在他无余涅槃之后，他的追随者齐心协力建立了标准的法和律经典，而我们所知的《巴利圣典》开始成形。戒律分为两个主要部分：1）Sutta Vibhaṅga《经分别》，即「文本的解释」（从这里开始，我们将简称为 Vibhaṅga），包含几乎所有涉及《波罗提木叉》戒条的材料； 2) Khandhaka《犍度》或称篇章，其中包含根据主题松散组织的剩余材料。《犍度》本身分为两部分：Mahāvagga（大品）和 Cullavagga（小品）。历史学家估计，《经分别》和《犍度》在大约公元前2世纪达到了现在的形式，而 Parivāra 或称《附随》——一份总结和学习指南——在几个世纪后被添加，完成了《律藏》（Vinaya Piṭaka），即《圣典》有关戒律的部份。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because the purpose of this volume is to translate and explain the Pāṭimokkha, we are most directly concerned with the Vibhaṅga. It is organized as follows: The rules in the Pāṭimokkha are presented one by one, each rule preceded by an origin story relating the events leading up to its formulation. In some instances a rule went through one or more reformulations, in which case an additional story is provided for each amendment to show what prompted it. With each new formulation of a rule, any previous formulations were automatically rescinded. Otherwise, the added restrictions or allowances contained in the reformulations would have been rendered meaningless. Thus, the final formulation of the rule is the authoritative one, with the earlier formulations holding only historical interest.</td>
<td>因为本册的目的是翻译和解释《波罗提木叉》，所以我们最直接关心的是《经分别》。它的组织如下：《波罗提木叉》中的戒条一个接一个介绍，每条戒条之前都有一个起源故事，讲述了导致其制定的事件。在某些情况下，一条戒条经历了一次或多次重新制定，在这种情况下，为每一项修正提供了一个额外的故事，以显示促使其发生的原因。随著戒条的每一个新的制定，任何先前的制定都将自动废除。否则，重新制定中所包含的附加限制或开缘将变得毫无意义。因此，该戒条的最终表述具有权威性，而早期的表述仅具有历史意义。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>After the final statement of the rule is a word-analysis (<em>pada-bhājaniya</em>), which explains in detail most of the important terms in the rule. For many of the rules this analysis includes one or more “wheels,” or tables, giving the contingencies connected with the rule, working out all their possible permutations and passing judgment as to what penalty, if any, each permutation entails. For example, the discussion of the first rule contains a wheel that gives all the objects with which a person might have sexual intercourse, lists them against the variables of the sort of intercourse and whether or not the bhikkhu involved gives his consent, and announces the penalty for each possible combination of factors.</td>
<td>戒条的最后陈述之后是语句解说 (<em>pada-bhājaniya</em>)，它详细解释了戒条中的大多数重要术语。对于许多戒条，这种解说包括一个或多个「轮子」，或称表格，给出与戒条相关的意外情况，计算出所有可能的排列，并判断每种排列所带来的惩罚（如果有的话）。例如，第一条戒条的讨论包含一个轮子，给出一个人可能发生性交的所有物体，根据性交类型以及所涉及的比丘是否同意的变数列出它们，并宣布对每种可能的因素组合的惩罚。<!-- （报告书） 上座部仏教僧侣の吃烟に関する研究 ―戒律文献の ...

The originals for these ancient commentaries may have been brought to Sri Lanka from India and translated into Sinhalese, but frequent references throughout the commentaries to places and people in Sri Lanka show that much of the material in the commentaries was composed in Sri Lanka. From internal evidence in Buddhaghosa’s writings—he compiled commentaries on a major portion of the Canon—historians have estimated that the ancient commentaries were collected over a span of several centuries and closed in approximately the 4th century C.E.

At a few points, such as his explanation of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc9">Pc 9</a>, he provides arguments effectively demolishing the ancient commentaries’ interpretation but then backs off, saying that the ancient commentaries must be right because their authors knew the Buddha’s intentions. Perhaps pressure from the elder bhikkhus at the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura—the place where the ancient commentaries had been preserved and where Buddhaghosa was allowed to do his work—was what made him back off in this way. At any rate, only on points where the different ancient commentaries were silent or gave divergent opinions did he feel free to express his own.</td>

Although this book was officially supplanted by the <em>Vinaya-mukha</em> (see below), many Communities in Thailand, especially among the Kammaṭṭhāna forest tradition, still prefer it as more authoritative. The book contains a minimum of explanatory material, but it does occasionally provide interpretations of the Canon that cannot be traced directly to the Commentary.

<tr><td>There are two levels of difficulty in trying to collate all these various texts. The first is that the Canon and Commentary, in Pali, exist in four major printed editions: Thai, Burmese, Sri Lankan, and European (printed by the Pali Text Society (PTS)). Although these editions are largely in agreement, they occasionally differ in ways that can have an important practical impact. Thus, where the editions differ, I have had to choose the reading that seems most reasonable and consistent with the rest of the Canon. In some cases, this has meant adopting a reading followed in only one edition against a reading followed in all the others (see, for example, the discussions under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg3">Sg 3</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg4">4</a>). Where different readings seem equally reasonable, I have given the alternative readings as well.</td>

Only if a statement stands up under comparison with what is known of the Canon should it be accepted as true Dhamma or Vinaya. This standard was enunciated when the texts were still orally transmitted, but applied to our situation at present it means that we cannot take the assumed reliability of a particular printed edition as definitive. If a certain reading seems more consistent than its alternatives with what is known of the rest of the Canon, then—regardless of the edition in which it is found—it should be preferred.

<tr><td>This passage implies that already in the time of the Buddha the bhikkhus had begun working out a way to interpret the rules that in some cases was not exactly in line with the way the Buddha had originally formulated them. Some people have read this passage as suggesting that the Buddha, though resigned to this development, was displeased with it. This, however, would contradict the many passages in the Canon where the Buddha speaks in high praise of Ven. Upāli, the foremost of his bhikkhu disciples in terms of his knowledge of Vinaya, who was responsible for teaching the rules to the other bhikkhus and who was largely responsible for the shape of the Vinaya as we now have it. It seems more likely that the Buddha in this passage is simply saying that, to avoid unnecessary controversy, the way the bhikkhus had worked out the implications of the rules was to be accepted as is.</td>
<td>这段经文暗示，早在佛陀时代，比丘们就已经开始想办法来解释这些戒条，在某些情况下，这些戒条并不完全符合佛陀最初制定的方式。有些人读到这段话时认为，佛陀虽然听任了这种发展，但却对此不满意。然而，这与《圣典》中佛陀高度赞扬<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%84%AA%E5%A9%86%E9%9B%A2">优婆离尊者</a>的许多段落相矛盾。优婆离尊者是比丘弟子中，就戒律知识而言是第一的，负责向其他比丘教导戒律，并且对我们现在所拥有的戒律的形成负有主要责任。佛陀在这段经文中似乎更可能只是说，为了避免不必要的争议，比丘们弄清楚戒条意思的方式应该照原样接受。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because this development eventually led to the Vibhaṅga, we can be fairly confident that in adhering to the Vibhaṅga we are acting as the Buddha would have us do. And when we check the few places where the Vibhaṅga deviates from the wording of the rules, we find that almost invariably it has tried to reconcile contradictions among the rules themselves, and between the rules and the Khandhakas, so as to make the Vinaya a more coherent whole. This is particularly true with rules that touch on Community transactions. Apparently, many of these rules were formulated before the general patterns for transactions were finalized in the Khandhakas. Thus, after the patterns were established, the compilers of the Vibhaṅga were sometimes forced to deviate from the wording of the original rules to bring them into line with the patterns.</td>
<td>因为这种发展最终导致了《经分别》，所以我们可以相当有信心地相信，在遵从《经分别》时，我们正在按照佛陀的要求行事。当我们检视《经分别》中与戒条措词有偏差的少数地方时，我们发现它几乎无一例外地试图调和戒条本身、以及戒条与《犍度》之间的矛盾，从而使戒律成为一个更连贯的整体。对于涉及僧伽羯磨的戒条尤其如此。显然，在《犍度》里，羯磨的一般模式最终确定之前，其中许多戒条已制定。因此，在模式确立后，《经分别》的编纂者有时被迫偏离原始戒条的措词，以使其与模式保持一致。</td>

<tr><td>As for contradictions between the Commentary and the Vibhaṅga, this is a more controversial area, with two extremes of thought. One is to reject the Commentary entirely, as it is not the Buddha’s word, for modern historical scholarship has shown decisively that it contains material dating many hundreds of years after the Buddha’s passing away. The other extreme is to accept the Commentary as superseding the Vibhaṅga entirely, in line with the traditional belief that grew up around it: that it was composed at the First Council to express the true intent of those who composed the Vibhaṅga and yet somehow were unable to put what they really meant to say into the Canon itself. Although exponents of each extreme can cite traditional sources in their defense, neither extreme complies with the two sets of Great Standards—the one mentioned above, the other below—that the Buddha formulated for judging what is and is not allowable under the Vinaya, and what does and does not count as Dhamma-Vinaya in the first place.</td>
<td>至于《义注》与《经分别》的矛盾，这是一个比较有争议的领域，有两个极端的想法。一是完全拒绝《义注》，因为它不是佛陀的教言，因为现代历史学术已经明确地表明，它所包含的材料可以追溯到佛陀入灭后数百年。另一个极端是接受《义注》完全取代《经分别》，这与围绕它产生的传统信仰是一致的：它是在第一次结集时撰写的，旨在表达那些撰写《经分别》的人的真实意图，但不知何故无法做到把他们真正想说的话放进《圣典》本身。虽然每个极端的倡导者都可以引用传统资料来为自己辩护，但两个极端都不符合《四大教示》中的两项教示——上文已提到一项，下文将提到另一项——《四大教示》是佛陀起初为判断戒律所允许的和不允许的，以及符不符合法与律而制定的</td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>From this statement, it is possible to argue that the Commentary has no legislative authority at all. One of its most controversial aspects—and this applies to the Sub-commentary as well—is a tendency not only to explain passages in the Canon but also to extrapolate from them, assigning prohibitions and allowances in areas that the Canon did not cover. This would appear to be in violation of the above statement. However, we must remember that the rules formulated by the Buddha include not only prohibitions but also allowances. As the Dhamma-Vinaya has spread to many nations, encountering new cultures, and has endured over time, encountering new technologies, the question has often arisen: Is everything not allowed prohibited? Is everything not prohibited allowed? Either position carried to its extreme would create huge problems in the practice. To say that everything not allowed is prohibited would prevent bhikkhus from utilizing many harmless conveniences; to say that everything not prohibited is allowed would give countless defilements free rein.</td>
<td>从这个说法来看，可以说《义注》根本没有制戒权。它最具争议性的方面之一（这也适用于《复注》）是倾向于不仅解释《圣典》中的段落，而且还从中进行推断，在《圣典》未涵盖的领域中指定禁止和许可。这似乎违反了上述声明。然而，我们必须记住，佛陀制定的戒条不仅包括禁止，还包括允许。随著法与律传播到许多国家，遇到新的文化，并随著时间的推移，遇到新科技，经常出现这样的问题：是不是一切不允许的事情都被禁止了？一切不被禁止的事情都是允许的吗？任何一种走向极端的立场都会在实践中产生巨大的问题。如果说一切不被允许的事情都是被禁止的，就会阻止比丘们利用许多无害的方便；如果说一切不被禁止的事情都是允许的，就会让无数的烦恼肆意妄为。</td>

<tr><td>The third passage, a discussion in the Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, further elaborates this point by listing four levels of Vinaya, in descending order of authority: the level found in the Canon, the level based on the four Great Standards given in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.40.1">Mv.VI.40.1</a>, the level found in the Commentary, and the level based on one’s personal opinion. Any disagreement among these sources, this passage notes, should be settled by siding with the opinion of the higher authority. Thus the Commentary to the Vinaya puts itself only on the third level of authority, adding that not all of the Commentary qualifies even for that level. The opinions of Vinaya experts after the first generation of commentators, even though included in the Commentary, count only as personal opinion. At present there is no way of knowing for sure which opinions are first-generation and which are not, although the opinions of Sri Lankan Vinaya experts named in the Commentary would obviously fall in the latter category.</td>
<td>第三个段落是针对<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">《波罗夷》一</a>的《义注》中的讨论，进一步阐述了这一点，按照权威性由高到低，列出了戒律的四个阶层：《圣典》中找到的层级，基于<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0328a05">《大品》.六.40.1</a>给出的《四大教示》的层级，《义注》中找到的层级，以及基于个人意见的层级。这段话指出，这些来源之间的任何分歧都应该以更高权威的意见为准。因此，戒律的《义注》仅将自己置于第三级权威，并补充说，并不是所有的《义注》都符合这一级别。第一代论师之后的戒律专家的意见，即使包含在《义注》中，也仅算作个人意见。目前无法确定哪些观点是第一代，哪些不是，尽管《义注》中点名的斯里兰卡戒律专家的观点显然属于后一类。<!-- TODO FIXME: replace link to 《波罗夷》一 -->

<tr><td>It’s not that I take any joy in arguing with the Commentary. In fact, wherever possible, I have been happy to give it the benefit of the doubt, and on many points I am very much in its debt. Still, now that Buddhism is coming to the West, I feel it is time to stop and take stock of the commentarial tradition and to check it against the earliest sources. This is especially important in a way of thought and life that, from the very beginning, has appealed to reason and investigation rather than to blindly accepted authority. In doing this, I am simply following a pattern that has repeated itself through the history of the Theravādin tradition: that of returning to the original principles whenever the religion reaches an historic turning point.</td>
<td>我并不是以与《义注》争论为乐。事实上，只要有可能，我都乐意姑且先相信它，并且在很多方面我都非常感激它。尽管如此，既然佛教正在传入西方，我觉得是时候停下来全面盘点注释传统，并根据最早的来源进行检查。这对于从一开始就诉诸理性和调查而不是盲目接受权威的思想和生活方式来说尤其重要。 在这样做时，我只是遵循了上座部传统历史中不断重复的模式：每当宗教达到历史转折点时，就回到最初的原则。<!-- https://www.google.com/search?q=the%20benefit%20of%20the%20doubt%20%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87
