<tr><td><strong>Four: The Food Chapter</strong></td>
<td><strong>第四 食物品</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: <em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em> (consumables) and <em>khādaniya</em> (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term <em>staple</em> here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.</td>
<td>本章中的许多戒条将食物分为两类：<em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em>（噉食）和<em>khādaniya</em>（嚼食）。学者通常将两者翻译为「较软的食物」和「较硬的食物」，尽管特定食物的软硬程度与其所属类别关系不大。更贴近每个类别本质的翻译是「主食」和「副食」。两者之间的差异至关重要，因为它往往是决定什么是犯戒，什么不是犯戒的因素。但请注意，此处的「<em>主食</em>」一词仅涵盖佛陀时代被认为是主食的食物。面包、义大利面和马铃薯在西方是主食，但在当时的印度并非一直都是主食，因此并不总是属于这一类别。</td>

<em>1) Cooked grains:</em> The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc35">Pc 35</a> defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are <em>sāḷi</em> (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); <em>vīhi</em> (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); <em>yava</em> (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); <em>godhūma</em> (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); <em>kaṅgu</em> (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); <em>varaka</em> (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and <em>kudrūsaka</em> (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.</div>

<em>2) Kummāsa:</em> The Commentary describes this as a staple confection made out of <em>yava</em> but doesn’t give any further details aside from saying that if the <em>kummāsa</em> is made out of any of the other grains or mung beans, it doesn’t count as a staple food. References to <em>kummāsa</em> in the Canon show that it was a very common staple that could form a rudimentary meal in and of itself and would spoil if left overnight.</div>

To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkaṭa. Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive (“People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting’”) or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion’s flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there, instead of criticizing or complaining, attacked them).</td>
<td>《大品》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9-15</a>）禁食十种肉：人肉、象肉、马肉、狗肉、蛇肉、狮肉、虎肉、豹肉、熊肉和鬣狗肉。食用人肉犯《偷兰遮》；食用任何其他不被允许食用的肉则犯《突吉罗》。人肉、马肉和象肉被认为过于尊贵，不宜食用。其他肉类被禁止食用，要么是因为它们令人讨厌（「人们批评、抱怨并四处传播：『这些沙门释迦子怎么能吃狗肉？狗令人厌恶，令人作呕』」），要么是因为它们危险（比丘们，闻起来有狮子肉的味道，进入丛林；那里的狮子没有批评或抱怨，而攻击了他们）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds three comments here: (a) These prohibitions cover not only the meat of these animals but also their blood, bones, skin, and hide (the layer of tissue just under the skin—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_113.html">AN 4:113</a>). (b) The prohibition against dog flesh does not include wild dogs, such as wolves and foxes, (but many teachers—including the Thai translator of the Commentary—question this point). The flesh of a half-dog half-wolf mixture, however, would be forbidden. (c) The prohibition against snake flesh covers the flesh of all long, footless beings. Thus eels would not be allowed. (Many Communities question this last point as well.)</td>
<td>《义注》在此补充了三点评论： (a) 这些禁令不仅涵盖这些动物的肉，还涵盖它们的血、骨、皮和兽皮（皮下组织层－参见<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/04.html#%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%89%E9%A6%AC%E5%88%BA">《增支部》4:113经</a>）。 (b) 禁止食用狗肉的规定并不包括狼和狐狸等野狗（但许多导师——包括《义注》的泰文译者——对此表示质疑）。然而，半狗半狼混血的肉是被禁止的。 (c) 禁止食用蛇肉的规定涵盖所有长而无足的生物的肉。因此，鳗鱼是不允许的。（许多僧团也对最后一点表示质疑。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.23.9">Mv.VI.23.9</a> also states that if a bhikkhu is uncertain as to the identity of any meat presented to him, he incurs a dukkaṭa if he doesn’t ask the donor what it is before eating it. The Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, on reflection, one recognizes what kind of meat it is, one needn’t ask the donor about the identity of the meat. If one doesn’t recognize it, one <em>must</em> ask. If one mistakenly identifies an unallowable sort of meat as allowable and then goes ahead and consumes it under that mistaken assumption, there is no offense.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9</a> 也规定，如果比丘不确定提供给自己的肉是什么，并且在食用前没有询问施主，犯《突吉罗》。《义注》对此的解释是，如果经过深思熟虑后，认出了是什么肉，就无需询问施主是什么肉。如果认不出，就<em>必须</em>询问。如果比丘错误地将不允许的肉认定为可允许的肉，并基于这种错误的认知继续食用，则不构成犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>Raw flesh and blood are allowed at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.10.2">Mv.VI.10.2</a> only when one is possessed by non-human beings. Thus, in more ordinary circumstances, one may not eat raw fish or meat even if of an allowable kind. This would include such things as steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, raw eggs, and caviar. Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.31.14">Mv.VI.31.14</a>).</td>

Any of these items ordinarily used as medicines, though, would not be classed as a non-staple food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc37">《波逸提》三七</a>的《义注》将以下物品列为副食：面粉和面粉制成的甜点（不含鸡蛋的蛋糕、面包和义大利面也归入此类）；此外，根、块茎（包括马铃薯）、莲藕、芽、茎、树皮、叶子、花、果实、坚果、种子粉、种子以及制成食物的树脂。然而，任何这些通常用作药物之物均不属于副食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also acknowledges that some societies use roots, tubers, confections made out of flour, etc., as staple foods, but it nowhere suggests that the definition of staple food be altered to fit the society in which one is living. However—because eggs come under meat—any bread, pastries, noodles, and pasta made with eggs are staple foods. Thus in the West we are left with a somewhat zigzag line separating what are and are not staple foods for the purposes of the rules: Meal pounded from grain is a staple; flour ground from grain is not. Bread made with oat meal, corn meal, wheat germ, etc., would thus be a staple; bread made without any grain meal or eggs would not. The same holds true for pastries, noodles, and pasta.</td>
<td>《义注》也承认有些社会使用根茎类植物、面粉制成的甜点等作为主食，但并未暗示应根据个人所处的社会环境改变主食的定义。然而，由于鸡蛋属于肉类，任何用鸡蛋制成的面包、糕点、面条和义大利面都属于主食。因此，在西方，就戒条而言，主食和副食的划分存在一条略显曲折的界线：谷物捣碎的粗粮是主食；谷物磨成的面粉则不是。因此，用燕麦粉、玉米粉、小麦胚芽等制成的面包是主食；不含谷物粉或鸡蛋的面包则不是主食。糕点、面条和义大利面也是如此。</td>

<tr><td>In discussing the Great Standards, the Commentary says that grain is a “great fruit,” and thus the juice of any one of nine large fruits—palmyra fruit, coconut, jackfruit, breadfruit, bottle gourd, white gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, and squash—would fall under the same class as the juice of grain: i.e., as a non-staple food and not a juice drink. From this judgment, many Communities infer that the juice of <em>any</em> large fruit, such as pineapple or grapefruit, would also be classed as a non-staple food. However, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point, as the allowance for juice-drinks states specifically that the juice of all fruits is allowed except for that of grain.</td>
<td>在讨论《四大教示》时，《义注》指出谷物是一种「大水果」，因此九种大型水果——棕榈果、椰子、菠萝蜜、面包果、葫芦、冬瓜、甜瓜、西瓜和南瓜——的任何一种果汁都与谷物汁液属于同一类别：即归类为副食而非果汁饮料。基于这个判断，许多僧团推论，<em>任何</em>大型水果的果汁，例如凤梨或柚子，也应归类为副食。然而，并非所有僧团都认同《义注》的这一观点，因为果汁饮料的开缘明确规定，除谷物汁液外，所有水果的果汁均允许。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, allowable leaf-juice drinks include juice squeezed from leaves that are considered food—such as lettuce, spinach, or beet greens—as well as from leaves that are classed as medicines. Health drinks such as wheat grass juice would thus be allowable. Leaf-juice may be mixed with cold water and/or warmed in the sunlight. The prohibition against consuming the juice from cooked vegetables in the afternoon covers all cooked leaves that are considered food, as well as any medicinal leaves cooked in liquids that are classed as food, such as milk. Medicinal leaves cooked in pure water retain their classification as lifetime medicines.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，允许的叶汁饮料包括从被视为食物的叶子（例如生菜、菠菜或甜菜叶）以及被归类为药物的叶子榨出的汁。因此，例如小麦草汁等健康饮品是允许的。叶汁可以用冷水混合和/或在阳光下加热。禁止在下午饮用煮熟的蔬菜汁的规定涵盖所有被视为食物的煮熟叶子，以及任何在被归类为食物的液体（例如牛奶）中煮熟的药用叶子。用纯水煮熟的药用叶子仍保留其终身药物的分类。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s discussion of flower juice drinks allowable and unallowable for the afternoon shows that licorice flower juice was used to make alcohol, which is why the Canon doesn’t include it as allowable in this class. The Commentary extends this prohibition to cover any kind of flower juice prepared in such a way that it will become alcoholic. The Commentary goes on to say, though, that licorice flower juice and other flower juices <em>not</em> prepared so that they will become toddy are allowable in the morning.</td>
<td>《义注》讨论了下午允许和不允许的花汁饮料，显示甘草花汁曾被用来酿酒，因此《圣典》并未将其列入允许的此类饮品。《义注》将这项禁令扩展至涵盖任何经过调制后会变成酒精的花汁。不过，《义注》继续指出，甘草花汁和其他<em>未</em>经调制成棕榈酒的花汁在早上是允许的。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes further that if a bhikkhu himself makes any of the juice drinks, he may consume it only before noon. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered before noon, one may “also” drink it with food before noon—the “also” here implying that the original allowance, that one may drink it without food after noon and before dawnrise, still holds. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered after noon, one may drink it without food until the following dawnrise. The allowance for mango juice drink covers juice made either from ripe or from unripe mangoes. To make unripe mango juice, it recommends that the mango be cut or broken into small pieces, placed in water, heated in sunlight, and then strained, adding honey, sugar, and/or camphor as desired. Juice made from <em>Bassia pierrei</em> must be diluted with water, as the undiluted juice of this fruit is too thick.</td>
<td>《义注》进一步指出，如果比丘自己做任何果汁饮料，他只能在中午前饮用。如果果汁是由非比丘制作并在中午之前正式地供养，则比丘「也」可以在中午之前与食物一起饮用——这里的「也」意味著原来的开缘仍然有效，即可以在中午之后和黎明之前不带食物地饮用。如果果汁是由非比丘制作并在中午之后正式地供养，则比丘可以在第二天黎明之前不带食物地饮用。芒果汁饮料的允许范围涵盖成熟或未成熟芒果制成的果汁。要制作未成熟芒果汁，建议将芒果切成或掰成小块，放入水中，在阳光下加热，然后过滤，并根据需要添加蜂蜜、糖和/或樟脑。用<em>芒果椴树（Bassia pierrei）</em>制成的果汁必须用水稀释，因为这种水果的未稀释果汁太浓稠。</td>

Thus, it says, if fruit juice has a whole, unhusked coconut floating in it, the coconut may be removed, and the juice is all right to drink until the following dawnrise. If butter is placed on top of rice porridge, the part of the butter that hasn’t melted into the rice may be kept and eaten for seven days.

<td>由混合不同有效期限的食物成份制成的可食用物 —— 例如咸牛肉、蜂蜜止咳糖浆、加糖柳橙汁 —— 具有与有效期最短的食物成份相同的有效期。因此，咸牛肉被视为牛肉，蜂蜜止咳糖浆被视为蜂蜜，加糖柳橙汁被视为柳橙汁（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a>）。根据《义注》，这里的<em>混合</em>意味著彻底混合。因此，它说，如果果汁中漂浮著一个完整的未去壳的椰子，则可以将椰子取出，果汁可以喝到第二天黎明。如果将奶油放在米粥上，那么没有融入米饭的部分的奶油可以保存和食用七天。如果同时存在具有不同有效期的物品，只要它们不相互渗透，它们就会保持各自的有效期。然而，并非所有僧团都在这一点上遵循《义注》。</td>

<tr><td>Translated in this way, the passage covers foods that are already mixed when presented to a bhikkhu. One of the general issues that led to the convening of the Second Council, however, concerned how to treat cases where foods received separately are then mixed by a bhikkhu. The specific issue presented to the Council was that of bhikkhus who kept a horn filled with salt so that they could add salt to bland foods. The Council’s verdict was that in doing so, the bhikkhus incurred a pācittiya under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>. The Vibhaṅga to that rule, however, gives a dukkaṭa for using, as food, life-long medicine that has been stored overnight, and salt is a life-long medicine. Thus the elders at the Council seem to have reasoned that if the salt has been mixed in with food, the mixture as a whole counts as food accepted when the first ingredient (the salt) was accepted: thus the pācittiya, rather than the dukkaṭa, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>.

<tr><td>The question the Commentary then raises is, “Why is the word ‘that day’ <em>(tadahu)</em> omitted from the last case?” Its answer is that there is no limit on when the medicine has to be received for it to be properly mixed with a tonic received today. In other words, it could have been received any number of days before the tonic was received. If it is mixed with the tonic on the first day of the tonic’s life span, the mixture as a whole has a seven-day life span. If mixed with the tonic on the second day of the tonic’s life, the mixture has a six-day life span, and so forth. The Commentary’s translation of this passage may strain standard Pali syntax, but it is grammatically correct and is the only way of deriving from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.40.3">Mv.VI.40.3</a> a general principle to cover the issue of foods received separately that are then mixed by a bhikkhu. Thus the principle has been generally accepted that tonics and medicines, such as sugar and salt, received today may be eaten mixed with food or juice drinks received today, but not with food or juice drinks received on a later day. Medicine, such as salt, tea, or cocoa, received at any time may be eaten mixed with any of the five tonics on any day of the tonic’s life span.</td>
<td>《义注》接下来提出的问题是：「为什么在最后一种情况下省略了『当天』<em>（tadahu）</em>这个词？」答案是，没有限制何时接受药物以便将其与今天接受的补品适当地混合。换句话说，它可以是在接受补品之前的任何天接受的。如果它在补品的有效期的第一天与补品混合，则混合物作为一个整体拥有七天的有效期。如果在补品有效期的第二天与补品混合，则混合物拥有六天的有效期，依此类推。《义注》对这段话的翻译可能不符合标准巴利句法，但在语法上是正确的，并且是从<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_006#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a> 中得出涵盖比丘分开接受然后混合食物问题的一般原则的唯一方法。因此，普遍接受的原则是：今天接受的补品和药物（例如糖和盐）可以与今天收到的食物或果汁饮料混合食用，但不能与之后的日期里接受的食物或果汁饮料混合食用。任何时间接受的药物（例如盐、茶或可可）都可以与五种补品中的任何一种在补品有效期内的任何一天混合食用。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s conclusion, though, creates a problem when lay people want to invite Communities of more than three bhikkhus to their homes for a meal. Perhaps this problem is what induced the Commentary to interpret the Vibhaṅga’s definition of a <em>group meal</em> as meaning one in which the invitations specifically mention the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em>, or the type of meal or food to be served. (“Come to my house for breakfast tomorrow.” “I know you don’t often get a chance to eat Indian food, so I’m inviting you all over for chappatties and curry.”) This interpretation has led to the custom of phrasing invitations to eat “in the morning” or to eat “before noon,” so that groups of four or more bhikkhus may be invited without breaking this rule.</td>
<td>然而，《义注》的结论却带来了一个问题：当在家众想邀请超过三位比丘的僧团到家中用餐时，就会出现问题。或许正是这个问题促使《义注》将《经分别》对「<em>结众食</em>」的定义解读为，邀请中明确提到「<em>餐</em>」或「<em>食物</em>」一词，或具体提供餐食或食物种类。（「明天来我家吃早餐。」「我知道你们不常有机会吃印度菜，所以我邀请你们全部来吃印度薄饼和咖哩。」）这种解读导致了邀请措辞中出现「早上」吃或「中午之前」吃的习惯，这样，邀请四位或四位以上的比丘团体也不会违反这条戒条。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Buddha’s purposes for establishing this rule, though, are listed at Cv.VII.3.13 as follows: “For the restraint of evil-minded individuals, for the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, so that those with evil desires will not split the Community by (forming) a faction, and out of compassion for families.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of <em>group meal</em> accomplishes none of these purposes: The custom of phrasing invitations to avoid the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em> does nothing to restrain evil-minded individuals, etc., and it actually creates trouble for lay people who do not know the custom, a point well-illustrated by the Commentary itself in an entertaining section on how to deal with a person whose invitation contains the word <em>meal</em>. After getting the run-around from the meal designator—who apparently was not allowed to tell him in any straightforward way how to phrase his invitation and so gave him a long series of hints—the poor man returns to his friends and makes a cryptic statement that the A/Sub-commentary translates as: “There are a lot of words that have to be spoken in this business of making an invitation.

</tr>
<tr><td>To find an alternative to the Commentary’s explanation, we have to go back to the origin stories leading to the reformulations of the rule, where we find an interesting point: The invitations rejected by scrupulous bhikkhus on the grounds that they would break the rule all deal with “invitational” meals. In one of them, a naked ascetic invites a group of bhikkhus to an invitational meal and is rejected on the grounds that it would constitute a group meal. He then goes to the Buddha and—after complaining that he should not be subjected to such treatment—rephrases the invitation, this time inviting the entire Community. This suggests that he felt an invitation of this sort would not constitute a group meal.</td>
<td>为了找到与《义注》不同的解释，我们必须追溯导致戒条被重新制定的起源故事，在那里我们发现了一个有趣的点：那些被严谨的比丘们以违反戒戒为由拒绝的邀请，都与「邀请」食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「别请食」]</span>有关。其中一则故事中，一位裸体苦行僧<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「裸形外道」]</span>邀请一群比丘参加邀请食，却被拒绝，理由是这会构成结众食。他随后来到佛陀面前，在抱怨自己不应遭受这种待遇之后，重新措辞了邀请，这次邀请的是整个僧团。这表明，他认为这种邀请不构成结众食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>His reasoning has its grounds in the Vinaya itself: Throughout the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas, the word <em>group</em> is used to refer to any set of bhikkhus not forming a complete Community and yet acting as an independent unit. This may be why the category of Community meal was not mentioned in the non-offense clauses: The arrangers of the Vibhaṅga may have felt that no mention was necessary, in that the term <em>group</em> meal automatically excluded Community meals.</td>
<td>他的推论在戒律中自有其依据：在《经分别》和《犍度》中，「<em>结众</em>」一词被用来指任何未组成完整僧团，但仍作为独立单位行动的比丘群体。这或许就是为什么在不犯条款中没有提及僧团食这个类别的原因：《经分别》的编纂者可能认为没有必要提及，因为「<em>结众</em>」一词自动排除了僧团食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Similar considerations suggest that designated meals may also be exempted from this rule even though they are not mentioned in the non-offense clauses. Invitations to such meals were customarily worded as requests for so-and-so many bhikkhus “from the Community,” and thus—as a type of Community meal—they would by definition not be invitations to a “group” meal.</td>
<td>类似的考虑表明，即使不犯条款中未提及指定食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「僧次请食」]</span>，也可不受此戒条约束。此类餐食的邀请习惯措词为「来自僧团」的某某多少比丘的请求，因此，作为一种僧团食，它们从定义上来说并非「结众」食的邀请。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because invitations to lottery meals and periodic meals did not customarily make reference to the Community, the Vibhaṅga arrangers did have to make mention of those types of meals in order to exempt them.</td>
<td>由于抽签食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「行筹食」]</span>和周期食的邀请通常不会提及僧团，因此《经分别》的编纂者必须提及这些类型的餐食才能免除它们。</td>

<td><em>我们剩下的戒条只适用于对四名或四名以上比丘的特定群体（而非僧团）的邀请，无论邀请中是否提到「食物」或「餐」一词。</em></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form has the virtue of fulfilling the express purposes mentioned for it in Cv.VII.3.13: It would prevent evil-minded bhikkhus and lay people from trying to exert influence over specific groups in the Community by arranging meals especially for them; and in the same way, it would prevent people with evil desires from creating a split in the Community. (Because the smallest faction that can create a split in the Community is four bhikkhus, the maximum number allowed at a group meal is three.)</td>
<td>这种形式的戒条，其优点在于能够实现<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N04n0002_017#0268a04">《小品》.七.3.13</a> 中明确提及的目的：它可以防止心怀恶欲的比丘和在家众，试图透过专门为僧团中的特定群体安排餐食来对他们施加影响；同样，它也可以防止心怀恶欲的人在僧团中制造分裂。（由于能够造成僧团分裂的最小派系是四位比丘，因此结众食允许的最大人数是三人。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form would also contribute to the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus in that invitations to meals would not be preempted by factions; and it would protect lay families from being prey to the maneuverings of bhikkhus who would pressure them repeatedly into providing meals as part of their strategy to create and maintain such factions. (Anyone who has lived in a traditional Buddhist country knows only too well the influence of sweet-talking bhikkhus over unsuspecting or low-minded lay people. This sort of thing neither started nor ended with Devadatta.)</td>
<td>这种形式的戒条也能让品行端正的比丘们感到乐住，因为用餐邀请不会被派系抢先；它还能保护在家人免受比丘们的计谋的侵害。比丘们会反复施压，要求他们提供餐食，以此作为制造和维持派系的策略之一。（任何在传统佛教国家生活过的人都深知甜言蜜语的比丘们对毫无戒心或心境低下的在家人的影响。提婆达多既不是这种事的开端，也不是终结。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because Community meals and designated meals would not form an opening for such machinations, there would be no reason to limit them to groups of three if lay people want to invite groups larger than that. One objection to exempting Community meals from this rule is that a meal for the entire Community would be more burdensome than a meal for a smaller group, but that is what designated meals are for. A donor willing and able to provide a meal for an entire Community is welcome but not required to do so. A donor willing but not able may simply ask to provide a meal for x-number of bhikkhus from the Community, leaving it up to the meal designator to designate which bhikkhus will go for the meal, with no danger of creating a faction.</td>
<td>因为僧团食和指定食不会为此类阴谋提供机会，所以如果在家众想邀请比三人更多的团体，没有理由将其限制在三人以内。有人反对将僧团食排除在这条戒条之外，因为为整个僧团提供一餐比为一小群人提供一餐更有负担，但指定食就是为了满足这一需求。愿意且有能力为整个僧团供餐的布施者欢迎但不强制要求这样做。愿意但无力提供的布施者可以直接要求为僧团中的x位比丘供餐，由餐食指定者指定哪些比丘来享用这餐，这样就不会有分裂的危险。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Thus the point at issue is not whether the invitation makes mention of food or meals, but whether it specifies the individual bhikkhus to be invited.</em> If it specifies more than three individual bhikkhus—either naming them outright or saying such things as “Ven. X and four of his friends,” or “The five of you,” etc.—the meal would count as a group meal.</td>
<td><em>因此，问题的关键不在于邀请中是否提及食物或餐，而在于是否指定受邀的比丘。</em>如果邀请指定三位以上的比丘——无论是直接点名，还是诸如「X尊者和他的四位朋友」或「你们五位」之类的说法——那么这餐就算是结众食。</td>

<em>A meal supplied by monks</em> is one provided by a person who has taken on the state of religious wanderer. This the Commentary explains as meaning not only those ordained in other religions, but also one’s own co-religionists (bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, and novices) as well; the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “one who has taken on the state of religious wanderer” under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc41">Pc 41</a> suggests that the Commentary is correct. This exemption, as its origin story makes clear, was formulated to promote good relations between bhikkhus and members of other religions, but it also means that a bhikkhu, from his own resources, can provide food for a group of his friends without incurring an offense. Although this exemption could thus open the door for wealthy bhikkhus to attract factions, as long as they are not getting their funds from lay donors, they would be placing no burden on the laity, which seems to be the most important of the purposes for this rule.</div>

<em>沙门提供的餐食</em>是指处于宗教流浪者状态的人所提供餐食。《义注》解释说，这不仅指在其他宗教中出家的人，也指自己的同教信徒（比丘、比丘尼和沙弥）；<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc41">《波逸提》四一</a>中《经分别》对「处于宗教流浪者状态的人」的定义表明，《义注》是正确的。这项豁免，正如其起源故事所清楚表明的那样，是为了促进比丘与其他宗教信徒之间的良好关系而制定的，但它也意味著比丘可以用自己的资源为一群朋友提供食物而不会犯戒。虽然这项豁免可能会为富有的比丘吸引派系打开方便之门，但只要他们的资金不来自在家施主，他们就不会给在家众带来负担，这似乎是这条戒条最重要的目的。</div>
