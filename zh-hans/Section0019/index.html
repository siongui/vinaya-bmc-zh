</tr>
<tr><td>Many of the rules in this chapter classify food into two groups: <em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em> (consumables) and <em>khādaniya</em> (chewables). Scholars usually translate the two as “softer food” and “harder food,” although the hardness or softness of a particular food has little to do with the category it belongs to. A translation closer to the essence of each category would be “staple food” and “non-staple food.” The distinction between the two is important, for it is often the deciding factor between what is and is not an offense. Note, however, that the term <em>staple</em> here covers only what was considered staple in the time of the Buddha. Bread, pasta, and potatoes, which are staples in the West, were not always staples in India at that time and so do not always fit into this category.</td>
<td>本章中的许多戒条将食物分为两类：<em>bhojana/bhojaniya</em>（噉食）和<em>khādaniya</em>（嚼食）。学者通常将两者翻译为「较软的食物」和「较硬的食物」，尽管特定食物的软硬程度与其所属类别关系不大。更贴近每个类别本质的翻译是「主食」和「副食」。两者之间的差异至关重要，因为它往往是决定什么是犯戒，什么不是犯戒的因素。但请注意，此处的「<em>主食</em>」一词仅涵盖佛陀时代被认为是主食的食物。面包、义大利面和马铃薯在西方是主食，但在当时的印度并非一直都是主食，因此并不总是属于这一类别。</td>

<em>1) Cooked grains:</em> The Commentary to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc35">Pc 35</a> defines this as seven types of cooked grain, but there is disagreement on the identity of some of the seven. They are <em>sāḷi</em> (BD translates this as rice; the Thais, wheat); <em>vīhi</em> (BD again has rice, and the Thais agree); <em>yava</em> (BD has barley; the Thais, glutinous rice); <em>godhūma</em> (BD has wheat; the Thais, tares); <em>kaṅgu</em> (both BD and the Thais identify this as millet or sorghum); <em>varaka</em> (BD doesn’t identify this beyond saying that it is a bean; the Thais are probably right in identifying it as Job’s tears); and <em>kudrūsaka</em> (the Commentary defines this term as covering all forms of grain coming from grass—rye would be an example in the West). Whatever the precise definitions of these terms, though, we could argue from the Great Standards that any grain cooked as a staple—including corn (maize) and oats—would fit into this category.</div>

References to <em>kummāsa</em> in the Canon show that it was a very common staple that could form a rudimentary meal in and of itself and would spoil if left overnight.</div>

To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkaṭa. Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive (“People criticized and complained and spread it about, ‘How can these Sakyan-son monks eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting’”) or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion’s flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there, instead of criticizing or complaining, attacked them).</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds three comments here: (a) These prohibitions cover not only the meat of these animals but also their blood, bones, skin, and hide (the layer of tissue just under the skin—see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_113.html">AN 4:113</a>). (b) The prohibition against dog flesh does not include wild dogs, such as wolves and foxes, (but many teachers—including the Thai translator of the Commentary—question this point). The flesh of a half-dog half-wolf mixture, however, would be forbidden. (c) The prohibition against snake flesh covers the flesh of all long, footless beings. Thus eels would not be allowed. (Many Communities question this last point as well.)</td>
<td>《义注》在此补充了三点评论： (a) 这些禁令不仅涵盖这些动物的肉，还涵盖它们的血、骨、皮和兽皮（皮下组织层－参见<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/04.html#%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%89%E9%A6%AC%E5%88%BA">《增支部》4:113经</a>）。 (b) 禁止食用狗肉的规定并不包括狼和狐狸等野狗（但许多导师——包括《义注》的泰文译者——对此表示质疑）。然而，半狗半狼混血的肉是被禁止的。 (c) 禁止食用蛇肉的规定涵盖所有长而无足的生物的肉。因此，鳗鱼是不允许的。（许多僧团也对最后一点表示质疑。）</td>

<tr><td><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.23.9">Mv.VI.23.9</a> also states that if a bhikkhu is uncertain as to the identity of any meat presented to him, he incurs a dukkaṭa if he doesn’t ask the donor what it is before eating it. The Commentary interprets this as meaning that if, on reflection, one recognizes what kind of meat it is, one needn’t ask the donor about the identity of the meat. If one doesn’t recognize it, one <em>must</em> ask. If one mistakenly identifies an unallowable sort of meat as allowable and then goes ahead and consumes it under that mistaken assumption, there is no offense.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_006/#0289a14">《大品》.六.23.9</a> 也规定，如果比丘不确定提供给自己的肉是什么，并且在食用前没有询问施主，犯《突吉罗》。《义注》对此的解释是，如果经过深思熟虑后，认出了是什么肉，就无需询问施主是什么肉。如果认不出，就<em>必须</em>询问。如果比丘错误地将不允许的肉认定为可允许的肉，并基于这种错误的认知继续食用，则不构成犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>Raw flesh and blood are allowed at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0044.html#Mv.VI.10.2">Mv.VI.10.2</a> only when one is possessed by non-human beings. Thus, in more ordinary circumstances, one may not eat raw fish or meat even if of an allowable kind. This would include such things as steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, raw eggs, and caviar. Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.31.14">Mv.VI.31.14</a>).</td>

Any of these items ordinarily used as medicines, though, would not be classed as a non-staple food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="#Pc37">《波逸提》三七</a>的《义注》将以下物品列为副食：面粉和面粉制成的甜点（不含鸡蛋的蛋糕、面包和义大利面也归入此类）；此外，根、块茎（包括马铃薯）、莲藕、芽、茎、树皮、叶子、花、果实、坚果、种子粉、种子以及制成食物的树脂。然而，任何这些通常用作药物之物均不属于副食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also acknowledges that some societies use roots, tubers, confections made out of flour, etc., as staple foods, but it nowhere suggests that the definition of staple food be altered to fit the society in which one is living. However—because eggs come under meat—any bread, pastries, noodles, and pasta made with eggs are staple foods. Thus in the West we are left with a somewhat zigzag line separating what are and are not staple foods for the purposes of the rules: Meal pounded from grain is a staple; flour ground from grain is not. Bread made with oat meal, corn meal, wheat germ, etc., would thus be a staple; bread made without any grain meal or eggs would not. The same holds true for pastries, noodles, and pasta.</td>
<td>《义注》也承认有些社会使用根茎类植物、面粉制成的甜点等作为主食，但并未暗示应根据个人所处的社会环境改变主食的定义。然而，由于鸡蛋属于肉类，任何用鸡蛋制成的面包、糕点、面条和义大利面都属于主食。因此，在西方，就戒条而言，主食和副食的划分存在一条略显曲折的界线：谷物捣碎的粗粮是主食；谷物磨成的面粉则不是。因此，用燕麦粉、玉米粉、小麦胚芽等制成的面包是主食；不含谷物粉或鸡蛋的面包则不是主食。糕点、面条和义大利面也是如此。</td>

<tr><td>According to the Commentary, the juice must be strained and may be warmed by sunlight but not heated over a fire. What category boiled juice would fit under, the Commentary does not say. As we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP23">NP 23</a>, the Vinaya-mukha—arguing from the parallel between sugar cane juice, which is a juice drink, and sugar, which is made by boiling sugar cane juice—maintains that boiled juice would fit under sugar in the five tonics. This opinion, however, is not accepted in all Communities. In those that do accept it, pasteurized juice, juice concentrates, and juice made from concentrate would come under sugar.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，果汁必须过滤，可以用阳光加热，但不能用火加热。《义注》没有说明煮过的果汁应归入哪一类。正如我们在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0015/#NP23">《舍堕》二三</a>中指出的，《戒律入口》——以甘蔗汁（一种果汁饮料）和糖（由煮沸甘蔗汁制成）之间的相似性为论辩——认为煮过的果汁应归入五种补品中的糖。然而，并非所有僧团都接受这种观点。在接受这种观点的僧团中，巴氏杀菌果汁、果汁浓缩液和从浓缩液制成的果汁都被归类在糖。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the Great Standards, the Commentary says that grain is a “great fruit,” and thus the juice of any one of nine large fruits—palmyra fruit, coconut, jackfruit, breadfruit, bottle gourd, white gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, and squash—would fall under the same class as the juice of grain: i.e., as a non-staple food and not a juice drink. From this judgment, many Communities infer that the juice of <em>any</em> large fruit, such as pineapple or grapefruit, would also be classed as a non-staple food. However, not all Communities follow the Commentary on this point, as the allowance for juice-drinks states specifically that the juice of all fruits is allowed except for that of grain.</td>
<td>在讨论《四大教示》时，《义注》指出谷物是一种「大水果」，因此九种大型水果——棕榈果、椰子、菠萝蜜、面包果、葫芦、冬瓜、甜瓜、西瓜和南瓜——的任何一种果汁都与谷物汁液属于同一类别：即归类为副食而非果汁饮料。基于这个判断，许多僧团推论，<em>任何</em>大型水果的果汁，例如凤梨或柚子，也应归类为副食。然而，并非所有僧团都认同《义注》的这一观点，因为果汁饮料的开缘明确规定，除谷物汁液外，所有水果的果汁均允许。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>According to the Commentary, allowable leaf-juice drinks include juice squeezed from leaves that are considered food—such as lettuce, spinach, or beet greens—as well as from leaves that are classed as medicines. Health drinks such as wheat grass juice would thus be allowable. Leaf-juice may be mixed with cold water and/or warmed in the sunlight. The prohibition against consuming the juice from cooked vegetables in the afternoon covers all cooked leaves that are considered food, as well as any medicinal leaves cooked in liquids that are classed as food, such as milk. Medicinal leaves cooked in pure water retain their classification as lifetime medicines.</td>
<td>根据《义注》，允许的叶汁饮料包括从被视为食物的叶子（例如生菜、菠菜或甜菜叶）以及被归类为药物的叶子榨出的汁。因此，例如小麦草汁等健康饮品是允许的。叶汁可以用冷水混合和/或在阳光下加热。禁止在下午饮用煮熟的蔬菜汁的规定涵盖所有被视为食物的煮熟叶子，以及任何在被归类为食物的液体（例如牛奶）中煮熟的药用叶子。用纯水煮熟的药用叶子仍保留其终身药物的分类。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s discussion of flower juice drinks allowable and unallowable for the afternoon shows that licorice flower juice was used to make alcohol, which is why the Canon doesn’t include it as allowable in this class. The Commentary extends this prohibition to cover any kind of flower juice prepared in such a way that it will become alcoholic. The Commentary goes on to say, though, that licorice flower juice and other flower juices <em>not</em> prepared so that they will become toddy are allowable in the morning.</td>
<td>《义注》讨论了下午允许和不允许的花汁饮料，显示甘草花汁曾被用来酿酒，因此《圣典》并未将其列入允许的此类饮品。《义注》将这项禁令扩展至涵盖任何经过调制后会变成酒精的花汁。不过，《义注》继续指出，甘草花汁和其他<em>未</em>经调制成棕榈酒的花汁在早上是允许的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary notes further that if a bhikkhu himself makes any of the juice drinks, he may consume it only before noon. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered before noon, one may “also” drink it with food before noon—the “also” here implying that the original allowance, that one may drink it without food after noon and before dawnrise, still holds. If the juice is made by a non-bhikkhu and formally offered after noon, one may drink it without food until the following dawnrise. The allowance for mango juice drink covers juice made either from ripe or from unripe mangoes. To make unripe mango juice, it recommends that the mango be cut or broken into small pieces, placed in water, heated in sunlight, and then strained, adding honey, sugar, and/or camphor as desired. Juice made from <em>Bassia pierrei</em> must be diluted with water, as the undiluted juice of this fruit is too thick.</td>
<td>《义注》进一步指出，如果比丘自己做任何果汁饮料，他只能在中午前饮用。如果果汁是由非比丘制作并在中午之前正式地供养，则比丘「也」可以在中午之前与食物一起饮用——这里的「也」意味著原来的开缘仍然有效，即可以在中午之后和黎明之前不带食物地饮用。如果果汁是由非比丘制作并在中午之后正式地供养，则比丘可以在第二天黎明之前不带食物地饮用。芒果汁饮料的允许范围涵盖成熟或未成熟芒果制成的果汁。要制作未成熟芒果汁，建议将芒果切成或掰成小块，放入水中，在阳光下加热，然后过滤，并根据需要添加蜂蜜、糖和/或樟脑。用<em>芒果椴树（Bassia pierrei）</em>制成的果汁必须用水稀释，因为这种水果的未稀释果汁太浓稠。</td>

<tr><td>Edibles made from mixed ingredients that have different life spans—e.g., salted beef, honeyed cough syrup, sugared orange juice—have the same life span as the ingredient with the shortest life span. Thus salted beef is treated as beef, honeyed cough syrup as honey, and sugared orange juice as orange juice (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.40.3">Mv.VI.40.3</a>). According to the Commentary, <em>mixing</em> here means thorough intermingling. Thus, it says, if fruit juice has a whole, unhusked coconut floating in it, the coconut may be removed, and the juice is all right to drink until the following dawnrise. If butter is placed on top of rice porridge, the part of the butter that hasn’t melted into the rice may be kept and eaten for seven days. If items with different life spans are all presented at the same time, they maintain their separate life spans as long as they don’t interpenetrate one another. Not all Communities, however, follow the Commentary on this point.</td>
<td>由混合不同有效期限的食物成份制成的可食用物 —— 例如咸牛肉、蜂蜜止咳糖浆、加糖柳橙汁 —— 具有与有效期最短的食物成份相同的有效期。因此，咸牛肉被视为牛肉，蜂蜜止咳糖浆被视为蜂蜜，加糖柳橙汁被视为柳橙汁（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_006/#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a>）。根据《义注》，这里的<em>混合</em>意味著彻底混合。因此，它说，如果果汁中漂浮著一个完整的未去壳的椰子，则可以将椰子取出，果汁可以喝到第二天黎明。如果将奶油放在米粥上，那么没有融入米饭的部分的奶油可以保存和食用七天。如果同时存在具有不同有效期的物品，只要它们不相互渗透，它们就会保持各自的有效期。然而，并非所有僧团都在这一点上遵循《义注》。</td>

<tr><td>Translated in this way, the passage covers foods that are already mixed when presented to a bhikkhu. One of the general issues that led to the convening of the Second Council, however, concerned how to treat cases where foods received separately are then mixed by a bhikkhu. The specific issue presented to the Council was that of bhikkhus who kept a horn filled with salt so that they could add salt to bland foods. The Council’s verdict was that in doing so, the bhikkhus incurred a pācittiya under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>. The Vibhaṅga to that rule, however, gives a dukkaṭa for using, as food, life-long medicine that has been stored overnight, and salt is a life-long medicine. Thus the elders at the Council seem to have reasoned that if the salt has been mixed in with food, the mixture as a whole counts as food accepted when the first ingredient (the salt) was accepted: thus the pācittiya, rather than the dukkaṭa, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc38">Pc 38</a>. This principle is nowhere expressly stated in the texts, but is in some places taught as an oral tradition.</td>

<tr><td>The question the Commentary then raises is, “Why is the word ‘that day’ <em>(tadahu)</em> omitted from the last case?” Its answer is that there is no limit on when the medicine has to be received for it to be properly mixed with a tonic received today. In other words, it could have been received any number of days before the tonic was received. If it is mixed with the tonic on the first day of the tonic’s life span, the mixture as a whole has a seven-day life span. If mixed with the tonic on the second day of the tonic’s life, the mixture has a six-day life span, and so forth. The Commentary’s translation of this passage may strain standard Pali syntax, but it is grammatically correct and is the only way of deriving from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0043.html#Mv.VI.40.3">Mv.VI.40.3</a> a general principle to cover the issue of foods received separately that are then mixed by a bhikkhu. Thus the principle has been generally accepted that tonics and medicines, such as sugar and salt, received today may be eaten mixed with food or juice drinks received today, but not with food or juice drinks received on a later day. Medicine, such as salt, tea, or cocoa, received at any time may be eaten mixed with any of the five tonics on any day of the tonic’s life span.</td>
<td>《义注》接下来提出的问题是：「为什么在最后一种情况下省略了『当天』<em>（tadahu）</em>这个词？」答案是，没有限制何时接受药物以便将其与今天接受的补品适当地混合。换句话说，它可以是在接受补品之前的任何天接受的。如果它在补品的有效期的第一天与补品混合，则混合物作为一个整体拥有七天的有效期。如果在补品有效期的第二天与补品混合，则混合物拥有六天的有效期，依此类推。《义注》对这段话的翻译可能不符合标准巴利句法，但在语法上是正确的，并且是从<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_006/#0329a02">《大品》.六.40.3</a> 中得出涵盖比丘分开接受然后混合食物问题的一般原则的唯一方法。因此，普遍接受的原则是：今天接受的补品和药物（例如糖和盐）可以与今天收到的食物或果汁饮料混合食用，但不能与之后的日期里接受的食物或果汁饮料混合食用。任何时间接受的药物（例如盐、茶或可可）都可以与五种补品中的任何一种在补品有效期内的任何一天混合食用。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary’s conclusion, though, creates a problem when lay people want to invite Communities of more than three bhikkhus to their homes for a meal. Perhaps this problem is what induced the Commentary to interpret the Vibhaṅga’s definition of a <em>group meal</em> as meaning one in which the invitations specifically mention the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em>, or the type of meal or food to be served. (“Come to my house for breakfast tomorrow.” “I know you don’t often get a chance to eat Indian food, so I’m inviting you all over for chappatties and curry.”) This interpretation has led to the custom of phrasing invitations to eat “in the morning” or to eat “before noon,” so that groups of four or more bhikkhus may be invited without breaking this rule.</td>
<td>然而，《义注》的结论却带来了一个问题：当在家众想邀请超过三位比丘的僧团到家中用餐时，就会出现问题。或许正是这个问题促使《义注》将《经分别》对「<em>结众食</em>」的定义解读为，邀请中明确提到「<em>餐</em>」或「<em>食物</em>」一词，或具体提供餐食或食物种类。（「明天来我家吃早餐。」「我知道你们不常有机会吃印度菜，所以我邀请你们全部来吃印度薄饼和咖哩。」）这种解读导致了邀请措辞中出现「早上」吃或「中午之前」吃的习惯，这样，邀请四位或四位以上的比丘团体也不会违反这条戒条。</td>

<tr><td>The Buddha’s purposes for establishing this rule, though, are listed at Cv.VII.3.13 as follows: “For the restraint of evil-minded individuals, for the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, so that those with evil desires will not split the Community by (forming) a faction, and out of compassion for families.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of <em>group meal</em> accomplishes none of these purposes: The custom of phrasing invitations to avoid the word <em>meal</em> or <em>food</em> does nothing to restrain evil-minded individuals, etc., and it actually creates trouble for lay people who do not know the custom, a point well-illustrated by the Commentary itself in an entertaining section on how to deal with a person whose invitation contains the word <em>meal</em>. After getting the run-around from the meal designator—who apparently was not allowed to tell him in any straightforward way how to phrase his invitation and so gave him a long series of hints—the poor man returns to his friends and makes a cryptic statement that the A/Sub-commentary translates as: “There are a lot of words that have to be spoken in this business of making an invitation.

<tr><td>To find an alternative to the Commentary’s explanation, we have to go back to the origin stories leading to the reformulations of the rule, where we find an interesting point: The invitations rejected by scrupulous bhikkhus on the grounds that they would break the rule all deal with “invitational” meals. In one of them, a naked ascetic invites a group of bhikkhus to an invitational meal and is rejected on the grounds that it would constitute a group meal. He then goes to the Buddha and—after complaining that he should not be subjected to such treatment—rephrases the invitation, this time inviting the entire Community. This suggests that he felt an invitation of this sort would not constitute a group meal.</td>
<td>为了找到与《义注》不同的解释，我们必须追溯导致戒条被重新制定的起源故事，在那里我们发现了一个有趣的点：那些被严谨的比丘们以违反戒戒为由拒绝的邀请，都与「邀请」食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「别请食」]</span>有关。其中一则故事中，一位裸体苦行僧<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「裸形外道」]</span>邀请一群比丘参加邀请食，却被拒绝，理由是这会构成结众食。他随后来到佛陀面前，在抱怨自己不应遭受这种待遇之后，重新措辞了邀请，这次邀请的是整个僧团。这表明，他认为这种邀请不构成结众食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>His reasoning has its grounds in the Vinaya itself: Throughout the Vibhaṅga and Khandhakas, the word <em>group</em> is used to refer to any set of bhikkhus not forming a complete Community and yet acting as an independent unit. This may be why the category of Community meal was not mentioned in the non-offense clauses: The arrangers of the Vibhaṅga may have felt that no mention was necessary, in that the term <em>group</em> meal automatically excluded Community meals.</td>
<td>他的推论在戒律中自有其依据：在《经分别》和《犍度》中，「<em>结众</em>」一词被用来指任何未组成完整僧团，但仍作为独立单位行动的比丘群体。这或许就是为什么在不犯条款中没有提及僧团食这个类别的原因：《经分别》的编纂者可能认为没有必要提及，因为「<em>结众</em>」一词自动排除了僧团食。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Similar considerations suggest that designated meals may also be exempted from this rule even though they are not mentioned in the non-offense clauses. Invitations to such meals were customarily worded as requests for so-and-so many bhikkhus “from the Community,” and thus—as a type of Community meal—they would by definition not be invitations to a “group” meal.</td>
<td>类似的考虑表明，即使不犯条款中未提及指定食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「僧次请食」]</span>，也可不受此戒条约束。此类餐食的邀请习惯措词为「来自僧团」的某某多少比丘的请求，因此，作为一种僧团食，它们从定义上来说并非「结众」食的邀请。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because invitations to lottery meals and periodic meals did not customarily make reference to the Community, the Vibhaṅga arrangers did have to make mention of those types of meals in order to exempt them.</td>
<td>由于抽签食<span class="is-size-7">[译注：古汉译为「行筹食」]</span>和周期食的邀请通常不会提及僧团，因此《经分别》的编纂者必须提及这些类型的餐食才能免除它们。</td>

<td><em>我们剩下的戒条只适用于对四名或四名以上比丘的特定群体（而非僧团）的邀请，无论邀请中是否提到「食物」或「餐」一词。</em></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form has the virtue of fulfilling the express purposes mentioned for it in Cv.VII.3.13: It would prevent evil-minded bhikkhus and lay people from trying to exert influence over specific groups in the Community by arranging meals especially for them; and in the same way, it would prevent people with evil desires from creating a split in the Community. (Because the smallest faction that can create a split in the Community is four bhikkhus, the maximum number allowed at a group meal is three.)</td>
<td>这种形式的戒条，其优点在于能够实现<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_017/#0268a04">《小品》.七.3.13</a> 中明确提及的目的：它可以防止心怀恶欲的比丘和在家众，试图透过专门为僧团中的特定群体安排餐食来对他们施加影响；同样，它也可以防止心怀恶欲的人在僧团中制造分裂。（由于能够造成僧团分裂的最小派系是四位比丘，因此结众食允许的最大人数是三人。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule in this form would also contribute to the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus in that invitations to meals would not be preempted by factions; and it would protect lay families from being prey to the maneuverings of bhikkhus who would pressure them repeatedly into providing meals as part of their strategy to create and maintain such factions. (Anyone who has lived in a traditional Buddhist country knows only too well the influence of sweet-talking bhikkhus over unsuspecting or low-minded lay people. This sort of thing neither started nor ended with Devadatta.)</td>
<td>这种形式的戒条也能让品行端正的比丘们感到乐住，因为用餐邀请不会被派系抢先；它还能保护在家人免受比丘们的计谋的侵害。比丘们会反复施压，要求他们提供餐食，以此作为制造和维持派系的策略之一。（任何在传统佛教国家生活过的人都深知甜言蜜语的比丘们对毫无戒心或心境低下的在家人的影响。提婆达多既不是这种事的开端，也不是终结。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Because Community meals and designated meals would not form an opening for such machinations, there would be no reason to limit them to groups of three if lay people want to invite groups larger than that. One objection to exempting Community meals from this rule is that a meal for the entire Community would be more burdensome than a meal for a smaller group, but that is what designated meals are for. A donor willing and able to provide a meal for an entire Community is welcome but not required to do so. A donor willing but not able may simply ask to provide a meal for x-number of bhikkhus from the Community, leaving it up to the meal designator to designate which bhikkhus will go for the meal, with no danger of creating a faction.</td>
<td>因为僧团食和指定食不会为此类阴谋提供机会，所以如果在家众想邀请比三人更多的团体，没有理由将其限制在三人以内。有人反对将僧团食排除在这条戒条之外，因为为整个僧团提供一餐比为一小群人提供一餐更有负担，但指定食就是为了满足这一需求。愿意且有能力为整个僧团供餐的布施者欢迎但不强制要求这样做。愿意但无力提供的布施者可以直接要求为僧团中的x位比丘供餐，由餐食指定者指定哪些比丘来享用这餐，这样就不会有分裂的危险。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Thus the point at issue is not whether the invitation makes mention of food or meals, but whether it specifies the individual bhikkhus to be invited.</em> If it specifies more than three individual bhikkhus—either naming them outright or saying such things as “Ven.

<td><em>因此，问题的关键不在于邀请中是否提及食物或餐，而在于是否指定受邀的比丘。</em>如果邀请指定三位以上的比丘——无论是直接点名，还是诸如「X尊者和他的四位朋友」或「你们五位」之类的说法——那么这餐就算是结众食。</td>

<td>至于被邀请去用一顿餐的比丘却去了另一顿餐的该类辗转食，佛陀在与此戒条附属的一个故事中允许分享邀请：如果一位比丘收到了邀请，他可以将其给予另一个比丘或沙弥，说：「我把我的用餐期望给予某某。」然后，他就被允许在其他地方吃了。</td>

<tr><td>In addition to mentioning the “proper times” during which one may eat an out-of-turn meal, the non-offense clauses state that there is no penalty for a bhikkhu who, on receiving an invitation, states, “I will go for alms.” This statement the Commentary explains as a refusal, and interprets the allowance as meaning that if a bhikkhu refuses an invitation, he is still allowed to eat another meal at the time for which the invitation was made. If the Vibhaṅga arrangers did mean this statement to be a refusal, though, it is probably for the sake of those bhikkhus who hold to the <em>dhutaṅga</em> vow of going for alms and not accepting invitations. If a bhikkhu who does not hold to such a vow refuses an invitation for a time for which he has no prior commitment, it is considered very bad manners. And if he were later to accept an invitation for a meal served at the same time as the meal he earlier refused, it would be extremely bad manners.</td>
<td>除了提到可以吃辗转食的「适时」外，不犯条款还规定，如果比丘在收到邀请时说「我要去托钵」则没有惩罚。《义注》将此语句解释为拒绝，并将这项开缘解释为，如果比丘拒绝邀请，他仍然被允许在邀请的时间用另一餐。如果《经分别》的编纂者确实将此声明代表为拒绝，那么，这可能是为了那些持守<em>头陀行</em>誓言、去托钵而不接受邀请的比丘们。如果一位没有持守此誓言的比丘拒绝在他没有事先承诺的时间的邀请，则会被认为很不礼貌。而且如果他后来接受了与他之前拒绝的餐食同时提供的用餐邀请，那将是极其地不礼貌。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>An alternative explanation for the statement, “I will go for alms,” is that there is no offense if the bhikkhu lets the donor know beforehand that he will go for alms before the meal: He can have his alms meal first and then go to receive the meal offered by the donor. This would make room for the custom common in village monasteries throughout Theravādin countries, where invitations are usually for the late-morning meal, and bhikkhus are expected to have an early-morning alms meal before that. (If this interpretation does not hold, most village bhikkhus would then probably claim a perpetual “time of illness” as their exemption from this rule.)</td>
<td>「我要去托钵」这句话的另一种解释是，如果比丘事先告知施主他将在餐食之前去托钵，则并无犯戒：他可以先吃托钵所得之食，然后再去接受施主供养餐食。这可以解释上座部佛教国家村庄寺院中常见的习俗：通常邀请享用上午晚些时候的餐食，而比丘则应该在那之前享用一顿清晨的托钵所得之食。（如果这种解释不成立，那么大多数村庄比丘可能会声称自己有一段不断重复的「生病时」，以此作为此戒条的豁免。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Meals that do not include any of the five staple foods are also exempted from this rule. Thus if one is invited to a meal and takes a snack of milk, drinking conjey, fruit, etc., beforehand, this would not constitute an offense—although to be in keeping with the spirit of the rule, one should not take so much as to spoil one’s appetite for the meal.</td>
<td>不含五种主食的餐食也不受此戒条约束。因此，如果受邀请赴餐食，并在之前吃点牛奶、喝稀粥、水果等零食，则不构成犯戒——不过，为了符合此戒条的精神，不应吃太多，以免影响用餐时的胃口。</td>

<td>如果在同一天收到多份餐食邀请，并按照收到邀请的顺序前往就餐（但参见<a class="reference external" href="#Pc35">《波逸提》三五</a>），则不构成犯戒；如果将接收的各个邀请的食物一起放在钵里，同时吃掉；或者，如果收到全村人的邀请，去村里任何地方吃饭。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary, in discussing this point, mentions a situation that often occurs where there are very few bhikkhus in proportion to the number of donors: A bhikkhu has been invited to a meal but, before he leaves the monastery to go to the meal, another group of donors arrives with food to place in his bowl; or after he arrives at the home of the original donor, another group of donors arrives with still more food. According to the Commentary he may accept the food of these various donors as long as he is careful—when he finally eats—to take his first mouthful from the food offered by the original donor.</td>
<td>《义注》在讨论这一点时提到了一种常见的情况，即比丘的数量相对于施主的数量来说非常少：一位比丘受邀赴餐食，但在他离开寺院去赴餐之前，另一群施主带著食物来到并放入他的钵中；或者在他到达最先的施主家后，又有一群施主带著更多的食物到来。根据《义注》，他可以接受这些施主的食物，只要当他在最终进食时小心地在第一口食物时吃掉最先的施主供养的食物即可。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The non-offense clauses also state that periodic meals and lottery meals do not count as out-of-turn meals under this rule, but the Vibhaṅga offers no explanation as to why. The Commentary to Cullavagga VI.21 shows that the custom was for many families to prepare such meals on the same day. This exemption would thus seem to provide for the situation where there are fewer bhikkhus than there are families preparing these meals. One bhikkhu would be allowed to accept more than one meal so that no family’s meal would go without a recipient.</td>

<tr><td>When a donor invited bhikkhus for a meal, the custom in the time of the Buddha was for him/her to offer food to the bhikkhus repeatedly while they ate, and to stop only when the supplies of food were exhausted or the bhikkhus refused any further offers. (This custom is still widespread in Sri Lanka and Burma.) Thus it was often a matter of pride among donors that their supplies were not easily exhausted and that they could continue offering food until the bhikkhus were completely satisfied and could eat no more. Now, where there is pride there is bound to be wounded pride: A donor could easily feel insulted if bhikkhus refused further offers of food, finished their meal, and then went to eat someplace else.</td>
<td>佛陀时代的习俗是，当布施者邀请比丘们用餐时，布施者会在比丘们用餐时反复供养食物给比丘们，直到食物耗尽或比丘们拒绝更进一步供养时才停止。（这项习俗在斯里兰卡和缅甸至今仍盛行。）因此，这往往是布施者的骄傲，因为他们的供养不容易耗尽，而且他们可以继续供养食物，直到比丘们完全吃饱，再也吃不下为止。然而，哪里有自尊心，哪里的自尊心就必然受到伤害：如果比丘们拒绝更进一步供养食物，用完餐后又去其他地方吃东西，布施者很容易感到被冒犯。</td>

<tr><td><em>Having eaten (bhuttāvin)</em>, according to the Vibhaṅga, means having eaten any of the five staple foods, “even as much as a blade of grass.” On the surface, this could mean one of two things: having taken one’s first bite of a meal or having finished a meal—even the smallest possible one. The Commentary adopts the first interpretation, but in doing so creates two problems:</td>
<td>根据《经分别》，<em>「吃过」（bhuttāvin）</em>的意思是吃过五种主食中的任何一种，「哪怕只是一小片草」。表面上，这可能意味著两种情况之一：用餐吃过第一口或用餐完毕——哪怕是一小口。《义注》采用了第一种解读，但这样做却带来了两个问题：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1) If <em>having eaten</em> means having taken one’s first bite of a meal, then the word serves no purpose in the rule, because the first factor of “having turned down an offer of further food” is “the bhikkhu is eating,” and as the Commentary itself notes, if one is eating then one has already taken one’s first bite of the meal. It concludes that the word <em>having eaten</em>, both in the rule and in the Vibhaṅga, is completely superfluous.</td>
<td>1）如果「<em>吃过</em>」的意思是用餐吃过第一口，那么这个词在戒条中就毫无意义，因为「<em>已拒绝了更进一步的食物供养</em>」的第一个因素是「比丘正在吃」，而正如《义注》本身所指出的，如果一个人正在吃，那么该人已经用餐吃过第一口。它得出结论，「吃过」这个词，无论在戒条中或在《经分别》中，都是完全多余的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>2) A more practical problem coming from the Commentary’s interpretation is that if one turns down an offer of extra food when one already has more than enough food in one’s bowl but has yet to finish one’s meal, one cannot continue eating. The Commentary tries to get around this predicament by introducing an additional factor: As long as one does not move from the spot on which one is sitting, one may continue eating. This, though, creates further problems: Suppose a bhikkhu has turned down an offer of further food but has yet to finish his meal. If there is then some compelling reason for him to move from the spot on which he is sitting—for example, the donor spills a pot of hot soup, or ants come crawling into his robes—then he cannot finish his meal even if the donor begs him to continue eating.</td>
<td>2）《义注》的解读引发了一个更实际的问题是，如果钵里已经有足够多的食物但还没吃完，而拒绝了额外的食物供养，那就不能继续吃。《义注》试图透过引入一个额外的因素来解决这个困境：只要不离开所坐的位置，就可以继续吃饭。然而，这又带来了进一步的问题：假设一位比丘拒绝了更进一步的食物供养但还没用完餐。如果有某种令人信服的理由迫使他离开所坐的位置——例如，布施者打翻了一锅热汤，或者蚂蚁爬进了他的袈裟——那么即使布施者恳求他继续吃饭，他也不能用完餐。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Sub-commentary gets around the first problem by interpreting <em>having eaten</em> as “having finished a meal,” which fits better with the origin story and with the linguistic usage of the Canon itself. (The word <em>bhuttāvin</em> also appears in MN 91, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.4.3-6">Cv.VIII.4.6</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.11.2-18">Cv.VIII.11.5</a>, where it clearly and consistently means “having finished a meal.” The Canon uses a separate term, <em>asana</em>, for one who is in the process of eating a meal without yet having finished it.) The author of the Sub-commentary doesn’t realize, though, that in adopting this interpretation he is also eliminating the need for the Commentary’s extra factor concerning moving from one’s spot. If the factor is unnecessary and has no basis in the Canon, there seems no reason to adopt it. Thus the Commentary’s factor, and not the wording of the rule, is what is superfluous. So we can say that <em>having eaten</em> means having finished one’s meal, and that the question of having moved from one’s spot doesn’t enter into the rule.</td>
<td>《复注》透过将「<em>吃过</em>」解释为「用餐完毕」来规避第一个问题，这更符合起源故事和《圣典》本身的语言用法。（ <em>bhuttāvin</em> 一词也出现在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zhong/content/091.html">《中部》91经</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0293a07">《小品》.八.4.6</a> 和<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0302a12">《小品》.八.11.5</a> 中，在这些经文中，它明确且一致地表示「用餐完毕」。《圣典》使用了一个单独的术语 <em>asana</em> 来指正在用餐但尚未完毕的人。）然而，《复注》的作者没有意识到，透过采用这种解释，他也消除了《义注》中关于从位置移动的额外因素的需要。如果这个因素是不必要的，而且在《圣典》中没有依据，那么似乎也没有理由采用它。因此，多余的是《义注》中的因素，而不是戒条的措辞。所以我们可以说，「<em>吃过</em>」意味著已经用餐完毕，而是否离开位置的问题并不在戒条之内。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As the Commentary itself notes when discussing the term <em>asana</em>, the point where one finishes eating is determined in one of two ways:</td>
<td>正如《义注》本身在讨论 <em>asana</em> 该术语时所指出的，用餐完毕的时间点是透过以下两种方式之一来决定的：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>a) There is no food left in one’s bowl, hand, or mouth; or</td>
<td>a）钵里、手里或嘴里没有食物；或者</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>b) one decides that one has had enough for that particular meal.</td>
<td>b）决定自己已经吃饱了那餐。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, as long as the bhikkhu has not yet finished the donor’s meal, he is free to turn down, accept, and eat food as he likes. In other words, if he turns down an offer of further food, he may continue eating what is left in his bowl. If he initially turns down an offer of further food but then gives in and accepts it after being pressured by the donor, he may eat what he accepts without penalty. Or if he feels, for example, that he has enough vegetables but would like more rice, he may turn down an offer of vegetables yet accept and eat an offer of rice that follows it.</td>
<td>因此，只要比丘尚未吃完施主的供养，他就可以自由地随意拒绝、接受和食用食物。换句话说，如果他拒绝了施主提供的更多食物，他可以继续吃钵里剩下的食物。如果他最初拒绝了施主提供的更多食物，但在施主的催促下屈服并接受了，他可以继续吃他接受的食物而不受惩罚。或者，例如，如果他觉得蔬菜已经足够，但想要更多的米饭，他可以拒绝蔬菜的供养，但接受并食用随后供养的米饭。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>But once he no longer has any food in his bowl, hand, or mouth, or has decided that he has had enough for that particular meal, he fulfills the factor of “having eaten” under this rule. If he turned down an offer of further food before finishing the meal, he may not for the remainder of the day eat any staple or non-staple foods that are not leftovers.</td>
<td>但一旦他的钵里、手里或嘴里没有食物，或者他决定该餐已经吃饱了，他就满足了这条戒条下「吃过」的因素。如果他在用完餐之前拒绝了更进一步食物的供养，那么在当天剩余的时间里，他不得吃任何非剩余的主食或副食。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if the bhikkhu has finished eating before the further food is offered, factor (1) is not fulfilled, so if he turns down the food he does not fall under the terms of this rule. Similarly, if the food in factor (2) is not a staple food—e.g., if it is fruit, chocolates, or cheese—or if it is staple food of a sort unallowable for a bhikkhu to eat—e.g., it has been offered as a result of a bhikkhu’s claiming a superior human state or corrupting a family (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg13">Sg 13</a>), or it is made of human flesh or snake meat, etc.—the factor is not fulfilled. Because none of the texts specify that the donor under factor (3) must be unordained, a bhikkhu offering food to a fellow bhikkhu would apparently fulfill this factor as well. Thus this rule would apply not only to meals offered by lay donors, but also to food handed out by bhikkhus and novices in a monastery.</td>
<td>《义注》补充道，如果比丘在更进一步供养食物之前已经吃完，则不满足因素（1），因此如果他拒绝食物，则不属于本戒条的范畴。同样，如果因素（2）中的食物不是主食（例如，水果、巧克力或奶酪），或者属于比丘禁食的主食—例如，由于比丘自称上人法或污家而被供养的（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0011/#Sg13">《僧残》十三</a>），或者食物由人肉或蛇肉制成等—则不满足该因素。由于没有任何文献明确规定因素（3）中的布施者必须是未出家者，因此，比丘向比丘同侪供养食物显然也满足本因素。因此，这条戒条不仅适用于在家布施者所供养的食物，也适用于寺院中比丘和沙弥所分发的食物。</td>

(Some have misread one of the “wheels” of offenses listed in the Vibhaṅga to this rule as applying to Y, but because they conflict with the offenses the Vibhaṅga to the preceding rule allots to Y for eating under a misperception, that reading cannot stand. Thus the Commentary seems right in stating that all the offenses mentioned in the Vibhaṅga to this rule apply to X.)

Noon is reckoned as the moment the sun reaches its zenith, rather than by the clock—in other words, by local rather than standard or daylight-savings time. Thus, for example, a bhikkhu who is offered food while traveling in an airplane should check the position of the sun in order to determine whether he may accept and eat it.

<tr><td>The Commentary generally defines eating as going down the throat, but a passage from the Cullavagga (V.25) suggests otherwise. In it, the Buddha allows a ruminator who brings up food to his mouth at the “wrong time” to swallow it, and ends with the statement: “But food that has been brought out from the mouth should not be taken back in. Whoever should take it in is to be dealt with according to the rule (i.e., this rule and the following one).” This suggests, then, that eating is technically defined as “taking into the mouth.”</td>

The Vibhaṅga doesn’t answer the question, but the Commentary does, saying that the dukkaṭa is for accepting the food in the wrong time. The Vibhaṅga goes on to say that if the bhikkhu eats staple or non-staple food at the wrong time he incurs a pācittiya for every mouthful he eats.

Using the Great Standards, we may say that a bhikkhu who has a similar illness or worse may take these broths at any time; and some have argued that other bean broths—such as strained broth made from boiled soybeans—would fit under the category of green gram broth as well.

As far as I have been able to ascertain, miso is not used to cure diseases in adults even in China, which would be the place to look for its use as a medicine. However, even if the allowance does apply to miso, taking miso broth as food in the wrong time would entail a dukkaṭa.</td>

<tr><td>This is one of the few rules where the original instigator was an arahant: Ven. Beḷaṭṭhasīsa, Ven. Ānanda’s preceptor and formerly the head of the 1,000 ascetics who attained Awakening on hearing the Fire Sermon (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN35_28.html">SN 35:28</a>). The origin story here reports that he made a practice of keeping leftover rice from his alms round, drying it, and then moistening it to eat on a later day. As a result, he only rarely had to go out for alms. Even though he was doing this out of frugality rather than greed, the Buddha still rebuked him. The story doesn’t give the precise reasons for the rebuke. Perhaps it was because the Buddha saw that such behavior would open the way for bhikkhus to avoid going on alms round, thus depriving themselves of the excellent opportunity that alms-going provides for reflecting on their dependency on others and on the human condition in general; and depriving the laity of the benefits that come from daily contact with the bhikkhus and the opportunity to practice generosity of the most basic sort every day. Although frugality may be a virtue, there are times when other considerations supercede it.</td>
<td>这是少数最初犯戒者是阿罗汉的戒条之一：毘拉陀施沙尊者，阿难尊者的戒师，曾是听闻《燃烧经》而觉醒的一千名苦行者的领袖（<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/xiangying/content/35.html#%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E5%85%AB%E7%87%83%E7%87%92">《相应部》35:28经</a>）。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N02n0001_005/#0115a12">这里的起源故事报导说，他习惯将托钵剩下的米饭留著，晒干，然后弄湿以便之后的日子吃。</a>结果，他很少出去托钵。尽管他这样做是出于节俭而不是贪欲，但佛陀仍然诃责了他。故事没有给出诃责的具体原因。也许是因为佛陀认为这种行为会让比丘们逃避托钵，从而剥夺了托钵提供的反思对他人的依赖和人类普遍状况的绝佳机会；剥夺了在家人与比丘们日常接触所带来的利益，以及每天实践最基本布施的机会。虽然节俭可能是一种美德，但有时其他考虑会取代它。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Another possible reason for this rule is expressed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN5_80.html">AN 5:80</a>: “In the course of the future there will be bhikkhus who will live entangled with monastery attendants and novices. As they are entangled with monastery attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on many kinds of stored-up consumables and on making blatant signs (identifying their) land and crops.” The Buddha showed great foresight in seeing this as a danger. Over the centuries, whenever bhikkhus have lived in Communities where vast stores of food were kept—such as the great Buddhist universities in India—they have tended to grow lax in their practice, and a gulf of misunderstanding and suspicion has come to separate them from the laity.</td>
<td>这条戒条的另一个可能原因在<a class="reference external" href="https://sutra.mobi/chilin/zengzhi/content/05.html#%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%81%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B">《增支部》5:80经</a>中有所阐述：「在未来，将有比丘与寺院侍者和沙弥纠缠不清。由于他们与寺院侍者和沙弥纠缠不清，可以预见，他们将热衷于各种囤积的消耗品，并制作明显的标志（来表明他们的）土地和农作物。」佛陀很有远见，体认到了这是一种危险。几个世纪以来，每当比丘生活在储存大量食物的僧团——例如印度的大型佛教大学——他们的修行就会变得懈怠，误解和猜疑的鸿沟也逐渐将他们与在家人隔开。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary contains an allowance of its own, saying that, “If a bhikkhu without desire (for the food) abandons it to a novice, and the novice, having stored it (overnight) gives it (again), that is all allowable. If, however, he has received it himself and has not abandoned it, it is not proper on the second day.” This allowance raises two main questions, the first being how to interpret it. Some, focusing on the second sentence to the exclusion of the first, have noticed that it makes no mention of the presence or absence of any desire for the food, and so have interpreted it as meaning that the issue of desire is totally irrelevant: If one has not given the food to a non-bhikkhu, it is not allowable; if one has given it away, it is. This interpretation, however, ignores the point that if the presence or absence of desire for the food were irrelevant, the first sentence would not have mentioned it. Both the Old and New K/Sub-commentaries note this point, and say the <em>abandoning</em> in the second sentence means “abandoning without desire.” In other words, the Commentary’s allowance is meant to apply only in cases where one has abandoned both the food and any desire to receive it back.</td>
<td>《义注》包含一项它自己的开缘，说：「若比丘（对食物）无欲望，舍弃给沙弥，沙弥将它储存（过夜）后（再）行给予之，则那皆允许。然而，若他自己接受而未舍弃之，则次日不宜。」这项开缘引发了两个主要问题，第一是如何解读它。有些人只关注第二句而忽略第一句，发现第二句并未提及对食物是否有欲望，因此将其解读为与欲望的问题完全无关：若未将食物给予非比丘，则它是不允许的；若已将其赠与出去，则它是允许的。然而，这种解读忽略了一点：若对食物是否有欲望无关，则第一句话就不会提及。新旧 K/《复注》均指出了这一点，并解释第二句中的<em>舍弃</em>是「无欲望地舍弃」。换句话说，《义注》的开缘仅适用于既舍弃了食物，又舍弃了任何想要重新获得食物的欲望的情况。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This, however, begs the second question, which is what justification the Commentary has for making the allowance. There is no basis for it in the Vibhaṅga’s definition of “stored-up,” nor is there anything else in the Vibhaṅga to this rule from which the Great Standards could be used to support the allowance. The Commentary is apparently importing one of the non-offense clauses from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP23">NP 23</a> to this rule, but that is a misapplication of the Great Standards. The Vibhaṅga for one rule cannot be used to rewrite the Vibhaṅga for another; otherwise there would be no end to the rewriting of the rules. Had the compilers meant for the principle under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0015.html#NP23">NP 23</a> to be applied here, they could have done so themselves. For these reasons, there seem to be no grounds for accepting the allowance as valid. Thus, if one abandons food received today then, regardless of whether one has abandoned desire for it, if one accepts it again on a later day and eats it, one commits the full offense under this rule all the same. For further analysis of this point, see the article, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/StoredUpFood.html">Stored-up Food: A Discussion of Pācittaya 38</a>.</td>
<td>但这又引出了第二个问题，就是《义注》有何依据允许这种做法。《经分别》对「储存」的定义中没有这种依据，《经分别》中也没有任何其他内容可以用《四大教示》来支持这项开缘。《义注》显然是将<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0015/#NP23">《舍堕》二三</a>中的一条不犯条款引入这条戒条中，但这是对《四大教示》的误用。某一条戒条的《经分别》不能用来重写另一条戒条的《经分别》，否则戒条的重写将永无止境。如果编纂者有意将<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0015/#NP23">《舍堕》二三</a>中的原则应用于此，他们自己就可以这样做。因此，似乎没有理由认为接受这项开缘是有效的。因此，如果舍弃今天接受的食物，那么无论是否已经舍弃了对该食物的欲望，如果在之后的某一天再次接受并食用，仍然会完全违犯此戒条。关于这一点的进一步分析，请参阅文章<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/StoredUpFood.html">储存食物：《波逸提》三八的讨论（英文）</a>。</td>

One suggestion for resolving this issue would be to borrow a page from the Commentary’s treatment of a revoked banishment-transaction (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg13">Sg 13</a>). This would mean that if—after the original offering of food—those who know of the request continue offering that sort of food, one must tell them that one may not accept the food because of the penalty it would entail. If, without further prompting, they say that they are offering the food not because of the request but because of their own independent desire to offer it, one may accept it and consume it.</td>
<td>另一个在任何文献中都没有讨论的问题是，如果收到请求或知晓请求的人继续提供所请求的该种食物，该怎么办？是否终身禁止再次接受他们提供的该种食物？解决这个问题的一个建议是藉用《义注》中关于撤销驱出羯磨的处理（见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0011/#Sg13">《僧残》十三</a>）。这意味著，如果在最初提供食物之后，那些知晓请求的人继续提供该种食物，必须告诉他们，由于可能带来的惩罚，因此不能接受食物。如果他们无需进一步提示就说他们提供食物不是因为请求，而是出于他们自己的意愿，那么可以接受并食用。</td>

<tr><td><em>Not ill</em> means that one is able to fare comfortably without these foods. None of the texts go into detail on this point, but <em>ill</em> probably means something more than simply being hungry, for there is a separate allowance under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0026.html#Sk37">Sk 37</a> for a bhikkhu who is hungry to ask for rice and bean curry, which was the basic diet of the day, and the Commentary extends the allowance to cover all foods not covered by this rule. Here <em>ill</em> probably refers to any form of fatigue, weakness, or malnutrition that comes specifically from lacking any of the foods mentioned in the rule.</td>
<td>「无病」指的是即使没有这些食物也能过得舒服。所有文献都没有详细阐述这一点，但「<em>生病</em>」的含义可能远不止饥饿，因为<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0026.html#Sk37">《应学》三七</a>中有一项单独的开缘，饥饿的比丘可以要求米饭和豆咖哩，这是当时的基本饮食。《义注》也将此开缘扩及所有未包含在这条戒条中的食物。这里的「<em>生病</em>」可能指的是任何形式的疲劳、虚弱或营养不良，具体来说，是由于缺乏该戒条中提到的任何食物而引起的。</td>

<tr><td>Perception as to whether one is actually ill is not a mitigating factor here (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</td>
<td>对于是否真的生病的感知并不是减轻惩罚的因素（参见<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/zh-hans/Section0016/#Pc4">《波逸提》四</a>）。</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds that if a bhikkhu asks for one kind of finer staple food but receives another kind instead, he incurs the dukkaṭa for asking, but no penalty for accepting and eating what he gets. It also notes that when a bhikkhu asks a lay person for any of the finer staple foods, and the lay person makes a donation of money to the bhikkhu’s steward to buy that food, then once the food is bought it comes under this rule all the same.</td>
<td>《义注》补充道，如果比丘请求一种较精致的主食，却收到另一种，他会因请求而犯《突吉罗》，但接受并食用他所得到的食物则不会受到惩罚。《义注》还指出，如果比丘向居士请求任何较精致的主食，而居士向比丘的净人布施金钱以购买该食物，那么一旦食物被购买，也同样适用此戒条。</td>
