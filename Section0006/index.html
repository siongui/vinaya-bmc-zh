<tr><td>Dhamma-Vinaya was the Buddha’s own name for the religion he founded. Dhamma—the truth—is what he discovered and pointed out as advice for all who want to gain release from suffering. Vinaya—discipline—is what he formulated as rules, ideals, and standards of behavior for those of his followers who go forth from home life to take up the quest for release in greater earnestness. Although this book deals primarily with discipline, we should note at the outset that total training in the Buddha’s path requires that Dhamma and Vinaya function together. In theory they may be separate, but in the person who practices them they merge as qualities developed in the mind and character.</td>
<td>Dhamma-Vinaya（法與律）是佛陀對自己所創立的宗教的名字。法（Dhamma）——真理——是他發現並指出的，作為對所有想要從痛苦中解脫的人的建議。律（Vinaya）是他為追隨者制定的規則、理想和行為標準。這些追隨者離開家庭生活，更加認真地尋求解脫。雖然本書主要討論戒律，但我們首先應該注意，佛陀道路上的全面修行需要法與律的共同作用。從理論上講，它們可能是分開的，但對於實踐它們的人來說，它們作為心靈和性格中發展的品質而融合在一起。</td>

「戒律是為了克制，克制是為了無悔，無悔是為了歡悅，歡悅是為了喜，喜是為了輕安，輕安是為了樂，樂是為了定，定是為了如實知見，如實知見是為了厭離，厭離是為了離欲，離欲是為了解脫，解脫是為了解脫知見，解脫知見是為了無取著般涅槃。」——<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/reference/external-link/#pv-xii-2">《附隨》.十二.2</a></div>

此可追溯《中阿含經》卷10〈習相應品〉第五，有16部經都有如下類似的說明：「阿難！因持戒便得不悔。因不悔便得歡悅。 因歡悅便得喜。因喜便得止。因止便得樂。因樂便得定。阿難！多聞聖弟子因定，便得見如實、知如真。因見如實、知如真，便得厭。因厭便得無欲。因無欲便得解脫。因解脫便知解脫︰生已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦，不更受有，知如真。阿難﹗是為法法相益，法法相因。如是此戒趣至第一，謂度此岸，得至彼岸」。
此次第可以簡化如下︰持戒→無悔→歡悅→心喜→身安（輕安）→樂→心定→如實知見→厭→離欲→解脫→知解脫（自謂︰我證解脫。復起如是智見︰我生已盡、梵行已立、所作已辦，不受後有）。

<tr><td>In establishing his religion of release, though, the Buddha did not simply set out a body of recommendations and rules. He also founded a company (<em>parisā</em>) of followers. This company falls into four main groups: bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunīs (nuns), lay men, and lay women. Although the Buddha saw no need to organize the laity in any manner, he arranged for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs—who had given up the entanglements of the household life to devote themselves more fully to the goal of release—to develop into communities. And he saw that they needed, as all communities do, ideals and standards, rules and customs to ensure their stability. This need is what gave rise to the Vinaya.</td>
<td>然而，在建立他的解脫宗教時，佛陀並沒有僅只提出一系列建議和規則。他還創立了追隨眾（ <em>parisā</em> ）。該眾分為四個主要群體：比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞（男在家）和優婆夷（女在家）。雖然佛陀認為沒有必要以任何方式組織在家眾，但他安排比丘和比丘尼——他們已經放棄了家庭生活的糾纏，更充分地致力於解脫的目標——發展成團體。他認為，正如所有團體一樣，他們需要理想和標準、規則和習俗來確保穩定。這種需要就是戒律的產生。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In the early years of the Buddha’s career, the texts tell us, there was no need to formulate monastic disciplinary rules. All of the bhikkhus in his following—the Community of bhikkhunīs had not yet been started—were men of high personal attainments who had succeeded in subduing many or all of their mental defilements. They knew his teachings well and behaved accordingly. The Canon tells of how Ven. Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, asked the Buddha at an early date to formulate a Pāṭimokkha, or code of rules, to ensure that the celibate life the Buddha had founded would last long, just as a thread holding together a floral arrangement ensures that the flowers are not scattered by the wind. The Buddha replied that the time for such a code had not yet come, for even the most backward of the men in the Community at that time had already had their first glimpse of the goal. Only when mental effluents (<em>āsava</em>) made themselves felt in the Community would there be a need for a Pāṭimokkha.</td>
<td>文獻告訴我們，在佛陀生涯的早期，沒有必要制戒。他追隨者中的所有比丘——比丘尼僧團尚未成立——都是具有很高個人成就的人，他們已經成功地降伏了許多或全部的心理煩惱。他們非常了解他的教導，並按照他的教導行事。《聖典》講述了舍利弗尊者是佛陀的上首弟子之一，他很早就請求佛陀制定《波羅提木叉》戒律，以確保佛陀所創立的梵行生活能夠久住，就像用一根線將插花連接在一起一樣，花不會被風吹散。佛陀回答說，制戒的時候還沒有到來，因為即使是當時僧團中最落後的人也已經得法眼淨。只有當漏（ <em>āsava</em> ）在僧團中出現時，才會需要《波羅提木叉》。</td>

<tr><td>As time passed, the conditions that provided an opening for the effluents within the Community eventually began to appear. The Bhaddāli Sutta (MN 65) presents the Buddha at a later point in his career listing these conditions as five:</td>

<p>Ven. Bhaddāli: “Why is it, venerable sir, that there used to be fewer training rules and more bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening? And why is it that there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening?” [Bhaddāli, who has been unwilling to abide by the training rules, seems to be suggesting that the rise in the number of training rules is itself the cause for fewer bhikkhus’ attaining Awakening. The Buddha, however, offers a different explanation.]</p>
<p>The Buddha: “So it is, Bhaddāli. When beings have begun to degenerate and the true Dhamma has begun to disappear, there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus established in the knowledge of Awakening. The Teacher does not lay down a training rule for his disciples as long as there are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community. But when there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community, then the Teacher lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.</p>
<p>“There are no cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents have arisen in the Community as long as the Community has not become large. But when the Community has become large, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.... When the Community possesses great material gains... great status... a large body of learning… When the Community is long-standing, then there are cases where the conditions that offer a foothold for the effluents arise in the Community, and the Teacher then lays down a training rule for his disciples so as to counteract those very conditions.”</p>

<tr><td>Thus the rules themselves were not the cause for degeneracy in the Community, and the conditions that provided a foothold for the effluents were not themselves effluents. Rather, the growing complexity of the Community provided the opportunity for bhikkhus to act on the basis of their defilements in a growing variety of ways, and the rules—although they could not prevent any of the five conditions—had to become correspondingly complex to counteract the opportunities those conditions provided for unenlightened behavior.</td>
<td>因此，戒律本身並不是僧團墮落的原因，為漏提供立足點的因緣本身也不是漏。相反，僧團的日益複雜性為比丘們提供了機會，以越來越多的方式根據他們的煩惱採取行動，而戒律——儘管它們不能阻止五種因緣中的任何一種——必須變得相對應地複雜以抵銷這些因緣為無明的行為提供的機會。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Even when these conditions did arise, though, the Buddha did not set out a full code at once. Instead, he formulated rules one at a time in response to events. The considerations that went into formulating each rule are best illustrated by the events surrounding the formulation of the first.</td>
<td>然而，即使這些因緣確實出現，佛陀也沒有立即制定完整的戒律。相反，他針對事件一次一個地制戒。制定每個戒條時所考慮的因素可以透過圍繞第一個戒條制定時的事件得到最好的說明。</td>

His parents, fearing that the government would confiscate their property at their death if it had no heir, devised various schemes to lure Ven. Sudinna back to the lay life, but to no avail. Finally, his mother realized that he was firm in his intention to stay a bhikkhu and so asked him at least to have intercourse with his former wife so that their property would have an heir. Ven. Sudinna consented, took his wife into the forest, and had intercourse three times.</td>
<td>據說， <a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/s/sudinna-kalandakaputta/">須提那迦蘭陀子</a> 尊者對佛陀有著堅定的信心，並在父母勉強同意後出家。他是父母唯一的孩子，雖然已婚，但沒有孩子。他的父母擔心，如果他們死後沒有繼承人，政府會沒收他們的財產，因此設計了各種計劃來引誘須提那尊者重回俗家生活，但卻無效。最後，他的母親意識到他做比丘的決心很堅定，所以要求他至少和他的前妻發生性關係，這樣他們的財產就有繼承人。須提那尊者答應了，帶著妻子走進森林，發生了三次性關係。</td>

<tr><td>Immediately he felt remorse and eventually confessed his deed to his fellow bhikkhus. Word reached the Buddha, who called a meeting of the Community, questioned Ven. Sudinna, and gave him a rebuke. The rebuke fell into two major parts. In the first part, the Buddha reminded Ven. Sudinna of his position as a <em>samaṇa</em> —a monk or contemplative—and that his behavior was unworthy of his position. Also, the Buddha pointed out to him the aims of the teaching and noted that his behavior ran counter to them. The implication here was that Ven. Sudinna had not only acted inconsistently with the content of the teaching, but had also shown callous disregard for the Buddha’s compassionate aims in making the Dhamma known.</td>
<td>他立刻感到後悔，並最終向同儕比丘坦白了自己的行為。消息傳到了佛陀那裡，佛陀召開了一次僧團會議，詢問了須提那尊者，並訶責了他。訶責分為兩個主要部分。第一部分，佛陀提醒須提那尊者，指出他作為 <em>samaṇa</em> （沙門）的地位，以及他的行為與他的地位不相稱。此外，佛陀向他指出了教法的目的，並指出他的行為與這些目的背道而馳。這裡的意思是須提那尊者的行為不僅與佛法的內容不符，而且還冷酷無情地漠視佛陀弘揚佛法的慈悲目的。</td>
