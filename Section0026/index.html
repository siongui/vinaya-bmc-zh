<tr><td>This term means “to be trained in.” There are 75 training rules in this category, divided by subject into four groups: etiquette in dressing and behaving when in inhabited areas; etiquette in accepting and eating almsfood; etiquette when teaching the Dhamma; and etiquette in urinating, defecating, and spitting.</td>
<td>這個術語的意思是「應當學」。此類別共有75條學處，依主題分為四類：在俗家間的穿著和行為的禮儀；接受和食用缽食的禮儀；講授佛法的禮儀；以及小便、大便和吐痰的禮儀。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The rules themselves do not impose a direct penalty. Instead, they simply say, “(This is) a training to be observed.” The Vibhaṅga, though, says that to violate any of these rules out of disrespect incurs a dukkaṭa. The non-offense clauses state in each case that to violate them unintentionally, unthinkingly, or unknowingly, or to disobey them when there are dangers or (in most cases) when one is ill, incurs no penalty. (The exemption for dangers is not in the Burmese edition of the Canon.)</em></td>
<td><em>這些戒條本身並沒有直接規定懲罰，只是僅僅說：「（這是）應當學。」然而，《經分別》指出，出於不敬而違反任何這些戒條都會犯《突吉羅》。每條戒條的不犯條款都明確規定，無意、不經思考或不知情地違反戒條，或在危險情況下或（大多數情況下）生病時違反戒條，都不會受到懲罰。（緬甸版的《聖典》中沒有關於危險情況的豁免條款。）</em></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The Commentary adds that</em> unknowingly <em>in this case does not mean not knowing the rule. For a new bhikkhu not to make the effort to know the rules, it says, would qualify as disrespect. So</em> unknowingly <em>here means not knowing that a situation contrary to the rules has developed. For instance, if one does not know that one’s robes have gotten out of kilter, that would not count as a breach of the relevant rule.</em></td>
<td><em>《義註》補充道，此處的「</em>不知情地<em>」並非指不知道戒條。它指出，對於一位新比丘而言，若不努力去知道戒條，則構成不敬。因此，此處的「</em>不知情地<em>」指的是不知到已出現違反戒條的情況。例如，若不知曉自己的袈裟歪斜，則不算違反相關戒條。</em></td>

<td>《聖典》中記載了幾個比丘的行為如何使他人對佛法產生興趣的故事。其中最著名的例子是舍利弗尊者與<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E9%98%BF%E8%AA%AA%E7%A4%BA">阿說示尊者</a>初次相遇的故事。</td>

Assaji, dressing early in the morning, taking his bowl and (outer) robe, entered Rājagaha for alms: gracious in the way he approached and departed, looked forward and behind, drew in and stretched out (his arm); his eyes downcast, his every movement consummate. Sāriputta the wanderer saw Ven. Assaji going for alms in Rājagaha: gracious… his eyes downcast, his every movement consummate. On seeing him, the thought occurred to him: ‘Surely, of those bhikkhus in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship, this is one.

<tr><td><em>To wear the lower robe wrapped around</em> means to wear the upper edge circling the waist, covering the navel, and the lower edge covering the kneecaps. This is called covering the “three circles.” The Commentary states that when one is standing, the lower edge should be not more than eight fingerbreadths below the knees, although if one’s calves are disfigured, it is all right to cover them more than that.</td>
<td><em>身披下衣</em>是將上邊緣環繞腰部，遮住肚臍，下邊緣遮住膝蓋骨，此稱為遮蓋「三圈」。《義註》中說，站立時，下邊緣不應超過膝蓋以下八指寬，但如果小腿畸形，可以遮蓋得更寬。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>To wear the upper robe wrapped around</em> means, according to the Vibhaṅga, keeping both ends of the top edge in line with each other, and the same with both ends of the bottom edge. The bottom edge of the upper robe, though, does not have to be level with the bottom edge of the lower robe. Given the size of the upper robe in the Buddha’s time, it would not have extended down that far.</td>
<td><em>身披上衣</em>，根據《經分別》，意指將上邊緣的兩端彼此對齊，下邊緣的兩端也一樣。但是，上衣的下邊緣不必與下衣的下邊緣齊平。考慮到佛陀時代的上衣尺寸，它不會垂到那麼低的位置。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Intentionally to wear either robe hanging down in front or in back is a breach of these rules. The Commentary states that the purpose of these rules is to prevent bhikkhus from wearing their robes in any of the various ways that lay people in those days wore theirs—e.g., pleated “with 100 pleats,” tied up, or tucked up between the legs. It also comments that because these rules are not qualified, as the following ones are, with the phrase, “in inhabited areas,” they should be followed in the monastery and wilderness areas as well. However, the wilderness protocols (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.6.2-3">Cv.VIII.6.2-3</a>) clearly show that bhikkhus were not expected to wear the upper robe wrapped around them in the wilderness; and the sauna protocols (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0040.html#Cv.VIII.8.2">Cv.VIII.8.2</a>) seem to indicate that bhikkhus on their way to and from the sauna were not required to wear their lower robes covering the three circles as long as they covered their private parts front and back.</td>
<td>故意將任一件袈裟垂於身前或身後均違反了這些戒條。《義註》指出，這些戒條的目的是防止比丘以當時在家人的各種方式穿著袈裟，例如，將「打一百個褶」、綁起來，或塞在兩腿之間。它也指出，由於這些戒條不像接下來的戒條那樣附加「俗家間」的措辭限定，因此在寺院和林野也應遵守。然而，林野行儀（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0296a08">《小品》.八.6.2-3</a>）明確表明，比丘在林野中無需身披上衣；蒸汽(桑拿)浴室的行儀（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0300a01">《小品》.八.8.2</a>）似乎也表明，比丘在往返桑拿房的途中，穿下衣時只要遮蓋住前後私處，不必遮蓋三圈。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As a practical matter, if one is working on a high ladder or in a tree—whether in a village, a monastery, or the wilderness—a wise policy is to tuck one’s lower robe up between the legs for decency’s sake.</td>
<td>從實際角度來說，如果在高高的梯子上或樹上工作——無論是在村莊、寺廟還是林野——明智之舉是出於禮貌，將下衣塞到兩腿之間。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga does not define <em>inhabited areas</em> in this or any of the following rules. The term thus probably has the same meaning as under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0025.html#Pd1">Pd 1</a>: in the homes of lay people, or along the streets and alleys of villages, cities, or towns. This does not include, however, monasteries located in inhabited areas, for the incoming bhikkhu’s protocols (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0048.html#Cv.VIII.1.2-5">Cv.VIII.1.2</a>) show that when the Canon was composed, bhikkhus were not required to wear their upper robes in the monastery. At present, though, many monasteries located in inhabited areas require that bhikkhus living with them observe many of these rules when outside of their personal quarters but still within monastery grounds.</td>
<td>《經分別》在本戒條及以下任何一條戒條中均未對「<em>俗家</em>」進行定義。因此，該術語的含義可能與<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0025/#Pd1">《應悔過》一</a>中的含義相同：即在家人的家中，或村莊、城市或城鎮的街道和小巷。然而，這並不包括位於俗家區域的寺院，因為客住比丘的行儀（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N04n0002_018/#0285a14">《小品》.八.1.2</a>）表明，在《聖典》編纂之時，比丘在寺院內無需穿著上衣。但如今，許多位於俗家區域的寺院要求與其同住的比丘們在離開個人住所但仍在寺院範圍內時，遵守其中許多戒條。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Well-covered</em>, according to the Commentary, means not exposing one’s chest or knees. One should have the upper edge of the upper robe around the neck, and the lower edge covering the wrists. The lower edge of the lower robe, as stated above, should cover the knees. When seated, only one’s head, hands, and legs from the calves on down should show.</td>
<td><em>善披覆</em>，根據《義註》，意指不露出胸部和膝蓋。上衣的上緣應圍繞頸部，下緣應遮住手腕。如上所述，下衣的下緣應遮住膝蓋。坐著時，只露出頭部、雙手和小腿以下的部分。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Sk 4 here has an added non-offense clause: There is no offense if one sits not “well-covered” within one’s residence (§). According to the Vinaya-mukha, this means within one’s room when staying overnight in a lay person’s home; when outside of one’s room, though, one should follow the rule.</td>
<td>《應學》四在此增加了一條不犯條款：如果在自己的住所內（§）坐著時沒有「善披覆」並不犯戒。根據《戒律入口》的解釋，這指的是在在家人的家中過夜時，在自己的房間裡；但如果在房間外，則應遵守此戒條。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga says that a bhikkhu should keep his gaze lowered to the ground the distance of a plow’s length ahead of him—this equals two meters, according to the Commentary. The purpose of this rule, it adds, is to prevent one from gazing aimlessly at the sights here and there as one walks along. There is nothing wrong, though, in looking up when one has reason to do so. An example given in the Commentary is stopping to look up and see if there are dangers from approaching horses or elephants. A more modern example would be checking the traffic before crossing a road.</td>
<td>《經分別》說，比丘應將目光向下，看向前方一犁長的距離的地面——根據《義註》，這相當於兩公尺。它補充說，這條戒條的目的是為了防止比丘在行走時漫無目的地四處張望。然而，有理由時抬頭看也無妨。《義註》中舉例說，停下來抬頭看看是否有靠近的馬匹或大象的危險。一個更現代的例子是，過馬路前先查看交通狀況。</td>
