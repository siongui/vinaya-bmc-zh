<tr><td>This training rule is corollary to the preceding one. Other religions at the Buddha’s time observed the formalities of receiving food from their lay followers just as the bhikkhus did, and thus a bhikkhu who gave food in such a way to a mendicant ordained in another religion would be placing himself in the position of a lay follower of that religion, as the second origin story shows. An interesting point about this rule is that the Buddha formulated it at the request of Buddhist lay followers. Having overheard the naked ascetics’ conversation, they said to him, “Venerable sir, these adherents of other religions enjoy criticizing the Buddha… Dhamma… and Saṅgha. It would be good if the masters did not give to adherents of other religions with their own hands.”</td>
<td>這條戒條與前一條戒條相輔相成。在佛陀時代，其他宗教也像比丘一樣，遵守著接受他們在家信眾食物的禮儀。因此，如果比丘以這種方式向其他宗教的托缽僧給予食物，就等於將自己置於該宗教的在家信眾的地位，正如第二個起源故事所示。這條戒條的一個有趣之處在於，佛陀是應佛教在家信眾的要求而制定的。他們無意中聽到裸行者的談話，便對佛陀說：「世尊，這些外教信徒喜歡批評佛……法……僧。如果大德們不親手將食物給予外教信徒就好了。」</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines the terms <em>naked ascetic</em> and <em>male or female wanderer</em> in such a way that they cover all people who have “gone forth” except for bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, female trainees, and male or female novices. Because “going forth” was how ordination was understood at that time, we can use the Great Standards at present to include anyone ordained in other religions—e.g., Catholic priests, Protestant ministers, Jewish rabbis, Muslim mullahs, etc.—under the factor of object here as well. Different Communities differ as to whether they would include people ordained in other Buddhist religions—such as Zen priests or Tibetan lamas—under this category as well.</td>
<td>《經分別》對<em>裸行者</em>和<em>男女遊方者</em>的定義，涵蓋了除比丘、比丘尼、學法女（式叉摩那）以及男女沙彌之外的所有「出家」者。由於「出家」是當時對受戒的理解，我們如今可以運用《四大教示》，將其他宗教出家者（例如天主教神父、新教牧師、猶太教拉比、穆斯林毛拉等）也納入此處的對象因素。不同的僧團對於是否將其他佛教出家者（例如禪宗僧人或西藏喇嘛）納入此類也存在分歧。</td>

In other words, a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. An unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa if one perceives him as a bhikkhu, if one perceives him as an unordained person, or if one is in doubt about the matter. <em>This pattern—three pācittiyas and three dukkaṭas—is repeated in all the rules where a bhikkhu is grounds for a pācittiya, an unordained person is grounds for a dukkaṭa, and perception is not a mitigating factor.</em></td>

The wife senses that her husband wants to have sexual intercourse with her and so—as a game, apparently—keeps detaining Ven. Upananda until the husband gets exasperated and goes to complain to the bhikkhus: “Venerable sirs, this master Upananda is sitting in the bedroom with my wife.

<tr><td>A family “with its meal.” This term—<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>—appears to be a pun in the original Pali, meaning either “with its meal”—<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>—or “with two people”—<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>. The Vibhaṅga explains it as a euphemism meaning “a man and woman together, both not having gone out (of their bedroom), not both without lust.” As its further explanations show, this means a man and woman together in their private quarters, with at least one of them desiring sexual intercourse with the other. Although the Commentary tries to justify the Vibhaṅga’s explanation etymologically (<em>bhoga</em>, the root form of meal, has other forms meaning enjoyment, indulgence, and use), there is no need to turn to etymology. Since ancient times in all cultures, eating has been commonly used as a metaphor for sex. (Similarly, the husband’s comment that he “has much work to do” could also be taken as a double entendre.)</td>
<td>一個家庭「與其餐食」。「<em>sabhojanaṁ</em>」一詞在原本巴利語中似乎是雙關語，意為「與其餐食」——<em>sa</em> + <em>bhojanaṁ</em>——或「與兩個人」——<em>sa</em> + <em>ubho</em> + <em>janaṁ</em>。《經分別》將其解釋為一種委婉說法，意為「一男一女在一起，兩人均未出（他們的臥室），並非雙方都無情欲」。進一步的解釋表明，這意味著一男一女在私人住處，至少其中一人渴望與另一人發生性關係。儘管《義註》試圖從字源學角度論證《經分別》的解釋（<em>bhoga</em>，餐食的字根，還有其他形式，意為享受、放縱和使用），但無需追溯詞源。自古以來，在所有文化中，「吃」就普遍被用作性的隱喻。（同樣，丈夫說他「有很多工作要做」也可以理解為（含情欲的）雙關語。）</td>

<tr><td>To <em>sit intruding</em> means to sit—without another bhikkhu present—in the private area of the house, this being defined in terms of how large the house is. In one large enough to have a separate bedroom, the private area is any spot more than one hatthapāsa (1.25 meters) in from the doorway (of the bedroom, says the Commentary). In a smaller house, the private area is the back half of the house. None of the texts discuss such things as one-room apartments or hotel rooms, but these would probably be treated as “separate bedrooms.”</td>
<td><em>坐著並打擾</em>是指在沒有其他比丘在場的情況下，坐在房屋的私人區域內。私人區域的定義取決於房屋的大小。在一間大到可以設有獨立臥室的房屋中，私人區域是指距離（《義註》中說是臥室的）門口超過一個 hatthapāsa （1.25米）的任何位置。在較小的房屋中，私人區域是指房屋的後半部。所有文獻均未討論單房間公寓或飯店房間之類的情況，但這些可能被視為「獨立臥室」。</td>

Thus, to be perfectly safe from an offense in cases like this, a bhikkhu should not sit intruding on a couple unless they both make him 100% certain that he is welcome: a wise policy in any case, regardless of whether one is a bhikkhu.</td>

<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha provides a third interpretation, defining “not aiming at privacy” with the following illustration: A bhikkhu is sitting in a secluded place with a man and woman present, but the man gets up and leaves before the bhikkhu can stop him. In other words, the bhikkhu is not intending to sit alone in private with the woman at all, but circumstances beyond his control force him to.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》提供了第三種解釋，用以下例子來定義「不為了隱私」：一位比丘與一男一女坐在僻靜之處，但比丘還沒來得及阻止，那位男士就起身離開了。換句話說，比丘根本並不想與那位女士單獨坐在一起，但他無法控制的情況迫使他不得不如此。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the first interpretation, because it adheres most closely to the wording in the Vibhaṅga, is probably the correct one here, the Vinaya-mukha’s is probably the safest, and many Communities adhere to it with good reason. Both the Canon and the Commentary give frequent warnings about the dangers that can arise when a bhikkhu sits alone with a woman even when his original intention is innocent. His own defilements may eventually tempt him to do, say, or think things that are detrimental to his resolve in the celibate life; and even when his motives are pure, he is inviting the suspicions of others. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a> requires that if a trustworthy outside witness is suspicious of a bhikkhu’s sitting alone with a woman—and unless he is sitting with his mother or other elderly relative, it’s rare that outsiders won’t be suspicious—the Community must meet to investigate the issue. Even though they may find him innocent of any wrong doing, the fact that they have had to investigate his behavior is usually enough to keep suspicions alive among the laity and to create resentment among his fellow bhikkhus over the waste of their time due to his indiscretion. At the same time, a bhikkhu sitting alone with a woman is leaving himself at the mercy of the woman, who will later be free to make any claims she likes about what went on while they were alone together. As Lady Visākhā said in the origin story to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0012.html#Ay1">Ay 1</a>, “It is unfitting and improper, venerable sir, for the master to sit in private, alone with a woman…. Even though the master may not be aiming at that act, cynical people are hard to convince.”</td>
<td>雖然第一種解釋，因為它與《經分別》的措辭最為接近，在此可能是正確的，但《戒律入口》的解釋可能是最安全的，許多僧團也有充分的理由遵循它。《聖典》和《義註》都多次警告比丘，即使他的初衷是無辜的，與女人獨坐也會產生危險。他自身的煩惱最終可能會誘使他做出、說出或思考一些有損於他梵行生活決心的事情；即使他的動機是純潔的，他也會引起他人的懷疑。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>規定，如果一個值得信賴的外部目擊者懷疑比丘與女人獨坐——除非他與母親或其他年長的親戚坐在一起，否則外人很少不會起疑心——僧團必須開會調查此事。即使他們可能認定他無辜沒有做錯，但必須調查他的行為本身這件事實通常足以在俗人中引起懷疑，並激起他的比丘同儕們的不滿，因為他的輕率行為浪費了他們的時間。同時，比丘與女子獨坐，等於任由女子擺佈，而女子日後可以隨意對他們獨處時發生的事情做出任何她想要的聲稱。正如毘舍佉鹿子母在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0012/#Ay1">《不定》一</a>的起源故事時所說：「大德，大師與女子獨坐，是不得體且不恰當的……即使大師並非有意為之，憤世嫉俗的人也很難被說服。」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus the wise policy would be to be no less strict than one’s Community in interpreting this factor.</td>
<td>因此，明智之舉是在解釋這一因素時，其嚴格程度不低於其所在僧團的嚴格程度。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Non-offenses</strong></td>
<td><strong>不犯</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In addition to the bhikkhu not aiming at privacy, there is no offense for the bhikkhu who sits alone with a woman when his attention is elsewhere—e.g., he is absorbed in his work or his meditation when a woman comes in and sits down in the room where he is sitting. Also, there is no offense if either the bhikkhu or the woman or both are standing, or if both are sitting when a knowledgeable man is present.</td>
<td>除了比丘不為了隱私之外，如果比丘與女子獨坐時注意力在別處，例如，他正專心工作或禪修，有位女子走進他所坐的房間裡坐下，這並無犯戒。此外，如果比丘或女子，或兩人都站著，或者兩人都坐著，而且有一位博學的男士在場，這同樣也無犯戒。</td>

<tr><td>As for the question of how to determine whether another bhikkhu is or is not available, the Commentary draws the distinction like this: After the desire to go calling on families arises in one’s mind and one takes a normal path to leave the monastery, if one comes across a bhikkhu who is close enough to address in a normal tone of voice (within six meters, says the Sub-commentary), that means that a bhikkhu is available and one should inform him of where one is going. If one does not come across a bhikkhu that close, no bhikkhu is available, and there is no need to go out of one’s way to find one.</td>
<td>至於如何判斷是否有比丘在或不在，《義註》是這樣區分的：當心生走訪俗家的願望，並沿著正常的路徑離開寺院後，如果遇到一位距離足夠近、可以用正常語氣講話的比丘（《複註》中說，距離在六米以內），則代表有比丘在，應告知其去向。如果在這麼近的地方沒有遇到比丘，則表示沒有比丘在，無需特意去找。</td>

<td>但這與《經分別》中「在」的定義直接矛盾——「告別後可以離開」——也就是說，如果寺院裡有另一位比丘，而向他告別沒有任何障礙（例如，他睡著了，他生病了，他正在接待重要訪客），那麼就有義務去通知他。</td>

<tr><td>According to the K/Commentary, <em>taking leave</em> in the context of this rule means the simple act of informing the other bhikkhu that, “I am going to the house of so-and-so,” or any similar statement.

However, if the other bhikkhu sees that one is doing something improper in going, he is perfectly free to say so. If one treats his comments with disrespect, one incurs at least a dukkaṭa under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0021.html#Pc54">Pc 54</a>. (See the discussion under that rule for details.)</td>

<tr><td>For a new bhikkhu still living in dependence <em>(nissaya)</em> on his mentor, though, taking leave <em>is</em> a matter of asking permission at all times, whether one has been invited to a meal or not. The Mahāvagga (I.25.24; II.21.1) states that one of the duties of such a bhikkhu is that he must receive permission from his mentor before entering a village, going to a cemetery, or leaving the district. Not to ask permission before going, or to go after being denied permission, is to incur a dukkaṭa. As for the mentor, if he gives permission to go when it is not appropriate to do so, <em>he</em> is the one who incurs the dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>然而，對於仍依止<em>（nissaya）</em>導師生活的新出家比丘來說，無論是否受邀請赴餐食，每次離開<em>都</em>需先行請求導師的允許。《大品》（<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_001/#0067a04">一.25.24</a>；<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/yht-tipitaka/extra/tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/N03n0002_002/#0157a10">二.21.1</a>）規定，這類比丘的義務之一是，在進入村莊、前往墓地或離開所在地區之前，必須獲得導師的許可。未經許可前往，或被拒絕後仍前往，均會犯《突吉羅》。至於導師，如果在不合適的情況下允許前往，<em>他</em>自己犯《突吉羅》。</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in conjunction with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">Pc 85</a>, is designed to keep bhikkhus from visiting lay people and spending their time in inappropriate ways. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">Pc 85</a> deals with entire villages and towns, and covers the act of leaving the monastery during the period from noon until the following dawnrise. This rule deals with family residences and covers the act of leaving the monastery during the period from dawnrise until noon on days when one has been invited to a meal. The period from dawnrise to noon on days when one is not invited to a meal, and would be expected to go on alms round, is thus not covered by either rule. Note, however, that in the origin story to this rule the Buddha reprimands Ven. Upananda for visiting families during the latter part of a morning after going for alms. This shows that he did not approve of such behavior even though he had practical reasons for not laying down a rule against it: On mornings when one is going for alms—and in his time, alms-going could often be an all-morning affair—there is no convenient way to draw a hard and fast line between appropriate alms-going and inappropriate visiting. Thus we have the rules as they stand. At present, though, in monasteries where alms-going takes up much less of the morning or where the bhikkhus do not go outside the monastery for alms at all, a wise policy is to adhere to the general principle by informing a fellow bhikkhu whenever possible when one is leaving the monastery for errands or visits involving lay people, even during periods not covered by the rules.</td>
<td>這條戒條，結合<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">《波逸提》八五</a>，旨在防止比丘拜訪俗人並以不適當的方式度過他們的時間。<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0024.html#Pc85">《波逸提》八五</a>涉及整個村莊和城鎮，並涵蓋從中午到第二天黎明之前的時間段離開寺院的行為。這條戒條涉及俗家住處，涵蓋在被邀請赴餐食的日子裡從黎明到中午的時間段離開寺院的行為。因此，在沒有被邀請赴餐食而應該去托缽的日子裡，從黎明到中午的時間段不在這兩條戒條的範圍內。但請注意，在本戒條的起源故事中，佛陀斥責了優跋難陀尊者，因為他在托缽後於上午的後半段拜訪俗家。這表明他不贊成這種行為，儘管他有不制定禁止戒條的實際原因：在去托缽的上午——在他的時代，托缽往往是一整個上午的事情——沒有方便的方法來在適當的托缽和不適當的拜訪之間劃出一條嚴格的界限。因此，我們有了現在的戒條。然而，目前，在托缽佔用早上時間很少或比丘根本不出寺院托缽的寺院中，一個明智之舉是遵守一般原則，盡可能在離開寺院辦事或牽涉俗人的拜訪時通知同儕比丘，即使是在戒條未涵蓋的時間段。</td>

<tr><td>Three of the non-offense clauses require no explanation: There is no offense in asking from relatives, for the sake of another, or for medicine to be bought with one’s own resources.</td>
<td>其中三項不犯條款無需解釋：向親戚要求、為他人要求、用自己的資源購買藥物均不犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One of the two non-offense clauses requiring explanation is that there is no offense in asking “from those by whom one was invited with medicine.” This the Commentary explains by saying that if one has received a personal invitation, one may ask in line with its terms, but that otherwise the limits set by this rule apply only to invitations made to an entire Community and not to those made on a personal basis to individual bhikkhus. Although the Vibhaṅga makes no specific mention of this point, the Commentary’s explanation seems the best way to make sense of this non-offense clause and the relationship between this rule and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0019.html#Pc39">Pc 39</a>. Under that rule, a bhikkhu who is not ill and has not been invited incurs a dukkaṭa in asking for any one of the five tonics, and there seems no reason to impose a heavier penalty for requesting one of the five tonics after a personal invitation to do so has expired. If, though, the invitation referred to in this rule is one made to an entire Community, the heavier penalty makes sense as an added protection to the donor against having his/her invitation abused by the less conscientious members of the Community. This added protection would also be a means of encouraging further invitations of this sort in the future.</td>
<td>需要解釋的兩條不犯條款之一是，「向邀請自己藥物的人」要求並無犯戒。《義註》對此的解釋是，如果收到了個人邀請，則可以按照其條款提出要求，但除此之外，此戒條的限制僅適用於向整個僧團發出的邀請，而不適用於基於個人向個別比丘發出的邀請。雖然《經分別》沒有具體提及這一點，但《義註》的解釋似乎是理解此不犯條款以及此戒條與<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0019/#Pc39">《波逸提》三九</a>之間關係的最佳方式。根據該戒條，無病且未被邀請的比丘在要求五種補品中的任何一種時犯《突吉羅》，並且似乎沒有理由對在個人邀請過期後請求五種補品之一施加更重的懲罰。然而，如果本戒條中提到的邀請是向整個僧團發出的，那麼更重的懲罰是合理的，因為它可以為布施者提供額外的保護，防止其邀請被僧團中不太負責任的成員濫用。這種額外的保護也有助於鼓勵未來繼續進行此類邀請。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The second non-offense clause requiring explanation is the one for an ill bhikkhu. Reading the rule, one might imagine that the exemption for an ill bhikkhu would read simply, “There is no offense if one is ill,” but instead it reads, “There is no offense if one says, ‘The time period for which we were invited has passed, but we have need of medicine.’” This is an important point of etiquette. Normally, an ill bhikkhu may ask anyone for medicine at any time, but in dealing with a person who has made an invitation for medicine to the Community, he has to show special consideration. In mentioning the fact that the time period for the invitation has expired, he gives recognition of the fact that the donor is no longer under any obligation to provide the medicine, thus giving the donor a convenient “out” in case he/she can no longer provide it. This simple gesture is the least consideration that can be shown to someone who has had the generosity to invite the Community to ask for medicines. And again, simple gestures of this sort help to protect donors and encourage similar invitations again in the future.</td>
<td>第二個需要解釋的不犯條款是關於生病比丘的。閱讀這條戒條，可能會以為，對生病比丘的豁免條款可簡單地拼讀成「如果生病，就沒有犯戒」，但實際上卻是「如果說『我們被邀請的期限已過，但我們需要藥物』，則沒有犯戒。」這是威儀中的一個重要方面。通常，生病的比丘可以隨時向任何人要求藥物，但在對待邀請僧團索取藥物的人時，他必須表現出特殊的體諒。在提到邀請期限已過這一事實時，他承認了布施者不再有提供藥物的義務，從而為布施者在無法再提供藥物時提供了一個方便的「藉口」。這個簡單的舉動，是對慷慨邀請僧團索取藥物的人所能表現出的最低限度的體諒。再次強調，這種簡單的舉動有助於保護布施者，並鼓勵未來再次發出類似的邀請。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although this last non-offense clause applies explicitly only to an invitation specifying the time period, the Great Standards could be used to apply it to an invitation specifying requisites as well. In other words, an ill bhikkhu could say, “You invited the Community with honey, but I have need of ghee.”</td>
<td>雖然最後這條不犯條款明確僅適用於指定時段的邀請，但可用《四大教示》來將此不犯條款也適用於指定必需品的邀請。換句話說，一位生病的比丘可以說：「你用蜂蜜邀請僧團，但我需要酥油。」</td>

<tr><td><strong>An alternative interpretation</strong></td>
<td><strong>另一種解釋</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha tries to extend this rule to cover invitations of every sort, individual and communal, dealing with any sort of requisite. It also reads the training rule to mean that if a time limit is not specified on an invitation, a four-month time limit is to be assumed. All of this has no support in the Vibhaṅga and so is not binding, but the last point is something that individual bhikkhus may adopt as a personal policy to teach themselves moderation in their requests. A donor’s faith and financial position can change quickly, and it is reasonable not to depend on an invitation for longer periods of time unless the donor makes it clear that he/she is still willing to continue providing the item offered on a long-term basis.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》試圖將此戒條擴展至涵蓋各種形式的邀請，無論是個人邀請還是集體邀請，以及處理任何種類的必需品。它還將本戒條解讀成，如果邀請未註明期限，則視為四個月的期限。所有這些在《經分別》中均無依據，因此不具有約束力，但最後一點是比丘們可以作為個人準則，以學習在請求時保持節制。布施者的信心和經濟狀況可以快速地轉變，因此，除非布施者明確表示願意長期繼續供養物品，否則不依賴長期邀請是合理的。</td>
