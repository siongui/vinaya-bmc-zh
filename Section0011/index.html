<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>這個術語的意思是「讓僧團參與初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和後續 <em>(sesa)</em> 行為」。它源於這樣一個事實，即僧團是最初要求違反此類戒條的比丘接受懲罰（ <em>mānatta</em> ，贖罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，別住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他沒有正確執行，則隨後重新施加懲罰，最終當他正確執行後解除懲罰。此處有十三個學處（訓練戒條），前九個在違反時即犯《僧殘》，最後四個只有在違反者作為僧伽羯磨的一部分被訶責三次之後才犯《僧殘》。</td>

<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">爾時，施越尊者過著不滿的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形體枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脈悉現。優陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。一見到他，就對他說：『友！施越！，你為什麼形體枯瘦…筋脈悉現？難道你對梵行生活不滿意？』</td>

<tr><td>“‘In that case, eat as you like and sleep as you like and bathe as you like; and having eaten, slept, and bathed as you like, when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails the mind, emit semen having attacked (!) with your hand.’</td>
<td>「『既然如此，想吃就吃，想睡就睡，想沐浴就沐浴；隨心所欲地飲食、睡眠、沐浴，當不滿生起、欲念侵襲心時，就用手攻擊（！）射出精液。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘But is it okay to do that?’</td>
<td>「『但是這樣做可以嗎？』</td>

<tr><td>“‘Of course. I do it myself.’</td>

<tr><td>“So then Ven. Seyyasaka ate as he liked and slept as he liked… and when dissatisfaction arose and lust assailed his mind, he would emit semen having attacked with his hand. Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「於是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，他就會用手攻擊射出精液。然後沒多久，他就變得很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。因此，他的朋友比丘們對他說：『以前，朋友施越，你形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。但現在的你很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。難道是你在吃藥？』</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒條的大綱形式是最容易解釋的戒條之一。然而，就其細節而言，它是最複雜的之一，不僅因為該主題是一個敏感問題，而且因為《義註》在對構成完整違犯的三個因素中的兩個的解釋中偏離了《經分別》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>這三個因素是結果、意圖和努力：由於有意的努力而導致精液的排出。當這三個因素都存在時，該違犯就是《僧殘》。如果最後兩項——意圖和努力——都存在，那麼該違犯就是《偷蘭遮》。任何單一因素或兩個因素的任何其他組合——即沒有做出肉體的努力的意圖和結果，或沒有意圖的努力和結果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出結果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解釋一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒條所涵蓋的意圖和努力類型時，有必要知道它們的目的是什麼，也因為結果是《經分別》和《義註》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<td><strong>結果</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，精液有十種顏色，這種分類源自古印度醫學的診斷實踐，醫生會檢查男性患者的射精，以此作為診斷其健康狀況的一種方式。在根據這十種顏色的精液提出了一長系列的輪子之後，《經分別》得出了一個簡單的結論：精液的顏色和品質與犯戒無關。這表明，接受過輸精管結紮手術的比丘仍然可以犯下這條戒條，因為他仍然可以在性高潮時排出進入精液的各種成分（僅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>儘管《經分別》補充說，當精液「從基底落下」時，精液就會被排出，但它並沒有詳細討論這一點。關於這種情況在性刺激過程中何時發生，《義註》討論了三種觀點。儘管它的討論是以當時所理解的射精生理學為框架的，但它的結論很明確：當「使整個身體搖晃時，它被釋放並下降到尿道」時，精液從其基底移動—換句話說，在性高潮的時候。《義註》進一步解釋說，精液在進入尿道時會從其基底落下，因為從那時起，該過程是不可逆轉的。因此，如果性刺激的過程達到了這一點，即使在性高潮時試圖透過捏住陰莖末端來阻止精液離開身體，結果因素也已經滿足。一旦進入尿道，它就已經從基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否離開身體並不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>儘管一些《複註》的再註釋提出了比《義註》更謹慎的觀點，即當射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺產生少量透明鹼性液體時，精液就被視為從其基底落下。《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明《義註》是錯誤的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Intention</strong></td>
<td><strong>意圖</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” The Commentary explains these terms as follows: <em>Having willed</em> means having willed, having planned, with the intention of enjoying bringing about an emission. <em>Having made the decision</em> means having summoned up a reckless mind state, “crushing” through the power of an attack. (These are the same terms it uses to explain the same phrase under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">Pc 61</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">Pc 77</a>. The meaning is that one is not simply toying with the idea. One has definitely made up one’s mind to overcome all hesitation by aggressively setting upon an action aimed at causing emission.) <em>Knowingly</em> means knowing that, “I am making an exertion”—which the Sub-commentary explains as knowing that, “I am making an exertion for the sake of an emission.” <em>Consciously</em> means being aware that one’s efforts are bringing about an emission of semen.</td>
<td>《經分別》將<em>故意</em>定義為「有意願，明知地而且有意識地做出決定」。《義註》對這些術語的解釋如下：<em>有意願</em>，意思是已經願意、已經計劃、並且意圖享受射精。<em>做出決定</em>，意思是喚起了不顧後果的精神狀態，以攻擊之力「碾碎」。（這些是它用來解釋<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr3">《波羅夷》三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">《波逸提》六一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">《波逸提》七七</a>中相同措辭的相同術語。意思是，不僅玩弄這個想法。而是已經肯定地下定決心，克服所有猶豫，積極地採取旨在引起射精的行動。）<em>明知</em>意思是知道「我正在努力」——《複註》將其解釋為知道「我正在為了射精而努力」。<em>有意識</em>意思是意識到自己的努力正在導致精液的排出。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of “having willed” is where it deviates from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of intention. The Vibhaṅga, throughout its analysis, expresses this factor simply as “aiming at causing an emission,” and it lists ten possible motives for wanting to bring the emission about:</td>

<tr><td>Each of these motives, the Vibhaṅga says, fulfills the factor of intention here. Thus for the Commentary to limit the question of “deliberate intention” strictly to the enjoyment of the act of bringing about an emission (numbers 2 and 10 in the Vibhaṅga’s list) has no basis in the Canon. This means that the factor of intention under this rule is defined by deliberateness and immediate aim—causing an emission of semen—regardless of impulse or motive.</td>
<td>《經分別》說，這些動機中的每一個都滿足了這裡的意圖因素。因此，《義註》將「故意」問題嚴格限制為享受帶來射精的行為（《經分別》列表中的第2和10號）在《聖典》中是沒有根據的。這意味著本戒條下的意圖因素是由故意和直接目標（導致精液排出）定義的，無論衝動或動機如何。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines four types of effort that fulfill this factor: A bhikkhu causes an emission making an effort (1) at an internal object, (2) at an external object, (3) at both an internal and an external object, or (4) by shaking his pelvis in the air. It then goes on to explain these terms: The internal object is one’s own living body. External objects can either be animate or inanimate objects. The third type of effort involves a combination of the first two, and the fourth covers cases when one makes one’s penis erect (“workable”) by making an effort in the air.</td>
<td>《經分別》定義了滿足此因素的四種類型的努力：比丘造成射精藉由努力於：（1）內在所緣，（2）外在所緣，（3）內在所緣和外在所緣，或（4）透過在空中搖動骨盆。然後它繼續解釋這些術語：內在所緣是一個人自己的生命體。外在所緣可以是有生命的或無生命的所緣。第三種類型的努力涉及前兩種的組合，第四種涵蓋了透過在空中努力使陰莖勃起（「可行」）的情況。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The extremely general nature of these definitions gives the impression that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga wanted them to cover every imaginable type of bodily effort aimed at arousing oneself sexually, and this impression is borne out by the wide variety of cases covered in the Vinīta-vatthu. They include, among others, a bhikkhu who squeezes his penis with his fist, one who rubs his penis with his thumb, one who rubs his penis against his bed, one who inserts his penis into sand, one who bathes against the current in a stream, one who rubs his preceptor’s back in the bathing room, one who gets an erection from the friction of his thighs and robes while walking along, one who has his belly heated in the bathing room, and one who stretches his body. In each of these cases, if the bhikkhu aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.</td>
<td>這些定義極其籠統的性質給人的印象是，《經分別》的編撰者希望它們涵蓋所有可以想像到的旨在喚起性欲的身體努力類型，而這種印象在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中涵蓋的各種案例中得到了證實。其中包括一位比丘用拳頭擠壓他的陰莖，一位比丘用拇指摩擦他的陰莖，一位比丘用床摩擦他的陰莖，一位將他的陰莖插入沙子中，一位<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a08">在水流中逆流沐浴</a>。一位是在浴房裡摩擦戒師的背部，一位是走路時大腿和袈裟摩擦而勃起的，一位是在浴房裡加熱腹部的，一位是伸展身體的。在上述每一種情況下，如果比丘目的在於射精並成功，他就會犯《僧殘》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu also includes a case in which a bhikkhu, desiring to cause an emission, orders a novice to take hold of his (the bhikkhu’s) penis. He gets his emission and a saṅghādisesa to boot, which shows that getting someone else to make the effort for one fulfills the factor of effort here. Under the factor of consent, below, we will discuss a similar case from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> which indicates that simply lying still while allowing someone else to bring one to an orgasm fulfills the factor of effort here as well.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》還包括一個例子，一位比丘想要射精，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0163a07">命令一位沙彌抓住他的（比丘的）陰莖</a>。他得到了他的射精和《僧殘》，這表明讓別人為自己付出努力就滿足了這裡的努力因素。在下面的同意因素下，我們將討論從<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的一個類似案例，該案例表明，僅僅只是不動地躺著，同時允許別人使自己達到高潮，也滿足了這裡的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the factor of effort, though, the Commentary adds an additional sub-factor: that the effort must be directed at one’s own penis. If this were so, then a bhikkhu who succeeded in causing an emission by stimulating any of the erogenous zones of his body aside from his penis would incur no penalty. The Commentary itself actually makes this point, and the Sub-commentary seconds it, although the V/Sub-commentary says that such a bhikkhu would incur a dukkaṭa—what it bases this opinion on, it doesn’t say: perhaps a misreading of the Case of the Sleeping Novice, which we will discuss below.</td>
<td>然而，在討論努力因素時，《義註》增加了一個額外的子因素：努力必須針對自己的陰莖。如果是這樣的話，那麼比丘如果透過刺激身體上除陰莖以外的任何性感帶而成功地導致射精，就不會受到懲罰。《義註》本身實際上提出了這一點，而《複註》也同意這一點，儘管V/《複註》說這樣的比丘會犯《突吉羅》—它並沒有說明此觀點基於什麼：也許是對<strong>睡眠沙彌案例</strong>的誤讀，我們將在下面討論。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, the Commentary in adding this last factor runs up against a number of cases in the Vinīta-vatthu in which the effort does not involve the penis: the bhikkhu warming his belly, the bhikkhu rubbing his preceptor’s back, a bhikkhu having his thighs massaged, and others. The Commentary deals with these cases by rewriting them, stating in most cases that the effort somehow had to involve the penis. This in itself is questionable, but when the Commentary actually contradicts the Vinīta-vatthu in the case of the bhikkhu who warms his belly, saying that this sort of effort could not involve an offense at all, even if one aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, the commentators have moved beyond the realm of commenting into the realm of rewriting the rule.</td>
<td>無論如何，《義註》在添加這最後一個因素時遭遇到了《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的許多案例，其中努力不涉及陰莖：比丘溫暖他的腹部，比丘摩擦他的戒師的背部，比丘讓他的大腿被按摩，等等。《義註》透過改寫來處理這些案例，指出在大多數情況下，努力必須以某種方式涉及陰莖。這本身是有問題的，但是當《義註》實際上與《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中比丘溫暖腹部的案例相矛盾時，說這種努力根本不涉及犯戒，即使一個人的目的在於射精並成功，註釋者已經超越了註釋領域，進入了改寫戒條的領域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As stated in the Introduction, we have to go on the assumption that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga knew the crucial factors of each offense well enough to know what is and is not an offense, and were careful enough to include all the relevant facts when describing the precedents in the Vinīta-vatthu in order to show how the Buddha arrived at his judgments. Because the Commentary’s position—adding the extra factor that the physical effort has to involve one’s own penis—directly contradicts the Vibhaṅga on this point, the extra factor cannot stand.</td>
<td>如同<strong>引言</strong>中所述，我們必須繼續假設，《經分別》的編纂者充分了解每種犯戒的關鍵因素，知道什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒，並且在描述《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的先例時足夠小心，包括所有相關事實，以表明佛陀如何得出他的判斷。因為《義註》的立場——增加了身體努力必須涉及自己的陰莖這一額外因素——在這一點上直接與《經分別》相矛盾，所以這個額外因素不能成立。</td>

<tr><td>“On that occasion a certain bhikkhu grabbed hold of the penis of a sleeping novice. His semen was emitted. He felt conscience-stricken…. ‘Bhikkhu, there is no saṅghādisesa offense. There is a dukkaṭa offense.’”</td>
<td>「有一次，某個比丘抓住了一個熟睡的沙彌的陰莖。他的精液被射出。他感到良心不安…。『比丘，非《僧殘》，乃《突吉羅》』」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The issue here is whose semen was emitted. Pali syntax, unlike English, doesn’t give us a clue, for there is no syntactical rule that the pronoun in one sentence should refer to the subject of the preceding sentence. There are many cases under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a> that follow the form, “A stone badly held by the bhikkhu standing above hit the bhikkhu standing below on the head. The bhikkhu died. He felt conscience-stricken.” In these cases it is obvious from the context within the story which bhikkhu died and which one felt conscience-stricken, while with the sleeping novice we have to look for the context in other parts of the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>這裡的問題是誰的精液被排出了。巴利語法與英語不同，沒有給我們任何線索，因為沒有語法規則要求一個句子中的代名詞應該指前一個句子的主詞。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr3">《波羅夷》三</a>中有許多案例遵循這樣的形式：「站在上面的比丘拙劣地握住一塊石頭，擊中了站在下面的比丘的頭部。比丘死了。他感到良心受到譴責。」在這些情況下，從故事的上下文中可以明顯看出哪個比丘死了，哪個比丘感到良心受到打擊，而對於睡眠的沙彌，我們必須在《經分別》的其他部分尋找上下文。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu was the one who emitted semen, then perhaps there is a contradiction in the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary is justified in saying that the effort must involve one’s penis, for otherwise the case would seem to fulfill the Vibhaṅga’s general definition for the factor of effort: The bhikkhu is making an effort at an outside body and has an emission. Following the general pattern of the rule, he would incur a saṅghādisesa if he intended emission, and no penalty at all if he didn’t. Yet—deviating from the standard pattern for the Vinīta-vatthu cases—the Buddha does not ask whether he aimed at emitting semen, and simply gives the bhikkhu a dukkaṭa, which suggests an inconsistency.</td>
<td>如果比丘是射出精液的人，那麼《經分別》中也許存在矛盾，而《義註》說努力必須涉及自己的陰莖是合理的，否則這種情況似乎滿足了《經分別》對努力因素的一般定義：比丘對對外部的身體施加努力並且射出精液。按照戒條的一般模式，如果他意圖射精，就會犯《僧殘》，如果他沒有意圖射精，則不會受到任何懲罰。然而，與《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例的標準模式不同的是，佛陀並沒有問他是否旨在射精，而只是給了比丘《突吉羅》，這表明了不一致。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, the novice was the one who emitted, there is no inconsistency at all: The bhikkhu incurs his dukkaṭa for making lustful bodily contact with another man (see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, below), and the case is included here to show that the full offense under this rule concerns instances where one makes <em>oneself</em> emit semen, and not where one makes others emit. (Other than this case, there is nothing in the rule or the Vibhaṅga that expressly makes this point. The rule simply mentions bringing about the emission of semen, without explicitly mentioning whose. This would explain the bhikkhu’s uncertainty as to whether or not he had committed a saṅghādisesa.) And the reason there is no mention of whether or not the bhikkhu intended to emit semen is because—as it comes under another rule—it is irrelevant to the case.</td>
<td>然而，如果沙彌是射出精液的人，則根本沒有矛盾：比丘因與另一個男人進行淫蕩的身體接觸而犯《突吉羅》（參見下面<a class="reference external" href="#Sg2">《僧殘》二</a>的討論），這個案例被包括在這裡，以顯示本戒條下的完全違犯涉及一個人使<em>自己</em>射出精液的情況，而不是使他人射出精液的情況。（除了這個例子之外，戒條或《經分別》中沒有任何內容明確說明這一點。戒條只是提到導致精液的排出，而沒有明確提及是誰的。這可以解釋比丘不確定自己是否犯《僧殘》。）之所以沒有提及比丘是否有意射精，是因為——它屬於另一條戒條——與本案例無關。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, inasmuch as the second reading—the novice was the one who had an emission—does no violence to the rest of the Vibhaṅga, it seems to be the preferable one. If this was the case that led the commentators to add their extra factor, we can see that they misread it and that the Vibhaṅga’s original definition for the factor of effort still stands: Any bodily effort made at one’s own body, at another body or physical object, at both, or any effort made in the air—like shaking one’s pelvis or stretching one’s body—fulfills the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>因此，由於第二種讀法——沙彌是射精的人——對《經分別》的其餘部分沒有衝突，所以它似乎是更好的讀法。如果正是這種情況導致註釋者添加他們的額外因素，我們可以看到他們誤讀了它，而《經分別》對努力因素的原始定義仍然有效：對自己的身體、對另一個身體或身體對象，或對兩者皆是，還是在空中所做的任何努力——比如搖動一個人的骨盆或伸展一個人的身體——所做出的任何身體努力，都滿足了這裡的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One case that does <em>not</em> fulfill the factor of effort, according to the Vinīta-vatthu, is when one is filled with lust and stares at the private parts of a woman or girl. In the case dealing with this contingency, the bhikkhu emits semen, but again the Buddha does not ask whether he intended to. Instead, he lays down a separate rule, imposing a dukkaṭa for staring lustfully at a woman’s private parts. This suggests that efforts with one’s eyes do not count as bodily efforts under this saṅghādisesa rule, for otherwise the penalty would have been a saṅghādisesa if the bhikkhu had intended emission, and no offense—not a dukkaṭa—if he hadn’t. And this also suggests that the dukkaṭa under this separate rule holds regardless of intention or result. The Commentary adds that this dukkaṭa applies also to staring lustfully at the genitals of a female animal or at the area of a fully-clothed woman’s body where her sexual organ is, thinking, “Her sexual organ is there.” At present we would impose the penalty on a bhikkhu who stares lustfully at a woman’s private parts in a pornographic photograph.</td>
<td>根據《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，一種<em>不</em>滿足努力因素的情況是，當一個人充滿欲望並盯著女人或女孩的私處時。在處理這種可能發生的情況時，比丘射出精液，但佛陀並沒有問他是否有意這樣做。相反地，他制定了一條單獨的戒條，對<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a02">充滿欲望地凝視女性私處，處以《突吉羅》</a>。這表明，在本《僧殘》戒條下，用眼睛做的努力不算作身體的努力，否則，如果比丘有意射精，就會受到《僧殘》的懲罰；如果他沒有無意，則沒有犯戒，而不是《突吉羅》。這也表明，無論意圖或結果如何，這條單獨戒條下的《突吉羅》都成立。《義註》補充說，這種《突吉羅》也適用於充滿欲望地凝視雌性動物的生殖器，或盯著穿著衣服的女性身體的性器官所在的區域，心想：「她的性器官就在那裡。」目前，我們會對在色情照片中充滿欲望地凝視女性私處的比丘施以此懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see under the non-offense clauses, there is no offense in a nocturnal emission. The Commentary, however, discusses the question of conscious efforts made prior to sleep aimed at a nocturnal emission, and arrives at the following verdicts: If a bhikkhu, “usurped” with lust while lying down, grabs his penis with his fist or thighs and drops off to sleep maintaining that position in hopes of inducing an emission, he incurs the full offense if the emission takes place. If, however, he suppresses his “lust-usurpation” by reflecting on the foulness of the body and then dozes off with a pure mind, he incurs no offense even if an emission later occurs. The analysis here seems to be that the bhikkhu’s change of mind would separate the emission from the earlier effort enough so that it would not be regarded as a direct result of that effort. The Sub-commentary adds that, in addition to suppressing the lust in his mind, he also has to discontinue his effort to be free of an offense in this way. And both texts have to be qualified by saying that the “no offense” would apply only to the emission, for the earlier intentional effort would incur a thullaccaya.</td>
<td>正如我們將在不犯條款中看到的，遺精並不構成犯戒。然而，《義註》討論了在睡眠前為了遺精而有意識地努力的問題，並得出以下結論：如果比丘在躺下時被欲望「侵占」，用拳頭或大腿抓住他的陰莖，入睡時保持該姿勢以期引起遺精，如果發生遺精，他將完全違犯此戒條。然而，如果他透過反思身體的不淨來抑制「欲望篡奪」，然後以清淨的心入睡，即使後來發生遺精，他也不會犯戒。這裡的分析似乎是，比丘改變心意，會將射精與先前的努力充分分開，這樣它就不會被視為該努力的直接結果。《複註》又說，除了抑制內心的欲望之外，他還必須停止他的努力而免於以這種方式犯戒。這兩篇文本都必須加以限定，即「不犯」僅適用於射精，因為更早之前的故意努力會犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>

In both cases the bhikkhu lets her go ahead, and the Buddha says that he incurs a saṅghādisesa in doing so. The commentaries treat the cases as self-evident and offer no extra details. Thus, given the facts as we have them, it would seem that consent under this rule can be expressed physically simply by letting the act happen. A bhikkhu who acquiesces mentally when someone tries and succeeds in making him emit semen is not absolved from the full offense here even if he otherwise lies perfectly still throughout the event.</td>

Otherwise, one would incur a thullaccaya simply for moving one’s legs. <em>Sensual fever</em>, here, probably refers to the desire to cause an emission, for there are several spots where the Commentary discusses bhikkhus who stimulate an erection simply for the enjoyment of the contact rather than to cause an emission, and the judgment is that they incur no penalty, even if an emission does inadvertently result.</td>
<td>在討論一位大腿肥大的比丘，只要走路就勃起的案例時，《義註》提到，如果在這種情況下發現欲「燒」，必須立即停止行走，並開始觀照身體的不淨，以便在繼續前進之前淨化內心。否則，僅僅因為移動雙腿就會招致《偷蘭遮》。這裡的<em>欲燒</em>可能是指想要引起射精的欲望，因為《義註》中有好幾處討論了比丘刺激勃起的原因，他們只是為了享受接觸的樂趣而不是為了引起射精，而判決結果是，即使無意中造成了射精，他們也不會受到懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Aside from the thullaccaya, the Vibhaṅga assigns no other derived offenses under this rule. A bhikkhu who has an ejaculation while thinking sensual thoughts but without making any physical effort to cause it, incurs no penalty regardless of whether the idea crosses his mind that he would like to have an emission, and regardless of whether he enjoys it when it occurs. However, the Commentary notes here that even though there is no offense involved, one should not let oneself be overcome by sensual thoughts in this way. This point is borne out by the famous simile that occurred to Prince Siddhattha before his Awakening and that later, as Buddha, he related to a number of listeners:</td>
<td>除了《偷蘭遮》之外，《經分別》在本戒條下沒有指定任何其他衍生違犯。比丘在想性欲念頭時射精，但沒有付出任何身體努力來導致射精，無論他的心中是否有想要射精的念頭，也無論當射精發生時他是否享受它，都不會受到懲罰。然而，《義註》在此指出，即使沒有犯戒，也不應該這樣讓自己被欲念所征服。悉達多太子在成佛之前，後來成為佛陀時，對許多聽眾講了一個著名的比喻，證實了這一點：</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes that some interpreters had taken the idiomatic term in the rule translated as, “while dreaming (<em>supinantā</em>),” and read it as a compound meaning literally “at the end of a dream (<em>supin’antā</em>),” thus opening an allowance for intentional effort and emission when awakening from a soon-to-be-wet dream. However, the Commentary goes on to rule out this overly literal interpretation, stating that what happens in the mind while one is sleeping falls in the bounds of the Abhidhamma, but what happens after one awakens falls within the bounds of the Vinaya; and that there is no such thing as a misdeed performed when one is in a “non-negligible” state of mind that does not count as an offense. (<em>Non-negligible</em>, according to the Sub-commentary, means “normal.”)</td>
<td>《義註》指出，一些解釋者將戒條中的慣用術語翻譯為「做夢時 (<em>supinantā</em>)」，並將其解讀為複合詞，字面意思是「在夢的結尾 (<em>supin'antā</em>)」，從而開緣了當從即將遺精的春夢中醒來時，允許有意識的努力和泄精。然而，《義註》接著排除了這種過於字面的解釋，指出睡著時內心發生的事情屬於阿毘達摩的範圍，而睡醒後發生的事情則屬於戒律的範圍。當一個人處於「不可忽略」的心態時，任何不端行為都算犯戒。（根據《複註》，<em>不可忽略</em>的意思是「正常」。）</td>

The Commentary goes on to say, however, that if a bhikkhu fully awakens in the course of a wet dream, he should lie still and be extremely careful not to make a move that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. If the process has reached the point where it is irreversible and the ejaculation occurs spontaneously, he incurs no penalty regardless of whether he enjoys it. And as the Commentary quotes from the Kurundī, one of the ancient Sinhalese commentaries on which it is based, if he wakes up in the course of a wet dream and grabs hold of his penis to prevent the ejaculation from soiling his robes or bedding, there is no offense.<!-- 覺音論師注釋書略述

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga explains the term <em>overcome with lust</em> as meaning “impassioned, desiring, a mind bound by attraction.” <em>Altered</em>, it says, can refer in general to one of three states of mind—passion, aversion, or delusion—but here it refers specifically to passion.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary adds a piece of Abhidhamma analysis at this point, saying that <em>altered</em> refers to the moment when the mind leaves its state of pure neutrality in the <em>bhavaṅga</em> under the influence of desire. Thus the factor of intention here can be fulfilled not only by a prolonged or intense feeling of desire, but also by a momentary attraction.</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary also tries to limit the range of passion to which this rule applies, saying that it covers only desire for the enjoyment of contact. As we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, the ancient commentators formulated a list of eleven types of lust, each mutually exclusive, and the question of which rule applies to a particular case depends on which type of lust provokes the bhikkhu’s actions. Thus if a bhikkhu lusting for intercourse touches a woman, it says, he incurs only a dukkaṭa as a preliminary to sexual intercourse under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>. If he touches her through his lust for an ejaculation, he incurs a thullaccaya as a preliminary to causing an emission under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>. Only if he touches her with the simple desire to enjoy the sensation of contact does he incur a saṅghādisesa under this rule.</td>
<td>《義註》也試圖限制本戒條適用的激情範圍，稱它僅涵蓋享受接觸的欲望。正如我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>中所指出的，古代註釋者列出了十一種貪欲的清單，每種貪欲都是相互排斥的，而哪種戒條適用於某個特定情況的問題取決於哪種類型的貪欲會激起比丘的行動。因此，如果一個欲求性交的比丘觸摸一個女人，它說，他只會犯《突吉羅》，作為<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>下性交的預備。如果他出於射精的欲望而觸摸她，他就會犯《偷蘭遮》，作為<a class="reference external" href="#sg1">《僧殘》一</a>下引起射精的預備。只有當他懷著享受接觸感覺的純粹欲望去觸碰她時，他才會根據本戒條犯《僧殘》。</td>

<tr><td>This system, though very neat and orderly, flies in the face of common sense and, as we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, contradicts the Vibhaṅga as well, so there is no need to adopt it. We can stick with the Vibhaṅga to this rule and say that <em>any</em> state of passion fulfills the factor of intention here. The Commentary’s discussion, though, is useful in showing that the passion needn’t be full-scale sexual lust. Even a momentary desire to enjoy the sensation of physical contact—overwhelming enough that one acts on it—is enough to fulfill this factor.</td>
<td>這個系統雖然非常整潔有序，但卻違背了常識，並且正如我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>中指出的那樣，也與《經分別》相矛盾，因此沒有必要採用它。我們可以遵循本戒條的《經分別》，並說<em>任何</em>激情狀態都滿足這裡的意圖因素。不過，《義註》的討論有助於顯示激情不一定是全面的性欲。即使是一瞬間想要享受身體接觸的感覺——強烈到足以讓人採取行動——也足以滿足本因素。</td>

The Vinīta-vatthu includes a case of a bhikkhu giving a woman a blow with his shoulder: He too incurs a saṅghādisesa, which shows that the Vibhaṅga’s list is meant to cover all similar actions as well. If a bhikkhu with lustful mind does anything of this sort to a living woman’s body, perceiving her to be a woman, he incurs the full penalty under this rule. As noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, mouth-to-mouth penetration with any human being or common animal would incur a thullaccaya.

<tr><td>However, in the context of this rule, and other rules in the Pāṭimokkha where paṇḍakas enter into the calculation of an offense, the Commentary does not say whether <em>paṇḍaka</em> covers all five types of paṇḍakas or only those not allowed to ordain. In other words, in the context of these rules do “sprinkled ones” and voyeurs count as paṇḍakas or men? In the context of this rule the practical implications of the distinction are minor: If counted as men, they would be grounds for a dukkaṭa; if paṇḍakas, grounds for a thullaccaya. However, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">Pc 6</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">44</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">45</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">67</a>, the distinction makes the difference between an offense and a non-offense, and so it is an important one to draw. There seems good reason to count them as men under all rules, for if they could ordain and yet were considered paṇḍakas under these rules, the texts would have been obliged to deal with the issue of how bhikkhus were to treat validly ordained paṇḍakas in their midst in the context of these rules. But they don’t. This shows that the issue never arose, which means that, for the purposes of all the rules, these two types of individuals count as men.</td>
<td>然而，在本戒條的脈絡下，以及《波羅提木叉》中將黃門納入犯戒計算的其他戒條中，《義註》並沒有說明<em>黃門</em>是否涵蓋所有五種類型的黃門或僅涵蓋那些不允許出家的類型。換句話說，在這些戒條的脈絡下，「被注入者」和窺淫癖者算是「黃門」還是「男人」？在本戒條的戒條下，這種區別的實際含義是較不重要的：如果被算作男人，他們將成為《突吉羅》的理由；如果是黃門，則為《偷蘭遮》的理由。然而，在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">《波逸提》六</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">四四</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">四五</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">六七</a>下，這一區別決定了犯戒和不犯之間的區別，因此這是一個重要的問題。似乎有充分的理由在所有戒條下將他們視為男人，因為如果他們能夠出家，但在這些戒條下仍被視為黃門，那麼文獻就必須處理比丘如何對待他們之中的有效出家的黃門的問題。但文獻沒有。這表明這個問題從未出現過，這意味著，就所有戒條而言，這兩類人都算是男性。</td>

If he makes lustful bodily contact with a paṇḍaka while under the impression that the paṇḍaka is a woman, a man, or an animal, the penalty is a dukkaṭa.

<tr><td>Otherwise, the Vibhaṅga does not discuss the issue of bhikkhus who intentionally make active contact with women for purposes other than lust or affection—e.g., helping a woman who has fallen into a raging river—but the Commentary does. It introduces the concept of <em>anāmāsa</em>, things carrying a dukkaṭa penalty when touched; women and women’s clothing top the list. (See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0072.html#BMC2appendixFIVE">BMC2, Appendix V</a> for the entire list.) It then goes into great detail to tell how one should behave when one’s mother falls into a raging river. Under no circumstances, it says, should one grab hold of her, although one may extend a rope, a board, etc., in her direction. If she happens to grab hold of her son the bhikkhu, he should not shake her off but should simply let her hold on as he swims back to shore.</td>
<td>除此之外，《經分別》並沒有討論比丘出於欲望或感情以外的目的而故意與女人主動接觸的問題，例如幫助落入洶湧河流的女人，但《義註》卻討論了這一問題。它引入了 <em>anāmāsa</em> 的概念，即觸摸時會受到《突吉羅》懲罰的事物；女人和女人的服裝位居榜首。（完整清單請參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0072.html#BMC2appendixFIVE">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》附錄五</a>）然後，它詳細講述了當母親掉進洶湧的河流時應該如何行動。它說，在任何情況下，都不應抓住她，儘管可以向她的方向伸出一根繩子、一塊木板等。如果她碰巧抓住了她的兒子比丘，他不應該把她甩開，而應該讓她抓住，然後游回岸邊。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Where the Commentary gets the concept of <em>anāmāsa</em> is hard to say. Perhaps it came from the practices of the brahman caste, who are very careful not to touch certain things and people of certain lower castes. At any rate, there is no direct basis for it in the Canon. Although the concept has received wide acceptance in Theravādin Communities, many highly respected Vinaya experts have made an exception right here, saying that there is nothing wrong in touching a woman when one’s action is based not on lust but on a desire to save her from danger. Even if there is an offense in doing so, there are other places where Buddhaghosa recommends that one be willing to incur a minor penalty for the sake of compassion (e.g., digging a person out of a hole into which he has fallen), and the same principle surely holds here.</td>
<td>很難說《義註》中的 <em>anāmāsa</em> 概念是從哪裡得到的。也許這來自婆羅門種姓的習俗，婆羅門種姓非常小心，不接觸某些低種姓的某些事物和人。無論如何，在《聖典》裡並沒有直接的依據。儘管這個概念在上座部僧團中得到了廣泛接受，但許多德高望重的律宗專家卻在這裡破例，他們說，當一個人的行為不是基於欲望而是出於拯救她脫離危險的願望時，觸摸女性並沒有什麼錯。即使這樣做是犯戒的，<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%BA%E9%9F%B3">佛音</a>在其他地方也建議人們出於慈悲心而願意受到輕微的懲罰（例如，將一個人從掉進的洞裡挖出來），並且同樣的原則在這裡肯定成立。</td>

<tr><td>For the paṇḍaka one assumes to be a woman, the penalty in all the above cases is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>對於認為是女性的黃門來說，上述所有情況的懲罰都是《突吉羅》。</td>

<tr><td>These penalties for indirect contact have inspired the Commentary to say that if a bhikkhu makes contact with a clothed portion of a woman’s body or uses a clothed portion of his body to make contact with hers, and the cloth is so thick that neither his body hairs nor hers can penetrate it, the penalty is only a thullaccaya because he is not making direct contact. Only if the contact is skin-to-skin, skin-to-hair, or hair-to-hair (as might be possible through thin cloth) does he commit the full offense. Thus a bhikkhu who fondles the breasts, buttocks, or crotch of a fully clothed woman would incur only a thullaccaya because the contact was indirect.</td>
<td>這些對間接接觸的懲罰啟發《義註》說，如果比丘接觸女性身體的穿著部分，或者用自己身體的穿著部分接觸她的身體，而且衣服很厚，以至於他跟她的身體上沒有毛髮可以穿透它，懲罰只是《偷蘭遮》，因為他沒有直接接觸。只有當接觸是皮膚對皮膚、皮膚對頭髮或頭髮對頭髮（可能透過薄布）時，他才構成完全犯戒。因此，比丘撫摸衣著整齊的女人的胸部、臀部或胯部時，只會犯《偷蘭遮》，因為這種接觸是間接的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is a certain logic to the commentators’ assertion here, but why they adopted it is unclear. Perhaps they drew a parallel to the following rule—concerning lustful remarks made to a woman—which also contains derived offenses for remarks directed at items “connected with the body.” In that case, defining <em>connected with the body</em> to include clothing worn by the woman does no violence to the nature of the activity covered by the rule, for it is possible to make remarks about a woman’s clothing without using words that touch on her body at all.</td>
<td>註釋者的說法有一定的邏輯性，但為什麼會這樣，卻不得而知。也許他們與以下戒條（關於對女性發表淫欲言論）進行了類比，該戒條還包含針對「與身體相連」的物品的言論的衍生違犯。在該情況下，將<em>與身體相連</em>的定義包括女性所穿的衣服並不違反戒條所涵蓋的活動的性質，因為可以在不使用觸及女性身體的詞語的情況下對女性的衣服進行評論。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Here, however, the nature of the activity is different. If one pushes a woman, it does not matter how many layers of cloth lie between her body and one’s hand: One is pushing both the cloth and her. If one squeezes her fully clothed breasts, again, one is squeezing both the cloth and the breasts. To say that one is pushing or squeezing only the cloth is a denial of the true nature of the action. Also, if one stroked a woman’s fully clothed thigh, it is unlikely that the strength of her reaction would depend on whether her body hairs penetrated the cloth, or if one was wearing latex gloves that prevented her hair from touching one’s skin. Common linguistic usage reflects these facts, as does the law.</td>
<td>然而，這裡的活動性質有所不同。如果一個人推著一個女人，不管她的身體和手之間有多少層布：一個人既在推布，也在推她。如果一個人擠壓她穿著衣服的乳房，那麼，一個人同時擠壓了衣服和乳房。如果說一個人只推或擠壓布料，那就是對這動作真實性質的否認。此外，如果有人撫摸一位女性穿著衣服的大腿，她的反應強度不太可能取決於她的體毛是否穿透了布料，或者是否戴著乳膠手套以防止她的頭髮接觸自己的皮膚。常見的語言用法反映了這些事實，法律也是如此。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The question is, does the Vibhaṅga follow this common linguistic usage, and the answer appears to be Yes. In none of the Vinīta-vatthu cases concerning physical contact with women does the Buddha ever ask the bhikkhu if he made contact with the clothed or unclothed portions of the woman’s body. This suggests that the question of whether she was clothed or unclothed is irrelevant to the offense. In one of the cases, “a certain bhikkhu, seeing a woman he encountered coming in the opposite direction, was impassioned and gave her a blow with his shoulder.” Now, bhikkhus sometimes have their shoulders bared and sometimes robed; women walking along a road may have different parts of their body clothed or bared. If the presence or absence of a layer or two of cloth between the bhikkhu’s shoulder and the woman’s body were relevant to the severity of the offense, then given the Buddha’s usual thoroughness in cases like this he would have asked about the amount, location, and thickness of clothing on both the bhikkhu and the woman, to determine if the offense was a dukkaṭa, a thullaccaya, or a saṅghādisesa. But he didn’t. He simply penalized the bhikkhu with a saṅghādisesa, which again suggests that the presence or absence of cloth between the bhikkhu and the woman is irrelevant in all cases under this rule.</td>
<td>問題是，《經分別》是否遵循這種常見的語言用法，答案似乎是肯定的。在所有涉及與女性身體接觸的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例中，佛陀都沒有問過比丘是否接觸過女性身體的有衣或無衣部分。這顯示她是否穿衣服的問題與犯戒無關。在其中一個案例中，「一位比丘，看到他遇到的一位女人朝相反的方向走來，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a05">充滿激情地用肩膀碰了她</a>。」現在，比丘有時裸露肩膀，有時穿著袈裟；走在路上的女人可能會在身體的不同部位穿衣服或裸露。如果比丘的肩膀和女人的身體之間有或沒有一層或兩層布與犯戒的嚴重程度有關，那麼鑑於佛陀在這種情況下一貫的徹底性，他會詢問比丘和女人的衣服的數量、位置和厚度，以確定所犯的罪行是《突吉羅》、《偷蘭遮》還是《僧殘》。但他沒有。他只是用《僧殘》懲罰比丘，這再次表明，在本戒條下，比丘和女人之間有或沒有衣服在所有情況下都是無關緊要的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The only cases of indirect contact mentioned in the Vinīta-vatthu refer to contact of a much more remote sort: A bhikkhu pulls a cord of which a woman is holding the other end, pulls a stick of which she is holding the other end, or gives her a playful push with his bowl.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中提到的間接接觸的唯一情況是指一種更遙遠的接觸：<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a07">比丘拉一根繩子，而女人握住另一端，拉動一根棍子，而女人握住另一端</a>，或者<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a09">頑皮地用缽推了她一下</a>。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus in the context of this rule the Vibhaṅga defines “object connected to the body,” through which indirect contact is made, with examples of things that the person is <em>holding</em>. The Vinaya-mukha adds things that are <em>hanging</em> from the person, like the hem of a robe or a dress. In this context, contact made through cloth that the person is wearing would be classed as direct. This would parallel <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, in which the question of whether there is anything covering either of the organs involved in intercourse is completely irrelevant to the offense. Thus the concept of direct and indirect contact here would seem to follow general linguistic usage: If a woman is wearing a long-sleeved shirt, for instance, grabbing her by the arm and grabbing her by the cuff of her shirt are two different things, and would receive different penalties under this rule.</td>
<td>因此，在本戒條的脈絡下，《經分別》定義了「與身體相連的物體」，透過它進行間接接觸，並以人所<em>持有</em>的東西為例。《戒律入口》添加了<em>懸掛</em>在人身上的東西，例如袈裟或服裝的摺邊。在這種脈絡下，透過人所穿的衣服進行的接觸將被歸類為直接接觸。這與<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>類似，其中是否有任何東西覆蓋涉及性交的器官的問題與犯戒完全無關。因此，這裡直接和間接接觸的概念似乎遵循一般語言用法：例如，如果一個女人穿著長袖襯衫，抓住她的手臂和抓住她襯衫的袖口是兩個不同的事情，並根據本戒條受到不同的懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>According to the Vibhaṅga, if a bhikkhu feels desire for contact with a woman and makes an effort that does not achieve even indirect contact—e.g., making a squeezing motion in the air near one of her breasts—the penalty is a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>根據《經分別》，如果<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a11">一個比丘感到想要與一位女性接觸，並且做出了努力，但沒有實現甚至間接的接觸</a>——例如，在靠近她的乳房的空氣中做出擠壓動作——懲罰是《突吉羅》。</td>

The PTS edition of the K/Commentary reads the ellipses as including the thullaccaya and dukkaṭa for speaking lustfully to a paṇḍaka, but not the dukkaṭas for speaking lustfully to a man or animal. The editors of the Thai edition of the Canon have interpreted the parallelism with the similar paragraph in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a> as indicating that “man” and “animal” <em>would</em> come under the ellipses, and so have included these cases in the text.

In one case the penalty is a thullaccaya; in the others, a dukkaṭa. The Commentary takes no note of the difference; the Sub-commentary notes it but has trouble making sense of it.

<tr><td>There is, however, a pattern to the Vinīta-vatthu cases. The thullaccaya case is the only one in which the bhikkhu actually mentions a word for genitals or anus (<em>magga</em>, which also means road, the meaning the woman understood). In the dukkaṭa cases, bhikkhus either use euphemisms for sexual intercourse (“plowing,” “working”) or else they make statements in which the words <em>genitals</em> or <em>anus</em> are implied but not actually stated. From this pattern we can argue that if a bhikkhu speaking to a woman makes direct reference to her genitals or anus, and the woman doesn’t immediately understand that he is referring to those things, he incurs a thullaccaya. If he makes a euphemistic reference to sexual intercourse or an implied reference to her genitals or anus, and she doesn’t immediately understand what he is referring to, he incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense for a bhikkhu who speaks aiming at (spiritual) welfare (<em>attha</em>—this can also mean the “meaning of the Dhamma”), aiming at Dhamma, or aiming at teaching. Thus, for example, if one is talking in front of women and has no lustful intent, one may recite or explain this training rule or go into detail on the topic of the loathsomeness of the body as a topic of meditation, all without incurring a penalty. The Commentary here adds an example of a bhikkhu addressing a sexually deformed woman, telling her to be heedful in her practice so as not to be born that way again. If, however, one were to broach any of these topics out of a desire to enjoy saying something lewd to one’s listeners, one would not be immune from an offense. The New K/Sub-commentary illustrates this point with an example: A bhikkhu, teaching the Vibhaṅga of this rule to a bhikkhunī, departs from a normal tone of voice and keeps sniggering while reciting the examples of lewd speech. This sort of behavior, it says, incurs the full offense here.</td>

<tr><td>At first glance this rule might seem redundant with the preceding one, for what we have here is another case of a bhikkhu advising, begging, or imploring a woman to perform sexual intercourse. The Sub-commentary, borrowing the Commentary’s classification of types of lust, states that the rules differ in terms of the lust involved. According to it, only the desire to say something lewd would fall under the preceding rule; only the desire for sexual intercourse would fall here. However, as we have seen, the Commentary’s neat system for classifying desires contradicts some important passages in the Vibhaṅga, and so the Sub-commentary’s explanation has no ground on which to stand.</td>

<tr><td>“Giving,” in the Buddha’s time, was a common euphemism for having sex. If a woman “gave” to a man, that meant that she willingly engaged in sexual intercourse with him. Now, Buddhism was not the only religion of the time to teach that gifts—of a more innocent sort—given to contemplatives produced great reward to those who gave them, and ultimately somebody somewhere came up with the idea that because sex was the highest gift, giving it to a contemplative would produce the highest reward. Whether this idea was first formulated by faithful women or by clever contemplatives is hard to say. Several cases in the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> tell of bhikkhus approached or attacked by women professing this belief, which shows that it had some currency: Sex was somehow seen as a way to higher benefits through the law of kamma.</td>
<td>在佛陀時代，「給予」是性行為的常見委婉說法。如果一個女人「給予」一個男人，那就意味著她願意與他發生性關係。現在，佛教並不是當時唯一的宗教教導說：給予沙門的布施（單純的那種）會給那些給予布施的人帶來巨大的回報，最終有人提出了這樣的想法，因為性是最高的布施，將其給予沙門將產生最高的回報。很難說這個想法最初是由忠實的女性提出的，還是由聰明的沙門提出的。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的幾個案例講述了比丘受到自稱這種信仰的女人接近或攻擊的情況，這表明它具有一定的流行性：性在某種程度上被視為透過業力法則獲得更高利益的一種方式。</td>

<tr><td>Because the preceding rule gives exemptions for bhikkhus speaking “aiming at (spiritual) welfare <em>(attha)</em>, aiming at Dhamma,” some misguided souls who did not comprehend the Buddha’s teachings on sensuality might believe that welfare of this sort might fit under the exemption. The origin story alludes to this point in a punning way, in that the word for “need” is also <em>attha</em>, and perhaps the widow, in using the word, had both its meanings in mind: Her spiritual welfare would be enhanced by meeting a bhikkhu’s needs. Even today, although the rationale might be different, there are people who believe that having sex with spiritual teachers is beneficial for one’s spiritual well being. Thus we have this separate rule to show that the Buddha would have no part in such a notion, and that a bhikkhu who tries to suggest that his listener would benefit from having sex with him is not exempt from an offense.</td>
<td>因為前一戒條給予比丘「為了（精神）福祉<em>（attha）</em>、為了法」而說的豁免，一些不理解佛陀關於欲樂教義的被誤導心靈可能會認為這種福祉可能屬於豁免範圍。起源故事以雙關語的方式間接提到了這一點，因為「需要」這個詞也是 <em>attha</em>，也許寡婦在使用這個詞時考慮到了它的兩種含義：她的精神福祉將通過滿足比丘的需要而得到增強。即使在今天，儘管理由可能有所不同，但仍有人相信與靈性導師發生性關係對靈性健康有益。因此，我們有這條單獨的戒條來表明佛陀不會參與這樣的觀念，而試圖暗示聽眾會從與他發生性關係中受益的比丘也不能免於犯戒。</td>

In other words, given this sort of desire, this sort of statement is allowable. From this interpretation it can be argued that when a bhikkhu is speaking without any lust or sensual desire of any sort, he may make any of the remarks that would fulfill the factor of effort here in the presence of others without incurring an offense. A prime example would be when, while explaining this rule, he quotes examples of the remarks it forbids.</td>

They were continually begging, continually hinting: ‘Give a man, give labor, give an ox, give a wagon, give a knife, give an ax, give an adze, give a hoe, give a chisel, give rushes, give bamboo, give reeds, give grass, give clay.’ People, harassed with the begging, harassed with the hinting, on seeing bhikkhus would feel apprehensive, alarmed, would run away; would take another route, face another direction, close the door.

<tr><td>The Canon repeatedly refers to two arrangements for the ownership of dwellings used by bhikkhus: They belong either to the Community or to an individual (or group of individuals). From the point of view of Community governance, the prior arrangement is preferable, for the Community can then allot the dwelling as it sees fit (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>). Also, a number of the rules governing the care and use of huts—such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">Pc 15</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc16">16</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc17">17</a>—apply only to dwellings belonging to the Community.</td>
<td>《聖典》一再提到比丘所使用的住處的所有權有兩種安排：它們要麼屬於僧團，要麼屬於個人（或個人團體）。從僧團治理的角度來看，事先安排是更可取的，因為僧團可以根據需要分配住處（參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第十八章</a>）。此外，許多管理小屋維護和使用的戒條（例如<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc15">《波逸提》十五</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc16">十六</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc17">十七</a>）僅適用於屬於僧團的住處。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to this rule defines <em>destined for himself</em> as “for his own use.” On the surface this could mean that one plans to use the hut after handing ownership over to the Community, but the Commentary states that this is not so. To dedicate something for one’s own use, it says, is to claim ownership over it: In this case, one regards the dwelling as “mine.” The Commentary’s position is supported by the protocols followed by the lodging bestower and lodging assignor (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">BMC2, Chapter 18</a>) in allotting dwellings belonging to the Community: Outside of the Rains-residence, a bhikkhu could be moved from a Community dwelling at any time; during the Rains-residence, the bhikkhu who built a particular dwelling might find himself unable to stay there because many bhikkhus with more seniority or more pressing needs had decided to spend the Rains in that location. Thus if a bhikkhu planned the dwelling for his own use, he would not want it to be subject to the protocols governing Community dwellings.</td>
<td>本戒條的《經分別》將<em>為自己建造</em><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a10">定義為「供他自己使用」</a>。從表面上看，這可能意味著計劃在將所有權移交給僧團後使用小屋，但《義註》指出事實並非如此。它說，將某物奉獻給自己使用，就是聲稱對其擁有所有權：在這種情況下，將住處視為「我的」。《義註》的立場得到了住宿贈予者和住宿分配者在分配屬於僧團的住處時所遵循的行儀（參見<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0058.html#BMC2chapter18">《佛教修道準則 第二冊》第十八章</a>）的支持：在雨安居之外，比丘可以隨時從僧團住處搬走；在雨安居期間，建造特定住處的比丘可能會發現自己無法住在那裡，因為許多戒臘較高或有更迫切需要的比丘決定在該地點度過雨安居。因此，如果比丘計劃將住處供自己使用，他不希望它受到管理僧團住處的行儀的約束。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s interpretation thus suggests that this rule and the following one were intended to discourage bhikkhus from maintaining ownership over the huts they build, for as the non-offense clauses state, the stipulations in this rule do not apply to huts built for the use of others. As the Commentary notes, this exemption applies both to huts built for other people—such as one’s preceptor or mentor—or for the Community. This would open a loophole for one to build a hut for another bhikkhu and for him to claim ownership over it independently of the Community, all without following the stipulations under the rules, but apparently the compilers of the Vibhaṅga did not regard the act of building a hut as a gift for another bhikkhu as something they had the right to forbid.</td>
<td>因此，《義註》的解釋表明，本戒條和以下一條戒條的目的是阻礙比丘保留對其所建造的小屋的所有權，因為正如不犯條款所規定的那樣，本戒條中的規定不適用於為其他人使用而建造的小屋。正如《義註》所指出的，這項豁免適用於為其他人（例如戒師或導師）或為僧團建造的小屋。這將打開一個漏洞，讓某人為另一位比丘建造一間小屋，並讓他獨立於僧團而聲稱擁有它的所有權，所有這些都沒有遵守戒條的規定，但顯然，《經分別》的編纂者並沒有考慮建造一間小屋作為禮物送給另一位比丘的行為，因為他們有權禁止這樣做。</td>

<tr><td>This factor is divided into two main sub-factors: the hut and the procedures that need to be followed to get the Community’s permission for its construction.</td>
<td>此因素分為兩個主要子因素：小屋和獲得僧團許可建造小屋所需遵循的程序。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The hut.</em> The Vibhaṅga defines a hut as “plastered inside, outside, or both.” It also states that this rule does not apply to a <em>leṇa</em>, a <em>guhā</em>, or to a grass hut. A leṇa, according to the Commentary, is a cave. A guhā it doesn’t define, except to say that guhās may be built out of wood, stone, or earth. And as for a grass hut, the Commentary says that this refers to any building with a grass <em>roof</em>, which means that even a dwelling with plastered walls but a grass roof would not count as a hut under this rule (although a hut whose roof has been plastered and then covered with grass <em>would</em> count as a hut here).</td>
<td><em>小屋。</em>《經分別》<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a08">將小屋定義為「內部、外部或兩者都塗有灰泥」</a>。它還指出，本戒條不適用於 <em>leṇa</em> 、 <em>guhā</em> 或草屋。根據《義註》， <em>leṇa</em> 是一個洞穴。它沒有定義 guhā ，只是說 guhā 可以用木材、石頭或泥土來建造。至於草屋，《義註》中說，這是指任何有草<em>屋頂</em>的建築物，這意味著即使是抹灰牆但有草屋頂的住處，在本戒條下也不能算作小屋（雖然屋頂被抹灰然後覆蓋草的小屋在這裡<em>也</em>算是小屋）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary goes on to stipulate that the plastering mentioned in the Vibhaṅga refers to a plastered <em>roof</em>, that the plaster must be either clay or white lime (plastering with cow dung or mud doesn’t count, although cement would probably come under “white lime” here), and that the plastering on the inside or outside of the roof must be contiguous with the plastering on the inside or outside of the walls. Thus if the builder leaves a gap in the plastering around the top of the wall so that the plastering of the roof and the plastering of the walls don’t touch at any point, the building doesn’t qualify as a hut and so doesn’t come under the rule.</td>
<td>《義註》接著規定，《經分別》中所提到的抹灰指的是抹灰的<em>屋頂</em>，抹灰必須是粘土或白石灰（用牛糞或泥土抹灰不算，儘管水泥可能屬於此處的「白石灰」），且屋頂內側或外側的抹灰必須與牆壁內側或外側的抹灰互相連接。因此，如果建築者在牆頂周圍的抹灰中留下了一個間隙，使得屋頂的抹灰和牆壁的抹灰在任何一點都不會接觸，那麼該建築就不符合小屋的資格，因此不受戒條約束。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Sub-commentary treats the question raised by the Commentary’s emphasis on the plastering of the roof: Does this mean that a dwelling with a plastered roof but unplastered walls would also count as a hut? Arguing from the Commentary’s many references to making the roof-plastering contiguous with the wall-plastering, the Sub-commentary concludes that the answer is No: Both the roof and the walls must be plastered.</td>
<td>《複註》處理了《義註》中強調屋頂抹灰所提出的問題：這是否意味著屋頂抹灰但牆壁未抹灰的住處也算是小屋？根據《義註》中多次提及使屋頂抹灰與牆壁抹灰互相連接，《複註》得出的結論是答案是否定的：屋頂和牆壁都必須抹灰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The commentaries’ stipulations on these points may seem like attempts to create gaping loopholes in the rule, but there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove them wrong. Perhaps in those days only buildings that were fully plastered, roof and all, were considered to be finished, permanent structures, while everything else was considered makeshift and temporary and thus not worth the fuss and bother of the procedures we will discuss below.</td>
<td>註釋對這些要點的規定可能看起來像是試圖在戒條中製造巨大的漏洞，但《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明它們是錯的。也許在那些時日裡，只有完全抹灰的建築物，包括屋頂和所有東西，才被認為是完成的、永久性的結構，而其他一切都被認為是臨時湊合的，因此不值得我們在下面討論的程序中大驚小怪和麻煩。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At another point in its discussions, the Commentary adds that any building three sugata spans wide or less is not big enough to move a bed around in and so does not count as a hut under this rule. The Commentary itself defines a sugata span as three times the span of a normal person, which would put it at approximately 75 cm. More recent calculations based on the fact that the Buddha was not abnormally tall set the sugata span at 25 cm.</td>
<td>在討論的另一點上，《義註》補充說，任何寬度為三善至張手或更小的建築物都不足以移動一張床，因此根據本戒條不算作小屋。《義註》本身將善至張手定義為正常人張手的三倍，即大約 75 公分。根據佛陀身高並無異常的事實，最近的計算將善至張手設定為 25 公分。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The maximum size of the hut</em>, as the rule states, is no more than twelve spans long and seven spans wide, or approximately 3 x 1.75 meters. For some reason the Vibhaṅga states that the length of the hut is measured from the outside (excluding the plastering, says the Commentary), while the width is measured from the inside. Neither of these measurements may be exceeded even by the breadth of a hair. Thus a hut measuring ten by eight spans, even though it has less floor area than a twelve-by-seven-span hut, would exceed the standard width and so would be a violation of this rule.</td>
<td>依戒條，<em>小屋的最大尺寸</em>不得超過長十二張手、寬七張手，即約 3 x 1.75 公尺。由於某種原因，《經分別》規定，小屋的長度是從外部測量的（《義註》中說，不包括抹灰），而寬度是從內部測量的。即使是一根頭髮絲的寬度也不能超過這些尺寸。因此，一個十張手乘以八張手的小屋，即使其建築面積比十二張手乘以七張手的小屋小，也會超出標準寬度，因此會違反本戒條。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>The procedures</em>. If, for his own use, a bhikkhu is planning to build a hut as defined in this rule, he must choose a site, clear it, and ask for a Community to inspect and approve it before he can go ahead with the actual construction.</td>
<td><em>程序</em>。如果比丘打算按照本戒條建造一間小屋供自己使用，他必須選擇一個地點，清理它，並請求僧團檢查和批准，然後才能繼續實際建造。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>The site</em> must be free of disturbances and have adequate space.</td>
<td>—<em>場地</em>必須不受干擾並有合適的空間。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga gives a long list of “disturbances,” which for ease of understanding we can divide into three categories: A site free of disturbances is (1) not the abode of such creatures as termites, ants, or rats who might do harm to the building. (2) It is not the abode of those—such as snakes, scorpions, tigers, lions, elephants, or bears—who might do harm to its inhabitant. The Commentary states that the Vibhaṅga’s purpose in forbidding a bhikkhu from building on a site where termites and other small animals have their home is to show compassion to these and other small creatures like them by not destroying their nests. As for the stipulation against building where snakes and other dangerous animals live, this also extends, it says, to the areas where they regularly forage for food.</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0210a09">《經分別》列出了一長串「干擾」清單</a>，為了便於理解，我們可以將其分為三類：沒有干擾的場所是（1）不是白蟻、螞蟻或老鼠等可能對建築物造成損害的生物的住所。（2）它不是蛇、蝎子、老虎、獅子、大象或熊等可能傷害其居住者的動物的住所。《義註》指出，《經分別》禁止比丘在白蟻和其他小動物棲息的地方建造房屋的目的是為了表達對白蟻和其他小動物的慈悲，不破壞它們的巢穴。至於禁止在蛇等危險動物居住的地方建造建築的規定，也適用於蛇等危險動物經常覓食的區域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>(3) The site is not near any places that will disturb the bhikkhu’s peace and quiet. Examples given in the Vibhaṅga are: fields, orchards, places of execution, cemeteries, pleasure groves, royal property, elephant stables, horse stables, prisons, taverns, slaughterhouses, highways, crossroads, public rest-houses, and meeting places.</td>
<td>（3）該地點不靠近任何會擾亂比丘安寧的地方。《經分別》中所舉的例子有：田野、果園、刑場、墓園、遊園、皇家地產、象厩、馬廄、監獄、酒館、屠宰場、高速公路、十字路口、公共休息室和聚會場所。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>Adequate space</em> means that there is enough room on the site for a yoked wagon or a man carrying a ladder to go around the proposed hut. The question arises as to whether this means that all trees within that radius of the hut must be cut down or simply that there must be enough land around the hut so that if the trees were not there it would be possible to go around the hut in the ways mentioned. The Sub-commentary states that the stipulation for adequate space is so that the hut will not be built on the edge of a precipice or next to a cliff wall, and the Vinaya-mukha notes that the Vibhaṅga here is following the Laws of Manu (an ancient Indian legal text) in ensuring that the dwelling not be built right against someone else’s property. Both of these statements suggest that there is no need to cut the trees down.</td>
<td><em>合適的空間</em>意味著場地上有足夠的空間供一輛有軛的馬車或一個攜帶梯子的人在擬建造的小屋周圍行走。問題是，這是否意味著小屋半徑內的所有樹木都必須被砍伐，或者只是小屋周圍必須有足夠的土地，這樣如果沒有樹木，就可以在小屋周圍以提到的方式行走。《複註》指出，對合適空間的規定如是，以至於小屋不能建在懸崖邊緣或懸崖壁旁邊，而《戒律入口》指出，這裡的《經分別》遵循<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%91%A9%E5%A5%B4%E6%B3%95%E8%AB%96">《摩奴法典》</a>（古印度法律文本），以確保住處不會侵犯他人的財產。這兩種說法都顯示沒有必要砍伐樹木。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinaya-mukha deduces further from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion that the procedures for getting the site approved are concerned basically with laying claim to unclaimed land and thus don’t need to be followed in locations where the Community already owns the land, such as in a monastery; if a bhikkhu in such Communities wishes to build a hut for his own use on monastery land, he need only get the approval of the abbot. Nothing in the ancient texts, however, supports this opinion.</td>
<td>《戒律入口》從《經分別》的討論中進一步推斷，獲得場地批准的程序基本上涉及對無人認領的土地提出主張，因此不需要在僧團已經擁有土地的地方遵循，例如在寺院裡；如果這樣的僧團的比丘想在寺院土地上建造一間小屋供自己使用，他只需得到住持的批准即可。然而，古代文獻中並沒有任何內容支持這種觀點。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Clearing the site</em>. Before notifying the local Community, the bhikkhu must get the site cleared—so says the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary adds that he should get it leveled as well. In both cases, he should arrange to have this done in such a way that does not violate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">Pc 10</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc11">11</a>. If one is planning to build the hut on monastery grounds, the wise policy would be to obtain permission from the abbot before clearing the site. Again, the question arises as to whether <em>clearing the site</em> means cutting down the trees on the spot where one proposes building the hut. In the origin story to the following rule, Ven. Channa caused an uproar by cutting down a venerated tree on a site where he planned to build, which led the Buddha to formulate the rule that the Community must inspect and approve the site to prevent uproars of this sort. This suggests that <em>clearing the site</em> here means clearing the underbrush so that the presence or absence of termites, etc., can be clearly determined. Only after the Community has approved the site should the necessary trees be cut down.</td>
<td>——<em>清理場地</em>。在通知當地僧團之前，比丘必須清理該場地——《經分別》如是說，《義註》補充說他也應該把它夷為平地。在這兩種情況下，他都應該以不違反<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc10">《波逸提》十</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0017.html#Pc11">十一</a>的方式進行安排。如果計劃在寺院場地上建造小屋，明智的做法是在清理場地之前獲得住持的許可。再次出現的問題是，<em>清理場地</em>是否意味著砍伐提議建造小屋的地點的樹木。在<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0217a11">下一條戒條的起源故事</a> 中，闡陀尊者在他計劃建造的地方砍倒了一棵受人尊敬的樹木，引起了軒然大波，這導致佛陀制定了戒條，要求僧團必須檢查並批准該地點，以防止此類騷亂。這表明這裡的<em>清理場地</em>意味著清理灌木叢，以便可以清楚地確定白蟻等的存在與否。只有在僧團批准該地點後，才能砍伐必要的樹木。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>—<em>Getting the site inspected</em>. The bhikkhu then goes to the Community and formally asks them to inspect the site. (The Pali passages for this and the remaining formal requests and proclamations are in the Vibhaṅga.) If all the members of the Community are able to go and inspect the site, they should all go. If not, the Community should select some of its members to go and inspect the site in its stead. The Vibhaṅga says that these inspectors should know what does and does not constitute a disturbance and adequate space, and requires that they be chosen by a formal motion with one proclamation. The Commentary says that they may also be chosen by a simple announcement <em>(apalokana)</em>, but this opinion violates the principle set forth in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0052.html#Mv.IX.3.3">Mv.IX.3.3</a> that if a shorter form is used for a transaction requiring a longer form, the transaction is invalid. Thus the Commentary’s opinion here cannot stand.</td>
<td>——<em>檢查場地</em>。然後，比丘前往僧團並正式要求他們檢查場地。（關於這一點的巴利段落以及其餘的正式請求和羯磨文<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0208a13">都在《經分別》中</a>。）如果僧團的所有成員都能夠去檢查該地點，他們都應該去。如果不能，僧團應選擇一些成員代替其前往現場檢查。《經分別》說，這些檢查員應該知道什麼構成干擾、什麼不構成干擾以及合適的空間，並要求通過正式的一白和一羯磨（白二羯磨）來挑選他們。《義註》說，也可以透過簡單的<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/a/apalokana/">求聽</a> <em>（apalokana）</em>來挑選他們，但這種意見違反了<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_009#0411a01">《大品》.九.3.3</a>中規定的原則，即如果需要較長形式的羯磨使用較短的形式，則該羯磨無效。因此，《義註》的觀點不能成立。</td>

<tr><td>The inspectors then visit the site. If they find any disturbances or see that the site has inadequate space, they should tell the bhikkhu not to build there. If the site passes inspection, though, they should return and inform the Community that the site is free of disturbances and has adequate space.</td>
<td>檢查員隨後前往場地。如果他們發現任何干擾或發現該地點沒有合適的空間，他們應該告訴比丘不要在那裡建造。不過，如果該地點通過檢查，他們應該返回並通知僧團該地點沒有受到干擾並且有合適的空間。</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The wording of the training rule, though, suggests that building a hut without a sponsor, for one’s own use, on a site with disturbances and without adequate space would entail a saṅghādisesa; but the Sub-commentary says—without offering explanation—that to read the rule in this way is to misinterpret it. Because the penalty for a multiple saṅghādisesa is the same as that for a single one, there is only one case where this would make an appreciable difference: a hut of the proper size, built on an approved site that has disturbances or does not have adequate space. This is a case of a Community transaction improperly performed: Either the bhikkhus inspecting the site were incompetent, or the disturbances were not immediately apparent. Because the usual penalty for improperly performing a Community transaction is a dukkaṭa (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0052.html#Mv.II.16.4">Mv.II.16.4</a>), this may be why the Vibhaṅga allots penalties as it does. As we noted in the Introduction, in cases where the Vibhaṅga is explaining the training rules that deal with Community transactions, it sometimes has to deviate from the wording of the rules to bring them in line with the general pattern for such transactions, a pattern that was apparently formulated after the rules and came to take precedence over them.</td>
<td>不過，學處的措辭表明，在沒有資助者的情況下，在有干擾且沒有合適空間的場所建造自用的小屋犯一次《僧殘》；但《複註》說——沒有提供解釋——以這種方式解讀本戒條是對它的誤解。由於對多次《僧殘》的懲罰與對單次《僧殘》的懲罰相同，因此只有一種情況會產生明顯的區別：一間大小合適的小屋，建在經批准的場地上，但有干擾或沒有合適的空間。這是一個僧團羯磨執行不當的案例：要麼是檢查現場的比丘無能，要麼是干擾沒有立即顯現出來。因為不當執行僧團羯磨的通常懲罰是《突吉羅》（<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N03n0002_002#0151a11">《大品》.二.16.4</a>），這可能是《經分別》如此分配懲罰的原因。正如我們在<strong>引言</strong>中指出的，在《經分別》解釋處理僧團羯磨的學處的情況下，有時必須偏離戒條的措辭，以使它們符合此類羯磨的一般模式，這種模式顯然是在戒條之後製定的，並且優先於戒條。</td>

<tr><td>Usually, if a Community transaction has been improperly performed, it is invalid and unfit to stand even if the bhikkhus involved think that they are following the proper procedure. In other words, in the case just mentioned, the site would strictly speaking not count as approved, and the hut would involve a saṅghādisesa. However, the Vibhaṅga seems to be making a special exemption here in assigning only a dukkaṭa, perhaps so as not to punish unduly a bhikkhu who went to all the trouble to follow, as best he and his fellow bhikkhus knew how, the proper procedures prior to building his hut.</td>
<td>通常，如果僧團羯磨執行不當，即使相關比丘認為自己遵循了正確的程序，該羯磨也是無效且不適合成立的。換句話說，在剛才提到的情況下，嚴格來說，該地點不算被批准，而小屋將涉及《僧殘》。然而，《經分別》似乎在這裡做出了特殊的豁免，只指定了《突吉羅》，也許是為了不過度懲罰比丘，因為他和他的比丘同儕們都知道如何不辭辛勞地遵循建造小屋之前的正確程序。</td>

<td>《義註》提到一個特殊的例子，兩個比丘建造了一座自用的小屋，但不符合本戒條的規定，在沒有決定小屋的哪一部分歸哪位比丘的情況下完成了。由於他們尚未決定，《義註》指出，在他聲稱擁有自己的小屋部分之前，他們都不會完全違犯。</td>

<tr><td><em>Getting others to build the hut.</em> The Vibhaṅga states that if, instead of building the hut himself, a bhikkhu tells others, “Build this hut for me,” he must inform them of the four stipulations mentioned in this rule. If he neglects to inform them, and they finish the hut in such a way that it does not meet any or all of the stipulations, he incurs all the relevant offenses for the stipulations that he neglected to mention and that the builders violated. For example: He tells them to build a hut of the right size, but neglects to tell them to have the site approved. They build it to the right size, the site is without disturbances and has adequate space but is not approved, and he incurs a saṅghādisesa. Offenses in cases like this apply whether he gets them to start the hut’s construction or gets them to complete a hut that he has started.</td>
<td><em>讓其他人建造小屋。</em>《經分別》規定，如果比丘不是自己建造小屋，而是告訴別人：「為我建造這座小屋」，他必須告知他們本戒條中提到的四項規定。如果他疏忽通知他們，而他們以不符合任何或全部規定的方式完成小屋，他將因他疏忽提及和建造者違反的規定而承擔所有相關違犯。例如：他告訴他們建造一個大小合適的小屋，但沒有告訴他們讓場地被批准。他們把它建得大小合適，場地沒有干擾，有合適的空間，但沒有得到批准，他犯《僧殘》。無論他讓他們開始建造小屋還是讓他們完成他已經開始建造的小屋，這種情況下的犯戒都適用。</td>

<tr><td>If, while the builders are still building the hut, he hears of what they are doing, he must either go himself or send a messenger to tell them of the stipulations he neglected to mention. If he does neither, he incurs a dukkaṭa, and when the hut is finished he incurs all the relevant offenses for the stipulations that he neglected to mention and that the builders violated.</td>
<td>如果在建造者還在建造小屋的時候，他聽到了他們正在做的事情，他必須要麼親自去，要麼派一個使者告訴他們他沒有提到的規定。如果他兩者都不做，他犯《突吉羅》，當小屋完工後，他會因他忽略提及而建造者違反的規定而招致所有相關的違犯。</td>

<tr><td>If, while the hut is still unfinished, he returns to the site and discovers that the stipulations he neglected to mention are being violated, he must either have the hut torn down (to the ground, says the Commentary) and have it rebuilt in line with the stipulations, give it to another bhikkhu or the Community, or face the full penalty—when the hut is finished—for each of the stipulations that he neglected to mention and that the builders violated.</td>
<td>如果在小屋尚未完工時，他回到場地，發現他忽略提及的規定遭到違反，他必須要麼將小屋拆掉（《義註》說是夷為平地），按規定重建它，交給另一個比丘或僧團，要不然當小屋完成時，就因他忽略提及和建造者違反的每一項規定而面臨全額懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu originally mentions the proper stipulations but later learns that the builders are ignoring them, he must go himself or send a messenger to reiterate the stipulations. Not to do so incurs a dukkaṭa. If, having been reminded of the stipulations, the builders still ignore them, the bhikkhu incurs no penalty; but they—if they are bhikkhus—incur a dukkaṭa for each of the three criteria regarding the site that they disobey. As for the standard measurement, they are not bound by it as they are building the hut for another’s use.</td>
<td>如果比丘最初提到了正確的規定，但後來得知建造者忽視了這些規定，他必須親自去或派使者重申這些規定。不這樣做就犯《突吉羅》。如果建築者在被提醒注意這些規定後仍然忽視它們，比丘不會受到懲罰；但是，如果他們是比丘，他們就會因違反有關該場地的三個標準中的每一個而犯《突吉羅》。至於標準尺寸，他們不受它的約束，因為他們建造的小屋是供別人使用的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Begging</strong></td>
<td><strong>乞討</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga to this rule does not go into any great detail on the issue of begging for construction materials. However, the Commentary contains a long discussion of what a bhikkhu may and may not beg for when building any kind of building, even those not covered by this rule. Because the Commentary’s discussion here is not based on the Canon, not all Communities regard these points as binding. Still, many of its suggestions merit serious consideration. Its main points are these:</td>
<td>本戒條的《經分別》並沒有詳細討論乞討建築材料的問題。然而，《義註》包含了關於比丘在建造任何類型的建築物時可以乞討什麼和不可以乞討什麼的長篇討論，即使是那些不在本戒條範圍內的建築物。由於此處《義註》的討論並非基於《聖典》，因此並非所有僧團都認為這些要點具有約束力。儘管如此，其中的許多建議仍值得認真考慮。其要點如下：</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>A bhikkhu may ask for people to give labor in any situation (although this point seems to conflict with the spirit of the origin story to this rule). Thus he may ask stone masons to carry stone posts to his construction site, or carpenters to carry boards there. If, after he has asked them to help with the labor, they volunteer to donate the materials as well, he may accept them without penalty. Otherwise, he has to reimburse them for the materials.</td>
<td>比丘在任何情況下都可以要求人們給予勞力（儘管這一點似乎與本戒條的起源故事的精神相衝突）。因此，他可以請石匠將石柱搬到他的建築工地，或請木匠將木板搬到那裡。如果他要求他們幫忙做工後，他們也自願捐贈材料，他可以接受，不受懲罰。否則的話，他就得給他們補償材料費。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As for tools, vehicles, and other things he will use in the process of construction, he may ask only to borrow them from other people and may not ask for them outright (except when asking from relatives or those who have made an offer). If the tools get damaged, he is responsible for getting them repaired before returning them to the owner. (This opinion, however, seems based on the Commentary’s concept of bhaṇḍadeyya, which we have already rejected under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr2">Pr 2</a>.) The only things he needn’t return to the owner are light articles <em>(lahubhaṇḍa)</em>, which the Sub-commentary identifies as things like reeds, rushes, grass, and clay—i.e., things having little or no monetary value at all.</td>
<td>對於施工過程中使用的工具、車輛等物品，只能向他人借用，不得直接索取（向親戚或提出邀請者索取的除外）。如果工具損壞，他有責任修理好，然後再歸還給所有者。（然而，這個觀點似乎是基於《義註》的 bhaṇḍadeyya 概念，我們已經在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr2">《波羅夷》二</a>中拒絕了這個概念。）他唯一不需要歸還給所有者的東西是輕物品<em>（lahubhaṇḍa）</em>，《複註》將其定為像蘆葦、燈芯草、草和黏土這樣的東西，即幾乎沒有或根本沒有貨幣價值的東西。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This means that unless a bhikkhu is going to build his dwelling out of reeds, etc., or out of thrown-away scraps, he may not ask people in general for any of the materials that will actually go into the dwelling. Keep in mind that these rules were made during a period when wilderness was still plentiful, and solid building materials such as timber and stones were free for the taking. At present, unless a bhikkhu has access to unclaimed wilderness of this sort, to unclaimed garbage, or has enough funds on deposit with his steward (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a>) to cover the cost of materials, his only recourse if he wants a solid structure is either to rammed earth or to hinting.</td>
<td>這意味著，除非比丘要用蘆葦等，或用廢棄的廢料來建造他的住所，否則他不能向一般人索取任何實際用於建造住所的材料。請記住，這些規則是在林野仍然充足、木材和石頭等固體建築材料可以免費取得的時期制定的。目前，除非比丘能夠有權使用此類無人認領的荒野，無人認領的垃圾，或者在他的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA">淨人</a>處存有足夠的資金（參見<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0013/#NP10">《捨墮》十</a>）來支付材料費用，否則如果他想要一個堅固的結構，他唯一的辦法就是要夯土，不然就要暗示。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary notes that while hinting is not allowed with regard to food or cloth, it is allowed with regard to construction materials (although again, this point seems to conflict with the spirit of the origin story). One example it gives is asking, “Do you think this is a good place to build a hut? An ordination hall?” Another example is staking out a construction site in hope that someone will ask, “What are you planning to do here?” If people get the hint and offer the materials, the bhikkhu may accept them. If they don’t, he may not ask directly for any materials except the “light articles” mentioned above.</td>
<td>《義註》指出，雖然在食物或衣服方面不允許暗示，但在建築材料方面卻允許暗示（儘管這一點似乎與起源故事的精神相衝突）。它給出的一個例子是問：「你認為這是建造小屋的好地方嗎？戒堂？」另一個例子是在一個建築工地上立樁標出界線，希望有人會問：「你打算在這裡做什麼？」如果人們得到暗示並提供材料，比丘可以接受。如果沒有，除了上述的「輕物品」之外，他不得直接要求任何材料。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>From this it should be obvious that even in cases not covered by this rule—i.e., the dwelling he is building doesn’t qualify as a “hut,” or he is building something for other people to use—a bhikkhu engaged in construction work should not be burdensome to the laity. This is an important point, as the Buddha illustrated in a story he told to the bhikkhus at Āḷavī. A certain bhikkhu had once come to him with a complaint, and he reports the conversation as follows:</td>
<td>由此可見，即使在本戒條未涵蓋的情況下，即他正在建造的住處不符合「小屋」的資格，或者他正在建造供其他人使用時，從事建築工作的比丘不應成為俗人的負擔。這是很重要的一點，正如佛陀在他向 Āḷavī 的比丘們講述故事中所說明的那樣。有一次，有一位比丘來向他抱怨，他將談話的內容記述如下：<!-- TODO FIXME: replace 地名 Āḷavī -->

In the third watch of the night make this announcement three times: “Listen to me, good birds. I want a feather from everyone roosting in this forest. Each of you give me one feather”…. (The bhikkhu did as he was told.) Then the flock of birds, thinking, ‘The bhikkhu asks for a feather, the bhikkhu wants a feather,’ left the forest. And after they were gone, they never again returned. Bhikkhus, begging is unpleasant, hinting is unpleasant even to these common animals—how much more so to human beings?”</td>

<tr><td>None of the texts define <em>sponsor</em> aside from the Vibhaṅga’s statement that the sponsor can be a man or a woman, a householder or one gone forth. The Pali term for “sponsor” here, <em>sāmika</em>, can also mean “owner,” and this has led some to suggest that this rule covers only those cases where the donor maintains ownership over the dwelling even after the bhikkhu has finished it. This, however, would create a serious gap in the rules. Suppose a donor offers to provide all the materials for a bhikkhu to build himself a large hut and to hand ownership of the hut over to the bhikkhu when it is finished as well. This is an extremely common case, and yet it would not be covered by the preceding rule, for that rule deals only with instances where the bhikkhu has to beg for his materials. If <em>sāmika</em> under this rule were confined to the restrictive sense of “owner” given above, the case would not be covered by this rule, either.</td>
<td>除了《經分別》陳述<em>資助者</em>可以是男人或女人、居士或出家人之外，沒有任何文字定義資助者。這裡的巴利語「資助者」一詞， <em>sāmika</em> ，也可以指「所有者」，這導致一些人認為，本戒條只適用於那些即使在比丘完工後，施主仍保留住處所有權的情況。然而，這將在戒條中造成嚴重漏洞。假設一位布施者願意為一位比丘提供所有材料，讓他自己建造一座大小屋，並在完工後將小屋的所有權移交給比丘。這是一個極其常見的情況，但它不會被前面的戒條涵蓋，因為該戒條只涉及比丘必須乞討材料的情況。如果本戒條下的 <em>sāmika</em> 僅限於上述「所有者」的限制性含義，則該情況也不會受到本戒條的管轄。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is evidence in the Canon, though, that the word <em>sāmika</em> can have another meaning aside from “owner.” The non-offense clauses to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0013.html#NP10">NP 10</a> use the word <em>sāmika</em> to describe a person who creates a robe-fund for a bhikkhu but does not retain ownership of the robe once it has been given to the bhikkhu, and it seems reasonable to use the word in the same sense under this rule as well. Thus a sponsor here would be anyone—man or woman, ordained or not—who underwrites the cost of building a hut in such a way that the bhikkhu does not have to beg for his materials. Thus if a bhikkhu building a hut for his own use draws entirely on funds deposited with his steward for all materials and labor, the case would come under this rule as well.</td>
<td>不過，《聖典》中有證據表明，除了「所有者」之外， <em>sāmika</em> 一詞還可以有其他意義。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0013/#NP10">《捨墮》十</a>的不犯條款使用 <em>sāmika</em> 一詞來描述為比丘創建袈裟資金但一旦將袈裟交給比丘後並不保留其所有權的人，在本戒條下使用具有同樣意義的該詞似乎也是合理的。因此，這裡的資助者可以是任何人——男人或女人，受具足戒與否——承擔建造小屋費用的人，這樣比丘就不必乞討他的材料。因此，如果比丘建造一間小屋供自己使用，其所有材料和勞力都完全由其存放在<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA">淨人</a>的資金支付，則該情況也將受此戒條管轄。</td>

<tr><td>This is just the heart of the origin story to this rule, which is one of the longest and most controversial accounts in the Vinaya. After Mettiyā Bhikkhunī made her charge, the Buddha convened a meeting of the Saṅgha to question Ven. Dabba Mallaputta. The latter, who had attained arahantship at the age of seven, responded truthfully that he could not call to mind ever having indulged in sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when awake. The Buddha then told the Saṅgha to expel Mettiyā Bhikkhunī and to interrogate (§) her instigators, after which he returned to his quarters. When the bhikkhus had expelled her, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja told them, “Friends, don’t expel Mettiyā Bhikkhunī. She hasn’t done anything wrong. She was instigated by us, who were upset, dissatisfied, and wanted to see him fall.”</td>
<td>這只是本戒條起源故事的核心，也是戒律中最長、最具爭議的記載之一。慈比丘尼提出指控後，佛陀召集僧伽會議質問沓婆摩羅子尊者。後者七歲時證得阿羅漢果，他如實回答說，即使在夢中，他也無法回憶起曾經沉迷於性交的經歷，更不用說在醒時了。然後，佛陀吩咐僧團驅逐慈比丘尼，並審問（§）她的煽動者，然後他返回自己的住處。當比丘們驅逐她時，慈和地的弟子告訴他們：「朋友們，不要驅逐慈比丘尼。她沒有做錯任何事。她是被我們慫恿的，我們心煩意亂，不滿，想看他退墮。」</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>In the centuries after the Canon was composed, however, many people have criticized and complained more about the Buddha’s treatment of Mettiyā Bhikkhunī. According to the Commentary, her expulsion was one of the controversial points dividing the bhikkhus in the Abhayagiri Vihāra from those in the Mahāvihāra in the old Sri Lankan capital of Anurādhapura. Even modern scholars have objected to the Buddha’s treatment of Mettiyā Bhikkhunī and interpret this passage as a “monkish gloss,” as if the Buddha himself were not a monk, and the entire Canon not the work of monks and nuns. The Commentary maintains that the Buddha acted as he did because he knew if he treated her less harshly, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja would never have volunteered the information that they had put her up to making the charge in the first place, and the truth would never have come out. This would have led some people to remain secretly convinced of Ven. Dabba Mallaputta’s guilt and—because he was an arahant—would have been for their long-term detriment and harm.</td>
<td>然而，在《聖典》形成後的幾個世紀裡，許多人對佛陀對待慈比丘尼的方式提出了更多的批評和抱怨。根據《義註》，她的驅逐是在斯里蘭卡舊首都<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E5%8A%AA%E6%8B%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%99%AE%E5%8B%92">阿努拉德普勒</a>的<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%84%A1%E7%95%8F%E5%B1%B1%E5%AF%BA">無畏山寺</a>比丘與<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E5%8A%AA%E6%8B%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%99%AE%E5%8B%92%E5%A4%A7%E5%AF%BA">大寺</a>比丘之間分裂的爭議點之一。甚至現代學者也反對佛陀對慈比丘尼的處理，並將這段經文解釋為「僧人的註釋」，彷彿佛陀本人不是僧人，整部《聖典》也不是僧人和尼姑的作品。《義註》認為，佛陀這樣做是因為他知道，如果他對待她不那麼嚴厲，慈和地的弟子就永遠不會自願提供他們一開始就讓她提出指控的信息，事實永遠不會出來。這會導致一些人仍然暗中相信沓婆摩羅子尊者的罪行——因為他是阿羅漢——會對他們造成長久的危害和傷害。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, what concerns us here is that at some point after this rule was formulated, the Buddha put the Saṅgha in charge of judging accusations of this sort and gave them a definite pattern to follow to ensure that their judgments would be as fair and accurate as possible. Because the Vibhaṅga and Commentary to this rule are based on this pattern, we will discuss the pattern first before dealing with the special case—unfounded charges—covered by this rule.</td>
<td>無論如何，我們在這裡關心的是，在本戒條制定後的某個時刻，佛陀讓僧團負責判斷此類指控，並給了他們一個明確的模式可遵循，以確保他們的判斷是盡可能地公平和正確。由於本戒條的《經分別》和《義註》都是基於此模式，因此我們將首先討論該模式，然後再處理本戒條所涵蓋的特殊情況——毫無根據的指控。</td>

Human nature being what it is, there are bound to be bhikkhus who neglect this responsibility, in which case the responsibility falls to the offender’s fellow bhikkhus who know of the matter to admonish him in private, if possible, or—if he is stubborn—to make a formal charge in a meeting of the Community.</td>

<tr><td>As for the other party, he may give leave, or not, depending on his assessment of the individual asking for leave, for it is possible that someone might ask for leave without any real grounds, simply to be abusive. (This interpretation follows the Burmese edition on the relevant passage, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>. In other editions, the same passage says that one is allowed to make another bhikkhu give leave after having assessed him. However, in the context of the allowance—some group-of-six bhikkhus ask leave of bhikkhus they know are pure—there seems no need to allow a bhikkhu to reflect on whether the person he plans to accuse might be pure. That is one of the accuser’s duties, as enforced by the present rule along with the following rule, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc76">Pc 76</a>, and another passage in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>. As for the case of asking leave of someone who might prove abusive, that is already covered in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.2</a>, which says that even after another bhikkhu has given leave, one should assess him before leveling a charge against him. Thus, in context, the Burmese reading makes more sense: Having been asked to give leave, one is allowed to assess the person making the request before giving him leave to speak. If we did not follow the Burmese reading here, there would be no allowance in the Vibhaṅga or the Khandhakas not to give leave to an abusive accuser.) A bhikkhu who asks for leave with no grounds—i.e., he has not seen the other party commit the offense, has heard no reliable report to that effect, and has no reason to suspect anything to that effect—incurs a dukkaṭa (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0055.html#Mv.II.16.1-3">Mv.II.16.3</a>).</td>

<tr><td>The definition of this factor—the other bhikkhu is regarded as ordained—may sound strange, but it comes from the K/Commentary, which apparently extended the principle expressed in the factor of perception, explained below, that if one perceives the bhikkhu as innocent of the charge one is making, the fact of whether he is actually innocent is irrelevant to the offense under this rule. In the same way, the K/Commentary seems to be reasoning, if one perceives the bhikkhu to be a bhikkhu, the fact of whether he is actually a bhikkhu is irrelevant to this offense. The K/Commentary makes this point for a reason: In normal cases the object of this rule will be an innocent bhikkhu, but there may be cases where a bhikkhu has actually committed a pārājika offense that no one knows about; instead of disrobing, he acts as if he were still a bhikkhu, and everyone else assumes that he still is. Yet even a “bhikkhu” of this sort would fulfill this factor as far as this rule is concerned.</td>
<td>這個因素的定義——另一位比丘被認為是受戒的——可能聽起來很奇怪，但它來自K/《義註》，它顯然擴展了感知因素中表達的原則，如下所述，如果認為被指控的比丘是無罪的，他是否實際上是無辜的這一事實與本戒條下的犯戒無關。同樣地，K/《義註》似乎在推理，如果認為該比丘是一位比丘，那麼他實際上是否是比丘這一事實與此罪行無關。K/《義註》提出這一點是有原因的：在正常情況下，本戒條的對象是無辜的比丘，但也可能有比丘實際上犯了無人知曉的《波羅夷》罪的情況；他沒有還俗，而是表現得好像他仍然是比丘，而其他人都認為他仍然是比丘。然而，就本戒條而言，即使是這樣的「比丘」也能滿足這個因素。</td>

Even though X is not really a bhikkhu, the fact that people in general assume him to be one means that he fulfills this factor.</td>

<tr><td>The wording of the training rule suggests that this factor would have to be fulfilled by impulse—aversion—together with motive—desiring the other bhikkhu’s expulsion—but the Vibhaṅga consistently conflates these two sub-factors under motive. Thus all that is needed to fulfill this factor is the desire to see the other bhikkhu expelled. If one’s motive is simply to insult him, the Vibhaṅga says that one’s actions would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc2">Pc 2</a>. If one’s motive is both to see him expelled and to insult him, one incurs both a saṅghādisesa and a pācittiya. The texts do not explicitly mention this point, but it would appear that if one has a strange sense of humor and is making the false charge as a joke with no intention of being insulting or taken seriously, one’s actions would come under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">Pc 1</a>.</td>
<td>學處的措詞表明，這個因素必須透過衝動（瞋恨）和動機（渴望驅逐另一位比丘）來滿足，但《經分別》始終將這兩個子因素合併在動機之下。因此，要滿足這個因素，所需要的只是渴望看到另一位比丘被驅逐。如果動機只是為了侮辱他，《經分別》說，該行為算在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc2">《波逸提》二</a>之下。如果動機既是為了看到他被驅逐又是為了侮辱他，那麼就會同時犯《僧殘》和《波逸提》。文本中沒有明確提及這一點，但似乎如果有一種奇怪的幽默感，並將虛假指控當作一個笑話，無意侮辱或認真對待，那麼該行為算在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc1">《波逸提》一</a>之下。</td>

<td>根據《經分別》的說法，<em>承認自己的厭惡</em>僅僅意味著承認指控是空洞的或錯誤的。因此，促使希望看到另一位比丘被驅逐的惡意程度不必太嚴重：如果只是為了好玩而想看到他被驅逐，那就滿足了這裡的意圖因素。</td>

<td>《經分別》補充說，如果有一定的事實依據，但改變了證據的狀態，懲罰是一樣的。<em>改變狀態</em>意味著，例如，說看到了某物，而實際上只是聽說或懷疑它，或者說清楚地看到了它，而實際上是模糊地看到了它。</td>

One sees them leaving the grove at approximately the same time—which could count as grounds for suspicion—but one then accuses Bhikkhu X, saying that one actually saw him having sex with Ms. Y. This would count as an unfounded charge. Another example: In the dark of the night, one sees a man stealing something from the monastery storehouse. He looks vaguely like Bhikkhu Z, but one can’t be sure. Still, one firms up one’s accusation by saying that one definitely saw Z steal the item. Again, this would count as an unfounded charge.</td>
<td>《義註》中的例子：比丘 X 到小樹林解手。 Y 女士進入同一個小樹林去拿東西。看到他們大約在同一時間離開樹林——這可以算作懷疑的理由——但隨後指責比丘 X，說實際上看到他與 Y 女士發生性關係。這算是毫無根據的指控。又如：夜深人靜時，見一人在寺庫中偷東西。他看起來有點像 Z 比丘，但無法確定。儘管如此，還是證實了自己的指控，說確實看到了 Z 偷了這件物品。同樣，這算是毫無根據的指控。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary states that for an unfounded charge to count under this rule, it must state explicitly (a) the precise act the accused supposedly committed (e.g., having sexual intercourse, getting a woman to have an abortion) or (b) that the accused is guilty of a pārājika, or (c) that the accused is no longer a true bhikkhu. If one simply says or does something that might imply that the accused is no longer a bhikkhu—e.g., refusing to show him respect in line with his seniority—that does not yet count as a charge.</td>
<td>《義註》指出，要根據本戒條提出毫無根據的指控，必須明確說明 (a) 被指控者據稱犯下的具體行為（例如，發生性交、讓婦女墮胎）或 (b) 被指控者犯有《波羅夷》罪，或 (c) 被指控者不再是真正的比丘。如果只是說或做了一些可能暗示被指控者不再是比丘的事情——例如，拒絕根據他的戒臘向他表示尊重——那還不算是一項指控。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds that charging a bhikkhu with having committed an equivalent or derived pārājika, as discussed in the conclusion to the preceding chapter, would fulfill this factor as well. For instance, if one makes an unfounded charge accusing Bhikkhu A of having killed his father before his ordination, that would constitute a full offense here. The Vibhaṅga makes no mention of these equivalent pārājikas under this rule, but the Great Standards can be used to justify their inclusion here.</td>
<td>《義註》補充說，指控比丘犯了同等或衍生的《波羅夷》罪（如上一章結論中所討論的那樣）也可以滿足這一因素。例如，如果毫無根據地指控比丘 A 在受具足戒前殺害了他的父親，那麼這裡就構成了完全違犯。《經分別》沒有提及本戒條下的這些同等的《波羅夷》罪，但是《四大教示》可以用來證明它們包含在這裡是合理的。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>All of the charges given as examples in the Vibhaṅga are expressed directly to the accused—“I saw you commit a pārājika offense,” “I heard you commit a pārājika offense”—and the Commentary concludes from this that the full offense occurs only when one makes the charge in the accused’s presence, in line with the pattern for admonition discussed above. To make an unfounded charge behind the accused’s back, it states, incurs a dukkaṭa.</td>
<td>《經分別》中作為例子給出的所有指控都是直接向被指控者表達的——「我看到你犯了《波羅夷》罪」，「我聽說你犯了《波羅夷》罪」——《義註》由此得出結論，只有當被指控者在場的情況下提出指控時，才會構成完整違犯，這符合上述教誡的模式。它指出，在被指控者背後提出毫無根據的指控，犯《突吉羅》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>There is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to indicate that the Commentary is wrong here, aside from the consideration that—because the charge is unfounded—it could entail a pācittiya for deliberate lying. Some people, however, have objected to the Commentary’s position here, saying that a dukkaṭa or even a pācittiya is a very light penalty for backhanded character assassination. Nevertheless, we should remember that the correct procedures for making an accusation require that an earnest charge be made in the presence of the accused. If a bhikkhu spreads gossip about another bhikkhu, accusing him of having committed a pārājika, he should be asked whether he has taken up the matter with the accused. If he hasn’t, he should be told to speak to the accused before he speaks to anyone else. If he says that he doesn’t feel qualified or that he fears the accused will retaliate, he should be told to take the matter up with the bhikkhus who will be responsible for calling a meeting of the Community. If he refuses to do that, he shouldn’t be listened to.</td>
<td>《經分別》中沒有任何內容表明《義註》在這裡是錯誤的，除了考慮到——因為指控是沒有根據的——它可能會因故意撒謊而犯《波逸提》罪。然而，有些人反對《義註》在此的立場，稱《突吉羅》甚至《波逸提》對於隱含的人格謀殺來說是一種非常輕微的懲罰。然而，我們應該記住，提出指控的正確程序要求在被指控者在場的情況下提出認真的指控。如果一位比丘散佈關於另一位比丘的流言蜚語，指控他犯了《波羅夷》罪，應該詢問他是否已與被指控者討論此事。如果他沒有，應該告訴他在與其他人交談之前先與被指控者交談。如果他說他覺得自己沒有資格，或者擔心被指控者會報復，那麼他應該被告知向負責召開僧團會議的比丘們提出此事。如果他拒絕這樣做，就不應該聽取他的意見。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>For some reason, the Commentary maintains that a charge made in writing does not count, although a charge made by gesture—e.g., pointing at the accused when one is asked who committed the pārājika—does. Perhaps in those days written charges were regarded as too cowardly to take seriously.</td>
<td>出於某種原因，《義註》認為，以書面形式提出的指控不算數，但透過手勢提出的指控（例如，當被問及誰犯了《波羅夷》時指著被指控者）則算在內。也許在當時，書面指控被認為太懦弱而無法認真對待。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The rule seems to require that the accuser confess that he was acting out of depraved impulses, although the Vibhaṅga states that this means simply that he admits the charge was a lie. The Commentary states further that here the rule is showing the point where the rest of the Community knows that the bhikkhu making the charge is guilty of a saṅghādisesa: He actually committed the offense when he made the charge.</td>
<td>本戒條似乎要求原指控者承認他的行為是出於墮落的衝動，儘管《經分別》指出這僅意味著他承認指控是謊言。《義註》進一步指出，這裡的戒條表明，僧團的其他成員都知道提出指控的比丘犯了《僧殘》罪：實際上他在提出指控時犯了戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The K/Commentary adds “result” as a further factor to the offense under this rule, saying that the accused must immediately understand the charge—but nothing in the Vibhaṅga supports this added factor.</td>

For instance, one sees him get into an argument with Bhikkhu Z and in a fit of anger give Z a blow to the head. Z goes unconscious, falls to the floor, and suffers a severe concussion resulting in death. Because Y’s intention was simply to hurt him, not to kill him, he incurs only a pācittiya. If one realizes the nature of Y’s intention and the fact that the penalty is a pācittiya, and yet accuses him of having committed a pārājika, one would incur a saṅghādisesa under this rule. For ease of remembrance, this use of a ploy can be called “same person, different offense.”</td>
<td>1）以犯戒作為手段的例子：看到比丘 Y 實際上犯了戒。儘管認為這是一種較輕的犯戒，但卻將這種指控放大到了《波羅夷》。例如，看到他與比丘 Z 發生爭執，一怒之下就打了 Z 的頭部。 Z 失去知覺，摔倒在地，並遭受嚴重腦震盪導致死亡。因為 Y 的意圖只是傷害他，而不是殺死他，所以他只犯《波逸提》。如果知道到 Y 的意圖的本質以及懲罰是《波逸提》的事實，但仍指控他犯了《波羅夷》，那麼根據本戒條，就會犯《僧殘》。為了便於記憶，這種手法的使用可以稱為「同人異罪」。</td>

For instance, X and Y are both very tall. Late at night one sees X—knowing that it is X—stealing tools from the monastery storeroom. One has a grudge against Y and so accuses him of being the thief, saying, “I saw this big tall guy stealing the tools, and he looked just like you. It must have been you.” For ease of remembrance, this use of a ploy can be called “same offense, different person.”</td>

In other words, if—having seen X engage in lustful contact with a woman—one then accuses Bhikkhu Y, who shares the same family name with X, of engaging in sexual intercourse with the woman, the case would apparently come under this rule.</td>
<td>沒有任何文本提到雙重手段的場景，即「異人異罪」，但從《經分別》定義<em>與此相關的問題</em>的方式來看，雙重手段也符合此定義。換言之，如果看到 X 與女性發生淫穢的接觸，然後指控與 X 同姓的比丘 Y 與該女性發生性關係，那麼該情況顯然會算在本戒條之下。</td>

<tr><td>A case that would <em>not</em> come under this rule is one based on seeing or hearing Y commit an action that bears some resemblance to an offense but is actually not. For instance, one overhears him teaching Vinaya to some new bhikkhus and quoting, by way of illustration, a few of the statements that would count as claims of superior human states. Because this does not constitute an offense, there is no issue <em>(adhikaraṇa)</em> pertaining otherwise that can be used as a ploy. In shorthand terms, this would count as “same person, no offense.” If, realizing the context, one later accuses him of having violated <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr4">Pr 4</a>, the accusation would count as an unfounded charge and so would come under the preceding rule.</td>
<td><em>不</em>屬於本戒條的情況是基於看到或聽到 Y 實施與犯戒有些相似但實際上並非犯戒的行為。例如，無意中聽到他向一些新比丘教授戒律，並以舉例的方式引用了一些可以視為上人法主張的陳述。因為這並不構成犯戒，所以不存在可以用作手段的與此相關的問題（<em>adhikaraṇa</em>）。簡而言之，這將被視為「同人無罪」。如果了解此來龍去脈，後來指控他違反了<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#Pr4">《波羅夷》四</a>，則該指控將被視為毫無根據的指控，因此將算在前一戒條之下。</td>

<tr><td>The remaining explanations for this rule are exactly the same as those for the preceding rule, except that in the non-offense clauses the Vibhaṅga states that if one makes a charge—or gets someone else to make a charge—against the accused based on what one actually perceives, there is no offense even if the issue turns out to pertain otherwise. For instance, from the examples already given: One sees X stealing tools in the dark and, because of his resemblance to Y, actually thinks Y is the thief. One sees Y give a fatal blow to Z and actually thinks that Y’s intention was to kill Z. In either of these cases, if one then accuses Y of a pārājika offense, one incurs no penalty regardless of how the case comes out, although—as under the preceding rule—one should be careful to ask Y’s leave before making the charge and to have no intention of insulting him.</td>
<td>本戒條的其餘解釋與前一條戒條的解釋完全相同，除了在不犯條款中，《經分別》規定，如果根據自己的實際看法對被指控者提出指控（或讓其他人提出指控），即使事實證明問題並非如此，也沒有犯戒。例如，從已經給出的例子來看：看到 X 在黑暗中偷工具，並且由於他與 Y 相似，竟然認為 Y 是小偷。看到 Y 對 Z 給予致命一擊，竟然認為 Y 的意圖是殺死 Z。在這兩種情況中的任何一種情況下，如果指控 Y 犯有《波羅夷》罪，則無論情況結果如何，都不會受到處罰，儘管——與前面的戒條一樣，在提出指控之前，應該小心地徵求 Y 的許可，並且不要有意侮辱他。</td>
