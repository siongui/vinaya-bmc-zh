<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>這個術語的意思是「讓僧團參與初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和後續 <em>(sesa)</em> 行為」。它源於這樣一個事實，即僧團是最初要求違反此類戒條的比丘接受懲罰（ <em>mānatta</em> ，贖罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，別住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他沒有正確執行，則隨後重新施加懲罰，最終當他正確執行後解除懲罰。此處有十三個學處（訓練戒條），前九個在違反時即犯《僧殘》，最後四個只有在違反者作為僧伽羯磨的一部分被訶責三次之後才犯《僧殘》。</td>

<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">爾時，施越尊者過著不滿的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形體枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脈悉現。優陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。一見到他，就對他說：『友！施越！，你為什麼形體枯瘦…筋脈悉現？難道你對梵行生活不滿意？』</td>

<tr><td>“‘In that case, eat as you like and sleep as you like and bathe as you like; and having eaten, slept, and bathed as you like, when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails the mind, emit semen having attacked (!) with your hand.’</td>
<td>「『既然如此，想吃就吃，想睡就睡，想沐浴就沐浴；隨心所欲地飲食、睡眠、沐浴，當不滿生起、欲念侵襲心時，就用手攻擊（！）射出精液。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘But is it okay to do that?’</td>
<td>「『但是這樣做可以嗎？』</td>

<tr><td>“‘Of course. I do it myself.’</td>

<tr><td>“So then Ven. Seyyasaka ate as he liked and slept as he liked… and when dissatisfaction arose and lust assailed his mind, he would emit semen having attacked with his hand. Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「於是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，他就會用手攻擊射出精液。然後沒多久，他就變得很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。因此，他的朋友比丘們對他說：『以前，朋友施越，你形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。但現在的你很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。難道是你在吃藥？』</td>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒條的大綱形式是最容易解釋的戒條之一。然而，就其細節而言，它是最複雜的之一，不僅因為該主題是一個敏感問題，而且因為《義註》在對構成完整違犯的三個因素中的兩個的解釋中偏離了《經分別》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>這三個因素是結果、意圖和努力：由於有意的努力而導致精液的排出。當這三個因素都存在時，該違犯就是《僧殘》。如果最後兩項——意圖和努力——都存在，那麼該違犯就是《偷蘭遮》。任何單一因素或兩個因素的任何其他組合——即沒有做出肉體的努力的意圖和結果，或沒有意圖的努力和結果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出結果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解釋一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒條所涵蓋的意圖和努力類型時，有必要知道它們的目的是什麼，也因為結果是《經分別》和《義註》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<td><strong>結果</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，精液有十種顏色，這種分類源自古印度醫學的診斷實踐，醫生會檢查男性患者的射精，以此作為診斷其健康狀況的一種方式。在根據這十種顏色的精液提出了一長系列的輪子之後，《經分別》得出了一個簡單的結論：精液的顏色和品質與犯戒無關。這表明，接受過輸精管結紮手術的比丘仍然可以犯下這條戒條，因為他仍然可以在性高潮時排出進入精液的各種成分（僅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>儘管《經分別》補充說，當精液「從基底落下」時，精液就會被排出，但它並沒有詳細討論這一點。關於這種情況在性刺激過程中何時發生，《義註》討論了三種觀點。儘管它的討論是以當時所理解的射精生理學為框架的，但它的結論很明確：當「使整個身體搖晃時，它被釋放並下降到尿道」時，精液從其基底移動—換句話說，在性高潮的時候。《義註》進一步解釋說，精液在進入尿道時會從其基底落下，因為從那時起，該過程是不可逆轉的。因此，如果性刺激的過程達到了這一點，即使在性高潮時試圖透過捏住陰莖末端來阻止精液離開身體，結果因素也已經滿足。一旦進入尿道，它就已經從基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否離開身體並不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>儘管一些《複註》的再註釋提出了比《義註》更謹慎的觀點，即當射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺產生少量透明鹼性液體時，精液就被視為從其基底落下。《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明《義註》是錯誤的。</td>

<tr><td><strong>Intention</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines <em>intentionally</em> as “having willed, having made the decision knowingly and consciously.” The Commentary explains these terms as follows: <em>Having willed</em> means having willed, having planned, with the intention of enjoying bringing about an emission. <em>Having made the decision</em> means having summoned up a reckless mind state, “crushing” through the power of an attack. (These are the same terms it uses to explain the same phrase under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">Pc 61</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">Pc 77</a>. The meaning is that one is not simply toying with the idea. One has definitely made up one’s mind to overcome all hesitation by aggressively setting upon an action aimed at causing emission.) <em>Knowingly</em> means knowing that, “I am making an exertion”—which the Sub-commentary explains as knowing that, “I am making an exertion for the sake of an emission.” <em>Consciously</em> means being aware that one’s efforts are bringing about an emission of semen.</td>
<td>《經分別》將<em>故意</em>定義為「有意願，明知地而且有意識地做出決定」。《義註》對這些術語的解釋如下：<em>有意願</em>，意思是已經願意、已經計劃、並且意圖享受射精。<em>做出決定</em>，意思是喚起了不顧後果的精神狀態，以攻擊之力「碾碎」。（這些是它用來解釋<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr3">《波羅夷》三</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc61">《波逸提》六一</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0023.html#Pc77">《波逸提》七七</a>中相同措辭的相同術語。意思是，不僅玩弄這個想法。而是已經肯定地下定決心，克服所有猶豫，積極地採取旨在引起射精的行動。）<em>明知</em>意思是知道「我正在努力」——《複註》將其解釋為知道「我正在為了射精而努力」。<em>有意識</em>意思是意識到自己的努力正在導致精液的排出。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary’s definition of “having willed” is where it deviates from the Vibhaṅga’s discussion of the factor of intention. The Vibhaṅga, throughout its analysis, expresses this factor simply as “aiming at causing an emission,” and it lists ten possible motives for wanting to bring the emission about:</td>

<tr><td>Each of these motives, the Vibhaṅga says, fulfills the factor of intention here. Thus for the Commentary to limit the question of “deliberate intention” strictly to the enjoyment of the act of bringing about an emission (numbers 2 and 10 in the Vibhaṅga’s list) has no basis in the Canon. This means that the factor of intention under this rule is defined by deliberateness and immediate aim—causing an emission of semen—regardless of impulse or motive.</td>
<td>《經分別》說，這些動機中的每一個都滿足了這裡的意圖因素。因此，《義註》將「故意」問題嚴格限制為享受帶來射精的行為（《經分別》列表中的第2和10號）在《聖典》中是沒有根據的。這意味著本戒條下的意圖因素是由故意和直接目標（導致精液排出）定義的，無論衝動或動機如何。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga defines four types of effort that fulfill this factor: A bhikkhu causes an emission making an effort (1) at an internal object, (2) at an external object, (3) at both an internal and an external object, or (4) by shaking his pelvis in the air. It then goes on to explain these terms: The internal object is one’s own living body. External objects can either be animate or inanimate objects. The third type of effort involves a combination of the first two, and the fourth covers cases when one makes one’s penis erect (“workable”) by making an effort in the air.</td>
<td>《經分別》定義了滿足此因素的四種類型的努力：比丘造成射精藉由努力於：（1）內在所緣，（2）外在所緣，（3）內在所緣和外在所緣，或（4）透過在空中搖動骨盆。然後它繼續解釋這些術語：內在所緣是一個人自己的生命體。外在所緣可以是有生命的或無生命的所緣。第三種類型的努力涉及前兩種的組合，第四種涵蓋了透過在空中努力使陰莖勃起（「可行」）的情況。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The extremely general nature of these definitions gives the impression that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga wanted them to cover every imaginable type of bodily effort aimed at arousing oneself sexually, and this impression is borne out by the wide variety of cases covered in the Vinīta-vatthu. They include, among others, a bhikkhu who squeezes his penis with his fist, one who rubs his penis with his thumb, one who rubs his penis against his bed, one who inserts his penis into sand, one who bathes against the current in a stream, one who rubs his preceptor’s back in the bathing room, one who gets an erection from the friction of his thighs and robes while walking along, one who has his belly heated in the bathing room, and one who stretches his body. In each of these cases, if the bhikkhu aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.</td>
<td>這些定義極其籠統的性質給人的印象是，《經分別》的編撰者希望它們涵蓋所有可以想像到的旨在喚起性欲的身體努力類型，而這種印象在《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中涵蓋的各種案例中得到了證實。其中包括一位比丘用拳頭擠壓他的陰莖，一位比丘用拇指摩擦他的陰莖，一位比丘用床摩擦他的陰莖，一位將他的陰莖插入沙子中，一位<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a08">在水流中逆流沐浴</a>。一位是在浴房裡摩擦戒師的背部，一位是走路時大腿和袈裟摩擦而勃起的，一位是在浴房裡加熱腹部的，一位是伸展身體的。在上述每一種情況下，如果比丘目的在於射精並成功，他就會犯《僧殘》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Vinīta-vatthu also includes a case in which a bhikkhu, desiring to cause an emission, orders a novice to take hold of his (the bhikkhu’s) penis. He gets his emission and a saṅghādisesa to boot, which shows that getting someone else to make the effort for one fulfills the factor of effort here. Under the factor of consent, below, we will discuss a similar case from the Vinīta-vatthu to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a> which indicates that simply lying still while allowing someone else to bring one to an orgasm fulfills the factor of effort here as well.</td>
<td>《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》還包括一個例子，一位比丘想要射精，<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0163a07">命令一位沙彌抓住他的（比丘的）陰莖</a>。他得到了他的射精和《僧殘》，這表明讓別人為自己付出努力就滿足了這裡的努力因素。在下面的同意因素下，我們將討論從<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>的《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的一個類似案例，該案例表明，僅僅只是不動地躺著，同時允許別人使自己達到高潮，也滿足了這裡的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In discussing the factor of effort, though, the Commentary adds an additional sub-factor: that the effort must be directed at one’s own penis. If this were so, then a bhikkhu who succeeded in causing an emission by stimulating any of the erogenous zones of his body aside from his penis would incur no penalty. The Commentary itself actually makes this point, and the Sub-commentary seconds it, although the V/Sub-commentary says that such a bhikkhu would incur a dukkaṭa—what it bases this opinion on, it doesn’t say: perhaps a misreading of the Case of the Sleeping Novice, which we will discuss below.</td>
<td>然而，在討論努力因素時，《義註》增加了一個額外的子因素：努力必須針對自己的陰莖。如果是這樣的話，那麼比丘如果透過刺激身體上除陰莖以外的任何性感帶而成功地導致射精，就不會受到懲罰。《義註》本身實際上提出了這一點，而《複註》也同意這一點，儘管V/《複註》說這樣的比丘會犯《突吉羅》—它並沒有說明此觀點基於什麼：也許是對<strong>睡眠沙彌案例</strong>的誤讀，我們將在下面討論。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>At any rate, the Commentary in adding this last factor runs up against a number of cases in the Vinīta-vatthu in which the effort does not involve the penis: the bhikkhu warming his belly, the bhikkhu rubbing his preceptor’s back, a bhikkhu having his thighs massaged, and others. The Commentary deals with these cases by rewriting them, stating in most cases that the effort somehow had to involve the penis. This in itself is questionable, but when the Commentary actually contradicts the Vinīta-vatthu in the case of the bhikkhu who warms his belly, saying that this sort of effort could not involve an offense at all, even if one aims at and succeeds in causing an emission, the commentators have moved beyond the realm of commenting into the realm of rewriting the rule.</td>
<td>無論如何，《義註》在添加這最後一個因素時遭遇到了《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的許多案例，其中努力不涉及陰莖：比丘溫暖他的腹部，比丘摩擦他的戒師的背部，比丘讓他的大腿被按摩，等等。《義註》透過改寫來處理這些案例，指出在大多數情況下，努力必須以某種方式涉及陰莖。這本身是有問題的，但是當《義註》實際上與《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中比丘溫暖腹部的案例相矛盾時，說這種努力根本不涉及犯戒，即使一個人的目的在於射精並成功，註釋者已經超越了註釋領域，進入了改寫戒條的領域。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As stated in the Introduction, we have to go on the assumption that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga knew the crucial factors of each offense well enough to know what is and is not an offense, and were careful enough to include all the relevant facts when describing the precedents in the Vinīta-vatthu in order to show how the Buddha arrived at his judgments. Because the Commentary’s position—adding the extra factor that the physical effort has to involve one’s own penis—directly contradicts the Vibhaṅga on this point, the extra factor cannot stand.</td>
<td>如同<strong>引言</strong>中所述，我們必須繼續假設，《經分別》的編纂者充分了解每種犯戒的關鍵因素，知道什麼是犯戒，什麼不是犯戒，並且在描述《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中的先例時足夠小心，包括所有相關事實，以表明佛陀如何得出他的判斷。因為《義註》的立場——增加了身體努力必須涉及自己的陰莖這一額外因素——在這一點上直接與《經分別》相矛盾，所以這個額外因素不能成立。</td>

<td>「有一次，某個比丘抓住了一個熟睡的沙彌的陰莖。他的精液被射出。他感到良心不安…。『比丘，非《僧殘》，乃《突吉羅》』」</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The issue here is whose semen was emitted. Pali syntax, unlike English, doesn’t give us a clue, for there is no syntactical rule that the pronoun in one sentence should refer to the subject of the preceding sentence. There are many cases under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr3">Pr 3</a> that follow the form, “A stone badly held by the bhikkhu standing above hit the bhikkhu standing below on the head. The bhikkhu died. He felt conscience-stricken.” In these cases it is obvious from the context within the story which bhikkhu died and which one felt conscience-stricken, while with the sleeping novice we have to look for the context in other parts of the Vibhaṅga.</td>
<td>這裡的問題是誰的精液被排出了。巴利語法與英語不同，沒有給我們任何線索，因為沒有語法規則要求一個句子中的代名詞應該指前一個句子的主詞。<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr3">《波羅夷》三</a>中有許多案例遵循這樣的形式：「站在上面的比丘拙劣地握住一塊石頭，擊中了站在下面的比丘的頭部。比丘死了。他感到良心受到譴責。」在這些情況下，從故事的上下文中可以明顯看出哪個比丘死了，哪個比丘感到良心受到打擊，而對於睡眠的沙彌，我們必須在《經分別》的其他部分尋找上下文。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If the bhikkhu was the one who emitted semen, then perhaps there is a contradiction in the Vibhaṅga, and the Commentary is justified in saying that the effort must involve one’s penis, for otherwise the case would seem to fulfill the Vibhaṅga’s general definition for the factor of effort: The bhikkhu is making an effort at an outside body and has an emission. Following the general pattern of the rule, he would incur a saṅghādisesa if he intended emission, and no penalty at all if he didn’t. Yet—deviating from the standard pattern for the Vinīta-vatthu cases—the Buddha does not ask whether he aimed at emitting semen, and simply gives the bhikkhu a dukkaṭa, which suggests an inconsistency.</td>
<td>如果比丘是射出精液的人，那麼《經分別》中也許存在矛盾，而《義註》說努力必須涉及自己的陰莖是合理的，否則這種情況似乎滿足了《經分別》對努力因素的一般定義：比丘對對外部的身體施加努力並且射出精液。按照戒條的一般模式，如果他意圖射精，就會犯《僧殘》，如果他沒有意圖射精，則不會受到任何懲罰。然而，與《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》案例的標準模式不同的是，佛陀並沒有問他是否旨在射精，而只是給了比丘《突吉羅》，這表明了不一致。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If, however, the novice was the one who emitted, there is no inconsistency at all: The bhikkhu incurs his dukkaṭa for making lustful bodily contact with another man (see the discussion under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg2">Sg 2</a>, below), and the case is included here to show that the full offense under this rule concerns instances where one makes <em>oneself</em> emit semen, and not where one makes others emit. (Other than this case, there is nothing in the rule or the Vibhaṅga that expressly makes this point. The rule simply mentions bringing about the emission of semen, without explicitly mentioning whose. This would explain the bhikkhu’s uncertainty as to whether or not he had committed a saṅghādisesa.) And the reason there is no mention of whether or not the bhikkhu intended to emit semen is because—as it comes under another rule—it is irrelevant to the case.</td>
<td>然而，如果沙彌是射出精液的人，則根本沒有矛盾：比丘因與另一個男人進行淫蕩的身體接觸而犯《突吉羅》（參見下面<a class="reference external" href="#sg2">《僧殘》二</a>的討論），這個案例被包括在這裡，以顯示本戒條下的完全違犯涉及一個人使<em>自己</em>射出精液的情況，而不是使他人射出精液的情況。（除了這個例子之外，戒條或《經分別》中沒有任何內容明確說明這一點。戒條只是提到導致精液的排出，而沒有明確提及是誰的。這可以解釋比丘不確定自己是否犯《僧殘》。）之所以沒有提及比丘是否有意射精，是因為——它屬於另一條戒條——與本案例無關。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Thus, inasmuch as the second reading—the novice was the one who had an emission—does no violence to the rest of the Vibhaṅga, it seems to be the preferable one. If this was the case that led the commentators to add their extra factor, we can see that they misread it and that the Vibhaṅga’s original definition for the factor of effort still stands: Any bodily effort made at one’s own body, at another body or physical object, at both, or any effort made in the air—like shaking one’s pelvis or stretching one’s body—fulfills the factor of effort here.</td>
<td>因此，由於第二種讀法——沙彌是射精的人——對《經分別》的其餘部分沒有衝突，所以它似乎是更好的讀法。如果正是這種情況導致註釋者添加他們的額外因素，我們可以看到他們誤讀了它，而《經分別》對努力因素的原始定義仍然有效：對自己的身體、對另一個身體或身體對象，或對兩者皆是，還是在空中所做的任何努力——比如搖動一個人的骨盆或伸展一個人的身體——所做出的任何身體努力，都滿足了這裡的努力因素。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>One case that does <em>not</em> fulfill the factor of effort, according to the Vinīta-vatthu, is when one is filled with lust and stares at the private parts of a woman or girl. In the case dealing with this contingency, the bhikkhu emits semen, but again the Buddha does not ask whether he intended to. Instead, he lays down a separate rule, imposing a dukkaṭa for staring lustfully at a woman’s private parts. This suggests that efforts with one’s eyes do not count as bodily efforts under this saṅghādisesa rule, for otherwise the penalty would have been a saṅghādisesa if the bhikkhu had intended emission, and no offense—not a dukkaṭa—if he hadn’t. And this also suggests that the dukkaṭa under this separate rule holds regardless of intention or result. The Commentary adds that this dukkaṭa applies also to staring lustfully at the genitals of a female animal or at the area of a fully-clothed woman’s body where her sexual organ is, thinking, “Her sexual organ is there.” At present we would impose the penalty on a bhikkhu who stares lustfully at a woman’s private parts in a pornographic photograph.</td>
<td>根據《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》，一種<em>不</em>滿足努力因素的情況是，當一個人充滿欲望並盯著女人或女孩的私處時。在處理這種可能發生的情況時，比丘射出精液，但佛陀並沒有問他是否有意這樣做。相反地，他制定了一條單獨的戒條，對<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0164a02">充滿欲望地凝視女性私處，處以《突吉羅》</a>。這表明，在本《僧殘》戒條下，用眼睛做的努力不算作身體的努力，否則，如果比丘有意射精，就會受到《僧殘》的懲罰；如果他沒有無意，則沒有犯戒，而不是《突吉羅》。這也表明，無論意圖或結果如何，這條單獨戒條下的《突吉羅》都成立。《義註》補充說，這種《突吉羅》也適用於充滿欲望地凝視雌性動物的生殖器，或盯著穿著衣服的女性身體的性器官所在的區域，心想：「她的性器官就在那裡。」目前，我們會對在色情照片中充滿欲望地凝視女性私處的比丘施以此懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As we will see under the non-offense clauses, there is no offense in a nocturnal emission. The Commentary, however, discusses the question of conscious efforts made prior to sleep aimed at a nocturnal emission, and arrives at the following verdicts: If a bhikkhu, “usurped” with lust while lying down, grabs his penis with his fist or thighs and drops off to sleep maintaining that position in hopes of inducing an emission, he incurs the full offense if the emission takes place. If, however, he suppresses his “lust-usurpation” by reflecting on the foulness of the body and then dozes off with a pure mind, he incurs no offense even if an emission later occurs. The analysis here seems to be that the bhikkhu’s change of mind would separate the emission from the earlier effort enough so that it would not be regarded as a direct result of that effort. The Sub-commentary adds that, in addition to suppressing the lust in his mind, he also has to discontinue his effort to be free of an offense in this way. And both texts have to be qualified by saying that the “no offense” would apply only to the emission, for the earlier intentional effort would incur a thullaccaya.</td>
<td>正如我們將在不犯條款中看到的，遺精並不構成犯戒。然而，《義註》討論了在睡眠前為了遺精而有意識地努力的問題，並得出以下結論：如果比丘在躺下時被欲望「侵占」，用拳頭或大腿抓住他的陰莖，入睡時保持該姿勢以期引起遺精，如果發生遺精，他將完全違犯此戒條。然而，如果他透過反思身體的不淨來抑制「欲望篡奪」，然後以清淨的心入睡，即使後來發生遺精，他也不會犯戒。這裡的分析似乎是，比丘改變心意，會將射精與先前的努力充分分開，這樣它就不會被視為該努力的直接結果。《複註》又說，除了抑制內心的欲望之外，他還必須停止他的努力而免於以這種方式犯戒。這兩篇文本都必須加以限定，即「不犯」僅適用於射精，因為更早之前的故意努力會犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>

In both cases the bhikkhu lets her go ahead, and the Buddha says that he incurs a saṅghādisesa in doing so. The commentaries treat the cases as self-evident and offer no extra details. Thus, given the facts as we have them, it would seem that consent under this rule can be expressed physically simply by letting the act happen. A bhikkhu who acquiesces mentally when someone tries and succeeds in making him emit semen is not absolved from the full offense here even if he otherwise lies perfectly still throughout the event.</td>

Otherwise, one would incur a thullaccaya simply for moving one’s legs. <em>Sensual fever</em>, here, probably refers to the desire to cause an emission, for there are several spots where the Commentary discusses bhikkhus who stimulate an erection simply for the enjoyment of the contact rather than to cause an emission, and the judgment is that they incur no penalty, even if an emission does inadvertently result.</td>
<td>在討論一位大腿肥大的比丘，只要走路就勃起的案例時，《義註》提到，如果在這種情況下發現欲「燒」，必須立即停止行走，並開始觀照身體的不淨，以便在繼續前進之前淨化內心。否則，僅僅因為移動雙腿就會招致《偷蘭遮》。這裡的<em>欲燒</em>可能是指想要引起射精的欲望，因為《義註》中有好幾處討論了比丘刺激勃起的原因，他們只是為了享受接觸的樂趣而不是為了引起射精，而判決結果是，即使無意中造成了射精，他們也不會受到懲罰。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Aside from the thullaccaya, the Vibhaṅga assigns no other derived offenses under this rule. A bhikkhu who has an ejaculation while thinking sensual thoughts but without making any physical effort to cause it, incurs no penalty regardless of whether the idea crosses his mind that he would like to have an emission, and regardless of whether he enjoys it when it occurs. However, the Commentary notes here that even though there is no offense involved, one should not let oneself be overcome by sensual thoughts in this way. This point is borne out by the famous simile that occurred to Prince Siddhattha before his Awakening and that later, as Buddha, he related to a number of listeners:</td>
<td>除了《偷蘭遮》之外，《經分別》在本戒條下沒有指定任何其他衍生違犯。比丘在想性欲念頭時射精，但沒有付出任何身體努力來導致射精，無論他的心中是否有想要射精的念頭，也無論當射精發生時他是否享受它，都不會受到懲罰。然而，《義註》在此指出，即使沒有犯戒，也不應該這樣讓自己被欲念所征服。悉達多太子在成佛之前，後來成為佛陀時，對許多聽眾講了一個著名的比喻，證實了這一點：</td>

<tr><td>The Commentary notes that some interpreters had taken the idiomatic term in the rule translated as, “while dreaming (<em>supinantā</em>),” and read it as a compound meaning literally “at the end of a dream (<em>supin’antā</em>),” thus opening an allowance for intentional effort and emission when awakening from a soon-to-be-wet dream. However, the Commentary goes on to rule out this overly literal interpretation, stating that what happens in the mind while one is sleeping falls in the bounds of the Abhidhamma, but what happens after one awakens falls within the bounds of the Vinaya; and that there is no such thing as a misdeed performed when one is in a “non-negligible” state of mind that does not count as an offense. (<em>Non-negligible</em>, according to the Sub-commentary, means “normal.”)</td>
<td>《義註》指出，一些解釋者將戒條中的慣用術語翻譯為「做夢時 (<em>supinantā</em>)」，並將其解讀為複合詞，字面意思是「在夢的結尾 (<em>supin'antā</em>)」，從而開緣了當從即將遺精的春夢中醒來時，允許有意識的努力和泄精。然而，《義註》接著排除了這種過於字面的解釋，指出睡著時內心發生的事情屬於阿毘達摩的範圍，而睡醒後發生的事情則屬於戒律的範圍。當一個人處於「不可忽略」的心態時，任何不端行為都算犯戒。（根據《複註》，<em>不可忽略</em>的意思是「正常」。）</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>In making the exception for what happens while asleep, the Buddha states that even though there may be the intention to cause an emission, it doesn’t count. The Commentary goes on to say, however, that if a bhikkhu fully awakens in the course of a wet dream, he should lie still and be extremely careful not to make a move that would fulfill the factor of effort under this rule. If the process has reached the point where it is irreversible and the ejaculation occurs spontaneously, he incurs no penalty regardless of whether he enjoys it. And as the Commentary quotes from the Kurundī, one of the ancient Sinhalese commentaries on which it is based, if he wakes up in the course of a wet dream and grabs hold of his penis to prevent the ejaculation from soiling his robes or bedding, there is no offense.</td>
<td>在對睡眠時發生的情況進行例外處理時，佛陀指出，即使可能有導致泄精的意圖，但這不算數。然而，《義註》接著說，如果比丘在春夢中完全醒來，他應該靜靜地躺著，並且要非常小心，不要做出會滿足本戒條下努力因素的舉動。如果這個過程已經達到不可逆轉的地步並且射精自然發生，那麼無論他是否享受它，他都不會受到懲罰。正如《義註》引用的《Kurundī》（這是其所依據的古代僧伽羅註釋之一）中的那樣，如果他在春夢中醒來並抓住他的陰莖以防止射精弄髒他的袈裟或床上用品，那麼並沒有犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>However, the Commentary’s two cases concerning nocturnal emissions, mentioned above, indicate that if a nocturnal emission occurs after a bhikkhu made a fully intentional effort toward an emission before falling asleep, he would incur the full offense under this rule unless the effort and intent were clearly stopped with a clear change of heart while he was still awake. This is because all three factors under this rule would be fully present: a conscious, unhesitating decision to cause an emission; a conscious effort based on that decision; and the resulting emission. Whether or not one was conscious while it occurred is of no account.</td>
<td>然而，上述《義註》中關於遺精的兩個案例表明，如果比丘在入睡前完全有意地努力泄精，之後發生遺精，那麼他將完全違犯本戒條下，除非在他還醒著的時候，由於心意的明顯改變而明顯地停止了努力和意圖。這是因為本戒條下的所有三個因素都將完全存在：有意識地、毫不猶豫地決定引起泄精；基於該決定的有意識的努力；以及由此產生的泄精。事情發生時一個人是否有意識並不重要。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga explains the term <em>overcome with lust</em> as meaning “impassioned, desiring, a mind bound by attraction.” <em>Altered</em>, it says, can refer in general to one of three states of mind—passion, aversion, or delusion—but here it refers specifically to passion.</td>
<td>《經分別》將「<em>被貪欲所征服</em>」一詞解釋為「充滿激情、渴望、被吸引力束縛的心」。 它說，「變易」一般可以指三種心理狀態之一──貪、瞋或癡──但這裡它特指貪。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary adds a piece of Abhidhamma analysis at this point, saying that <em>altered</em> refers to the moment when the mind leaves its state of pure neutrality in the <em>bhavaṅga</em> under the influence of desire. Thus the factor of intention here can be fulfilled not only by a prolonged or intense feeling of desire, but also by a momentary attraction.</td>
<td>《義註》在此加了<a class="reference external" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E6%AF%98%E9%81%94%E7%A3%A8">阿毘達摩</a>的分析，說「<em>變易</em>」是指心在欲望的影響下，離開<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/b/bhava%E1%B9%85ga/">有分</a>的清淨中立狀態的時刻。因此，這裡的意圖因素不僅可以透過持久或強烈的欲望感來實現，也可以透過瞬間的吸引來實現。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The Commentary also tries to limit the range of passion to which this rule applies, saying that it covers only desire for the enjoyment of contact. As we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, the ancient commentators formulated a list of eleven types of lust, each mutually exclusive, and the question of which rule applies to a particular case depends on which type of lust provokes the bhikkhu’s actions. Thus if a bhikkhu lusting for intercourse touches a woman, it says, he incurs only a dukkaṭa as a preliminary to sexual intercourse under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>. If he touches her through his lust for an ejaculation, he incurs a thullaccaya as a preliminary to causing an emission under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0011.html#Sg1">Sg 1</a>. Only if he touches her with the simple desire to enjoy the sensation of contact does he incur a saṅghādisesa under this rule.</td>
<td>《義註》也試圖限制本戒條適用的激情範圍，稱它僅涵蓋享受接觸的欲望。正如我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>中所指出的，古代註釋者列出了十一種貪欲的清單，每種貪欲都是相互排斥的，而哪種戒條適用於某個特定情況的問題取決於哪種類型的貪欲會激起比丘的行動。因此，如果一個欲求性交的比丘觸摸一個女人，它說，他只會犯《突吉羅》，作為<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>下性交的預備。如果他出於射精的欲望而觸摸她，他就會犯《偷蘭遮》，作為<a class="reference external" href="#sg1">《僧殘》一</a>下引起射精的預備。只有當他懷著享受接觸感覺的純粹欲望去觸碰她時，他才會根據本戒條犯《僧殘》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>This system, though very neat and orderly, flies in the face of common sense and, as we noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, contradicts the Vibhaṅga as well, so there is no need to adopt it. We can stick with the Vibhaṅga to this rule and say that <em>any</em> state of passion fulfills the factor of intention here. The Commentary’s discussion, though, is useful in showing that the passion needn’t be full-scale sexual lust. Even a momentary desire to enjoy the sensation of physical contact—overwhelming enough that one acts on it—is enough to fulfill this factor.</td>
<td>這個系統雖然非常整潔有序，但卻違背了常識，並且正如我們在<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>中指出的那樣，也與《經分別》相矛盾，因此沒有必要採用它。我們可以遵循本戒條的《經分別》，並說<em>任何</em>激情狀態都滿足這裡的意圖因素。不過，《義註》的討論有助於顯示激情不一定是全面的性欲。即使是一瞬間想要享受身體接觸的感覺——強烈到足以讓人採取行動——也足以滿足本因素。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga illustrates the effort of making physical contact with a list of activities: rubbing, rubbing up against, rubbing downwards, rubbing upwards, bending down, pulling up, drawing to, pushing away, seizing hold (restraining or pinning down—<em>abhiniggaṇhanā</em>), squeezing, grasping, or touching. The Vinīta-vatthu includes a case of a bhikkhu giving a woman a blow with his shoulder: He too incurs a saṅghādisesa, which shows that the Vibhaṅga’s list is meant to cover all similar actions as well. If a bhikkhu with lustful mind does anything of this sort to a living woman’s body, perceiving her to be a woman, he incurs the full penalty under this rule. As noted under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0010.html#Pr1">Pr 1</a>, mouth-to-mouth penetration with any human being or common animal would incur a thullaccaya. If this act is accompanied by other lustful bodily contact, the thullaccaya would be incurred in addition to any other penalty imposed here.</td>
<td>《經分別》說明了透過一系列活動進行身體接觸的努力：摩擦、偶然碰上、向下摩擦、向上摩擦、向下彎腰、向上拉、拉近、推開、抓住（限制或固定—<em>abhiniggaṇhanā</em>），擠壓、抓握或觸摸。《<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vin%C4%ABta/">Vinīta</a>-<a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.sutta.org/zh_TW/browse/v/vatthu/">vatthu</a>》中有一個<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0176a05">比丘用肩膀碰女人</a>的例子：他也犯了《僧殘》，這表明《經分別》的清單也旨在涵蓋所有類似的行為。如果一個比丘懷著貪欲的心，對一個活著的女人的身體做出這樣的事情，並認為她是一個女人，那麼他將根據本戒條受到完全的懲罰。如<a class="reference external" href="https://siongui.github.io/vinaya-bmc-zh/Section0010/#pr1">《波羅夷》一</a>所述，與任何人類或普通動物進行口對口插入都會犯《偷蘭遮》。如果此行為伴隨著其他淫欲的身體接觸，除了此處施加的任何其他懲罰外，還將犯《偷蘭遮》。</td>

<tr><td>However, in the context of this rule, and other rules in the Pāṭimokkha where paṇḍakas enter into the calculation of an offense, the Commentary does not say whether <em>paṇḍaka</em> covers all five types of paṇḍakas or only those not allowed to ordain. In other words, in the context of these rules do “sprinkled ones” and voyeurs count as paṇḍakas or men? In the context of this rule the practical implications of the distinction are minor: If counted as men, they would be grounds for a dukkaṭa; if paṇḍakas, grounds for a thullaccaya. However, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">Pc 6</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">44</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">45</a>, &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">67</a>, the distinction makes the difference between an offense and a non-offense, and so it is an important one to draw. There seems good reason to count them as men under all rules, for if they could ordain and yet were considered paṇḍakas under these rules, the texts would have been obliged to deal with the issue of how bhikkhus were to treat validly ordained paṇḍakas in their midst in the context of these rules. But they don’t. This shows that the issue never arose, which means that, for the purposes of all the rules, these two types of individuals count as men.</td>
<td>然而，在本戒條的脈絡下，以及《波羅提木叉》中將黃門納入犯戒計算的其他戒條中，《義註》並沒有說明<em>黃門</em>是否涵蓋所有五種類型的黃門或僅涵蓋那些不允許出家的類型。換句話說，在這些戒條的脈絡下，「被注入者」和窺淫癖者算是「黃門」還是「男人」？在本戒條的戒條下，這種區別的實際含義是較不重要的：如果被算作男人，他們將成為《突吉羅》的理由；如果是黃門，則為《偷蘭遮》的理由。然而，在<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0016.html#Pc6">《波逸提》六</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc44">四四</a>、<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0020.html#Pc45">四五</a>和<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0022.html#Pc67">六七</a>下，這一區別決定了犯戒和不犯之間的區別，因此這是一個重要的問題。似乎有充分的理由在所有戒條下將他們視為男人，因為如果他們能夠出家，但在這些戒條下仍被視為黃門，那麼文獻就必須處理比丘如何對待他們之中的有效出家的黃門的問題。但文獻沒有。這表明這個問題從未出現過，這意味著，就所有戒條而言，這兩類人都算是男性。</td>

<tr><td>As for <em>female yakkhas</em>, the Commentary says that this also includes female devas. There is an ancient story in Chieng Mai of a bhikkhu who was visited by a dazzling heavenly maiden late one night while he was meditating alone in a cave at Wat Umong. She told him not to touch her, but he did—and went immediately out of his mind. The moral: This is one thullaccaya not to be taken lightly.</td>
