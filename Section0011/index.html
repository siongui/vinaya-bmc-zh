<tr><td>This term means “involving the Community in the initial <em>(ādi)</em> and subsequent <em>(sesa)</em> acts.” It derives from the fact that the Community is the agent that initially calls on the bhikkhu who breaks any of the rules in this category to undergo the penalty (of <em>mānatta</em>, penance, and <em>parivāsa</em>, probation), subsequently reimposes the penalty if he does not properly carry it out, and finally lifts the penalty when he does. There are thirteen training rules here, the first nine entailing a saṅghādisesa immediately on transgression, the last four only after the offender has been rebuked three times as part of a Community transaction.</td>
<td>這個術語的意思是「讓僧團參與初始 <em>(ādi)</em> 和後續 <em>(sesa)</em> 行為」。它源於這樣一個事實，即僧團是最初要求違反此類戒條的比丘接受懲罰（ <em>mānatta</em> ，贖罪(摩那埵)，和 <em>parivāsa</em> ，別住(波利婆沙)）的代理，如果他沒有正確執行，則隨後重新施加懲罰，最終當他正確執行後解除懲罰。此處有十三個學處（訓練戒條），前九個在違反時即犯《僧殘》，最後四個只有在違反者作為僧伽羯磨的一部分被訶責三次之後才犯《僧殘》。</td>

<tr><td>“Now at that time Ven. Seyyasaka was leading the celibate life dissatisfied. Because of this, he was thin, wretched, unattractive, and pale, his body covered with veins. Ven. Udāyin saw that Ven. Seyyasaka was thin… his body covered with veins. On seeing him, he said to him, ‘Seyyasaka, my friend, why are you thin… your body covered with veins? Could it be that you’re leading the celibate life dissatisfied?’</td>
<td>「<a class="reference external" href="https://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=N01n0001_002#0153a05">爾時，施越尊者過著不滿的梵行生活</a>。是故，他形體枯瘦，容貌憔悴，筋脈悉現。優陀夷尊者看到了施越尊者形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。一見到他，就對他說：『友！施越！，你為什麼形體枯瘦…筋脈悉現？難道你對梵行生活不滿意？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘Yes, friend.’</td>
<td>「『是的，朋友。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘In that case, eat as you like and sleep as you like and bathe as you like; and having eaten, slept, and bathed as you like, when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails the mind, emit semen having attacked (!) with your hand.’</td>
<td>「『既然如此，想吃就吃，想睡就睡，想沐浴就沐浴；隨心所欲地飲食、睡眠、沐浴，當不滿生起、欲念侵襲心時，就用手攻擊（！）射出精液。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘But is it okay to do that?’</td>
<td>「『但是這樣做可以嗎？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘Of course. I do it myself.’</td>
<td>「『當然。我自己也這樣做。』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“So then Ven. Seyyasaka ate as he liked and slept as he liked… and when dissatisfaction arose and lust assailed his mind, he would emit semen having attacked with his hand. Then it wasn’t long before he became attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. So the bhikkhus who were his friends said to him, ‘Before, friend Seyyasaka, you were thin… your body covered with veins. But now you are attractive, with rounded features, a clear complexion, and very bright skin. Could it be that you’re taking medicine?’</td>
<td>「於是，施越尊者想吃就吃，想睡就睡……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，他就會用手攻擊射出精液。然後沒多久，他就變得很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。因此，他的朋友比丘們對他說：『以前，朋友施越，你形體枯瘦……筋脈悉現。但現在的你很有魅力，五官圓潤，容貌光澤。難道是你在吃藥？』</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>“‘No, I’m not taking medicine, my friends. I just eat as I like and sleep as I like… and when dissatisfaction arises and lust assails my mind, I emit semen having attacked with my hand.’</td>
<td>「『不，我沒吃藥，朋友們。我只是隨心所欲地吃飯，隨心所欲地睡覺……當不滿生起，欲念侵襲心時，我用手攻擊射出精液。』</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>This rule, in its outline form, is one of the simplest to explain. In its details, though, it is one of the most complex, not only because the subject is a sensitive matter but also because the Commentary deviates from the Vibhaṅga in its explanations of two of the three factors that constitute the full offense.</td>
<td>本戒條的大綱形式是最容易解釋的戒條之一。然而，就其細節而言，它是最複雜的之一，不僅因為該主題是一個敏感問題，而且因為《義註》在對構成完整違犯的三個因素中的兩個的解釋中偏離了《經分別》。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>The three factors are result, intention, and effort: emission of semen caused by an intentional effort. When all three factors are present, the offense is a saṅghādisesa. If the last two—intention and effort—are present, the offense is a thullaccaya. Any single factor or any other combination of two factors—i.e., intention and result without making a physical effort, or effort and result without intention—is not grounds for an offense.</td>
<td>這三個因素是結果、意圖和努力：由於有意的努力而導致精液的排出。當這三個因素都存在時，該違犯就是《僧殘》。如果最後兩項——意圖和努力——都存在，那麼該違犯就是《偷蘭遮》。任何單一因素或兩個因素的任何其他組合——即沒有做出肉體的努力的意圖和結果，或沒有意圖的努力和結果——都不是犯戒。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>It may seem strange to list the factor of result first, but I want to explain it first partly because, in understanding the types of intention and effort covered by this rule, it is necessary to know what they are aimed at, and also because result is the one factor where the Vibhaṅga and Commentary are in basic agreement.</td>
<td>首先列出結果因素似乎很奇怪，但我想先解釋一下，部分原因是，在理解本戒條所涵蓋的意圖和努力類型時，有必要知道它們的目的是什麼，也因為結果是《經分別》和《義註》基本上一致的因素之一。</td>

<tr><td>The Vibhaṅga states that semen can come in ten colors—a classification derived from a diagnostic practice in ancient Indian medicine in which a doctor would examine his male patients’ ejaculates as a way of diagnosing their health. After presenting a long series of wheels based on these ten colors of semen, the Vibhaṅga arrives at the simple conclusion that the color and quality of the semen are irrelevant to the offense. This suggests that a bhikkhu who has had a vasectomy can still commit an offense under this rule, because he can still discharge the various components that go into seminal fluid—minus only the sperm—at orgasm.</td>
<td>《經分別》指出，精液有十種顏色，這種分類源自古印度醫學的診斷實踐，醫生會檢查男性患者的射精，以此作為診斷其健康狀況的一種方式。在根據這十種顏色的精液提出了一長系列的輪子之後，《經分別》得出了一個簡單的結論：精液的顏色和品質與犯戒無關。這表明，接受過輸精管結紮手術的比丘仍然可以犯下這條戒條，因為他仍然可以在性高潮時排出進入精液的各種成分（僅除去精子）。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although the Vibhaṅga adds that semen is discharged when it “falls from its base,” it does not discuss this point in any detail. The Commentary discusses three opinions as to precisely when this happens in the course of sexual stimulation. Although its discussion is framed in terms of the physiology of ejaculation as understood at the time, its conclusion is clear: Semen moves from its base when “having made the whole body shake, it is released and descends into the urinary tract”—in other words, at the point of orgasm. The Commentary further explains that semen falls from its base when it enters the urinary tract, because from that point on the process is irreversible. Thus if the process of sexual stimulation has reached this point, the factor of result has been fulfilled even if one tries to prevent the semen from leaving the body at orgasm by pinching the end of one’s penis. Once in the urinary tract, it has already fallen from its base, so whether it then leaves the body is irrelevant as far as the factors of the offense are concerned.</td>
<td>儘管《經分別》補充說，當精液「從基底落下」時，精液就會被排出，但它並沒有詳細討論這一點。關於這種情況在性刺激過程中何時發生，《義註》討論了三種觀點。儘管它的討論是以當時所理解的射精生理學為框架的，但它的結論很明確：當「使整個身體搖晃時，它被釋放並下降到尿道」時，精液從其基底移動—換句話說，在性高潮的時候。《義註》進一步解釋說，精液在進入尿道時會從其基底落下，因為從那時起，該過程是不可逆轉的。因此，如果性刺激的過程達到了這一點，即使在性高潮時試圖透過捏住陰莖末端來阻止精液離開身體，結果因素也已經滿足。一旦進入尿道，它就已經從基底落下，因此就犯戒因素而言，它是否離開身體並不重要。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Although some sub-sub-commentaries have ventured a more cautious opinion than the Commentary’s—saying that semen counts as having fallen from its base when there appears a small amount of the clear alkaline fluid produced by the prostate and Cowper’s glands prior to ejaculation—there is nothing in the Vibhaṅga to prove the Commentary wrong.</td>
<td>儘管一些《複註》的再註釋提出了比《義註》更謹慎的觀點，即當射精前的前列腺和考珀氏腺產生少量透明鹼性液體時，精液就被視為從其基底落下。《經分別》中沒有任何內容可以證明《義註》是錯誤的。</td>
